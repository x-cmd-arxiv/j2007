The observed spectra show three prominent velocity\ncomponents at V_LSR = -42, -38, and -34 km s^-1, with the masers in SW\nredshifted and those in NE blueshifted.

When convergence is only in the sense of\nfinite-dimensional distributions then the limit does not have to be a\ndiffusion. However, we show that as long as the drift terms satisfy a Lipschitz\ncondition and the limit is continuous in probability, then it will lie in a\nclass of processes that we refer to as almost-continuous diffusions. These\nprocesses are strong Markov and satisfy an `almost-continuity' condition. We\nalso give a simple condition for the limit to be a continuous diffusion. These\nresults contrast with the multidimensional case where, as we show with an\nexample, a sequence of two dimensional martingale diffusions can converge to a\nprocess that is both discontinuous and non-Markov.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2007 19:01:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Aug 2008 19:23:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-14"}

Recent simulations and observations\nare converging on the view that the extreme luminosity of quasars is fueled in\nmajor mergers of gas-rich galaxies. In such a picture, quasars are expected to\nbe located in regions with a higher density of galaxies on small scales where\nmergers are more likely to take place. However, in this picture, the activity\nobserved in low-luminosity AGN is due to secular processes that are less\ndependent on the local galaxy density. To test this hypothesis, we compare the\nlocal photometric galaxy density on kiloparsec scales around spectroscopic Type\nI and Type II quasars to the local density around lower luminosity\nspectroscopic Type I and Type II AGN. To minimize projection effects and\nevolution in the photometric galaxy sample we use to characterize AGN\nenvironments, we place our random control sample at the same redshift as our\nAGN and impose a narrow redshift window around both the AGN and control\ntargets. We find that higher luminosity AGN have more overdense environments\ncompared to lower luminosity AGN on all scales out to our $2\\Mpchseventy$\nlimit. Additionally, in the range $0.3\\leqslant z\\leqslant 0.6$, Type II\nquasars have similarly overdense environments to those of bright Type I quasars\non all scales out to our $2\\Mpchseventy$ limit, while the environment of dimmer\nType I quasars appears to be less overdense than the environment of Type II\nquasars. We see increased overdensity for Type II AGN compared to Type I AGN on\nscales out to our limit of $2\\Mpchseventy$ in overlapping redshift ranges.

However, these solutions often rely on ad-hoc\noptimization approaches, which ignore the different environmental dynamics\nexperienced at various layers by a user and violate the layered network\narchitecture of the protocol stack by requiring layers to provide access to\ntheir internal protocol parameters to other layers. This paper presents a new\ntheoretic foundation for cross-layer optimization, which allows each layer to\nmake autonomous decisions individually, while maximizing the utility of the\nwireless user by optimally determining what information needs to be exchanged\namong layers. Hence, this cross-layer framework does not change the current\nlayered architecture. Specifically, because the wireless user interacts with\nthe environment at various layers of the protocol stack, the cross-layer\noptimization problem is formulated as a layered Markov decision process (MDP)\nin which each layer adapts its own protocol parameters and exchanges\ninformation (messages) with other layers in order to cooperatively maximize the\nperformance of the wireless user. The message exchange mechanism for\ndetermining the optimal cross-layer transmission strategies has been designed\nfor both off-line optimization and on-line dynamic adaptation.

There, the\nexperiments are aiming to test different scenarios for elementary particles\ninteractions from SUSY, Extra dimensions to others. In fact, SUSY was invented\nto kill the conceptual problems existing in the conventional Standard model\n\\textit{i.e.} the Hierarchy problem. However, in recent years, certain theories\nwhich was rejected in the past like the wrong sign $\\phi^{4}$ theory is now\nwell known to be a truly physically acceptable theory. Here, we analyze the\nrenormalization group flow of the different parameters in the theory. We find\nthat, rather than the conventional $\\phi^{4}$ theory and because the theory is\nasymptotically free, it does not sufferer from the catastrophic blow up of the\nmass parameter for UV scales. This feature greatly recommend that this theory\nis a plausible candidate to play the role of the $SU(2)\\times U(1)$ symmetry\nbreaking in the standard model. If this picture will agree with the\nexperimental results from LHC, then the Higgs particle was massless in the far\npast. Moreover, the cosmological constant problem as a Hierarchy problem may be\nsolved too. However, when trying to calculate the metric operator, we expected\nthat the equivalent Hermitian theory may attain non-remormalizabe terms and\nthus the theory is incalculable. In fact, we show that there exists a Hermitian\nand renormalizable equivalent theory though of indefinite metric. We\nreformulated the Klein-Gordon equation in such a way that the wrong sign in the\npropagator attains a new physical meaning that the Higgs particle is made from\nexotic matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Dec 2007 15:45:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 18 Oct 2008 21:07:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-19"}

Within this framework, we demonstrate that the qubit can function as a\nquantum switch between the two resonators, which are assumed to be originally\nindependent. In this three-circuit network, the qubit mediates a geometric\nsecond-order circuit interaction between the otherwise decoupled resonators. In\nthe dispersive regime, it also gives rise to a dynamic second-order\nperturbative interaction. The geometric and dynamic coupling strengths can be\ntuned to be equal, thus permitting to switch on and off the interaction between\nthe two resonators via a qubit population inversion or a shifting of the qubit\noperation point. We also show that our quantum switch represents a flexible\narchitecture for the manipulation and generation of nonclassical microwave\nfield states as well as the creation of controlled multipartite entanglement in\ncircuit QED. In addition, we clarify the role played by the geometric\ninteraction, which constitutes a fundamental property characteristic of\nsuperconducting quantum circuits without counterpart in quantum-optical\nsystems. We develop a detailed theory of the geometric second-order coupling by\nmeans of circuit transformations for superconducting charge and flux qubits.\nFurthermore, we show the robustness of the quantum switch operation with\nrespect to decoherence mechanisms. Finally, we propose a realistic design for a\ntwo-resonator circuit QED setup based on a flux qubit and estimate all the\nrelated parameters. In this manner, we show that this setup can be used to\nimplement a superconducting quantum switch with available technology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Dec 2007 15:47:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Sep 2008 09:37:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Sep 2008 07:28:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-23"}

How do we know that global geometry and\ntopology are robust rather than in a state of chaos? The phenomenon of cosmic\nshear provides an effective way of mapping curvature fluctuations, because it\naffects {\\it any} light rays whether they intercept mass clumps or not. We\ndiscuss a range of astrophysical applications of the principal manifestation of\nshear - the distortion of images. It will be shown that the quickest way of\ntesting the existence of shear in the near Universe is to look at the shape of\nEinstein rings. The fact that most of these rings are circular to a large\nextent means, statistically speaking, shear occurs at a much lower level than\nthe expectation based upon our current understanding of the inhomogeneous\nUniverse. While inflation may account for the mean geometry, it offers no means\nof stabilizing it against the fluctuations caused by non-linear matter clumping\nat low redshift. Either this clumping is actually much less severe, or the\nphysical mechanism responsible for shaping the large scale curvature has been\nactive not only during the very early epochs, but also at all subsequent times.\nMight it be the vital `interface' between expansion on Hubble distances and\ngravity on cluster scales and beneath?\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2007 23:06:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}
