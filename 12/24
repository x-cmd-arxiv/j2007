It also shed light\non the problems with the present day numerical modeling of CR. In this paper we\nfocus on the analytical way of describing CR propagation and scattering, which\nshould be used in synergy with the numerical studies. In particular, we use\nrecently established scaling laws for MHD modes to obtain the transport\nproperties for CRs. We include nonlinear effects arising from large scale\ntrapping, to remove the 90 degree divergence. We determine how the efficiency\nof the scattering and CR mean free path depend on the characteristics of\nionized media, e.g. plasma $\\beta$, Coulomb collisional mean free path.\nImplications for particle transport in interstellar medium and solar corona are\ndiscussed.

The random nature of this\nprocess may make the poloidal field in one hemisphere stronger than that in the\nother hemisphere at the end of a cycle. We expect this to induce an asymmetry\nin the next sunspot cycle. We look for evidence of this in the observational\ndata and then model it theoretically with our dynamo code. Since actual polar\nfield measurements exist only from 1970s, we use the polar faculae number data\nrecorded by Sheeley (1991) as a proxy of the polar field and estimate the\nhemispheric asymmetry of the polar field in different solar minima during the\nmajor part of the twentieth century. This asymmetry is found to have a\nreasonable correlation with the asymmetry of the next cycle. We then run our\ndynamo code by feeding information about this asymmetry at the successive\nminima and compare with observational data. We find that the theoretically\ncomputed asymmetries of different cycles compare favourably with the\nobservational data, the correlation coefficient being 0.73. Due to the coupling\nbetween the two hemispheres, any hemispheric asymmetry tends to get attenuated\nwith time. The hemispheric asymmetry of a cycle either from observational data\nor from theoretical calculation statistically tends to be less than the\nasymmetry in the polar field (as inferred from the faculae data) in the\npreceding minimum.

It provides low dimensional 6\\otimes6 bound\nentangled states with nonzero distillable key.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Dec 2007 12:33:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-12-27"}

We use the photometry of the SDSS\nu,g,r,i images of DDO 68 to estimate its stellar population ages. The available\nH-alpha-images of DDO 68 were used to select several representative regions\nwithout nebular emission. The analysis of obtained colours was performed via\ncomparison with the PEGASE2 evolutionary tracks for various star formation (SF)\nlaws, including the two extremes: instantaneous SF and continuous SF with\nconstant SF rate. The (u-g), (g-r) colours derived for all selected regions,\nare consistent with a few `instantaneous' SF episodes with ages from ~0.05 to\n~1Gyr. Combining the fluxes and colours of visible stellar subsystems with\nPEGASE2 models, we have estimated the total mass of visible stars in DDO 68 of\n~2.4x10^7 Mo. This comprises only ~6% of the total galaxy baryonic mass. All\navailable data do not contradict to the option that DDO 68 is a kind of very\nrare candidate `young' galaxy, whose dominant stellar build-up took place in\ncourse of the recent (with the first encounter ~1 Gyr ago) merger of two very\ngas-rich disks. DDO 68 best approximates on its properties cosmologically young\nlow-mass galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Dec 2007 15:44:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-12-27"}
