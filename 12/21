The new gauge symmetry does not necessarily\nforbid all renormalizable R-parity violating interactions among the MSSM\nfields, and may allow for either lepton number or baryon number violation at\nthe renormalizable level. However, the proton decay problem resurfaces with the\nintroduction of new TeV-scale exotic fields which are required for gauge\nanomaly cancellations.

However, in order that fine tuning be absent, the\nlightest CP-even Higgs boson h should have mass ~100 GeV and SM couplings to\ngauge bosons and fermions. The only way that this can be consistent with LEP\nlimits is if h decays primarily via h->aa->4 tau or 4j but not 4b, where a is\nthe lighter of the two pseudo-scalar Higgses that are present in the NMSSM.\nInterestingly, m_a < 2 m_b is natural in the NMSSM with m_a > 2 m_tau somewhat\npreferred.

Although based on traditional four-dimensional regulators, the key new\nfeature of these higher-dimensional regulators is that they are specifically\ndesigned to handle mixed spacetimes in which some dimensions are infinitely\nlarge and others are compactified. Moreover, unlike most other regulators which\nhave been used in the extra-dimension literature, these regulators are designed\nto respect the original higher-dimensional Lorentz and gauge symmetries that\nexist prior to compactification, and not merely the four-dimensional symmetries\nwhich remain afterward. This distinction is particularly relevant for\ncalculations of the physics of the excited Kaluza-Klein modes themselves, and\nnot merely their radiative effects on zero modes. By respecting the full\nhigher-dimensional symmetries, our regulators avoid the introduction of\nspurious terms which would not have been easy to disentangle from the physical\neffects of compactification.

Because of the different Galactic\ncolumn densities in the two pointing directions, the observed emission from the\nGalactic halo has a different shape in the two spectra. We make use of this\ndifference when modeling the spectra to separate the absorbed halo emission\nfrom the unabsorbed foreground emission from the Local Bubble (LB). The\ntemperatures and emission measures we obtain are significantly different from\nthose determined from an earlier analysis of XMM-Newton spectra from the same\npointing directions. We attribute this difference to the presence of previously\nunrecognized solar wind charge exchange (SWCX) contamination in the XMM-Newton\nspectra, possibly due to a localized enhancement in the solar wind moving\nacross the line of sight. Contemporaneous solar wind data from ACE show nothing\nunusual during the course of the XMM-Newton observations. Our results therefore\nsuggest that simply examining contemporaneous solar wind data might be\ninadequate for determining if a spectrum of the SXRB is contaminated by SWCX\nemission. If our Suzaku spectra are not badly contaminated by SWCX emission,\nour best-fitting LB model gives a temperature of log T = 5.98 +0.03/-0.04 and a\npressure of p/k = 13,100-16,100 cm^-3 K. These values are lower than those\nobtained from other recent observations of the LB, suggesting the LB may not be\nisothermal and may not be in pressure equilibrium.

With a high\nintrinsic hydrogen column density obscuring the source (log(N_H/cm^-2) >~ 19.2)\nor a hard power-law spectrum combined with some obscuration (e.g.\ndlog(F_\\nu)/dlog(\\nu) >~ -1.2 at log(N_H/cm^-2) >~ 18.0), the thickness of the\nfront exceeds ~1 physical Mpc and may be measurable from the morphology of its\nredshifted 21cm signal. We find that the highly ionized inner part of the\nfront, which may be probed by Lyman line absorption spectra, remains sharp for\nbright quasars unless a large obscuring column (log(N_H/cm^-2) >~ 19.2) removes\nmost of their ionizing photons up to ~40 eV. For obscured sources with\nlog(N_H/cm^-2) >~ 19.8, embedded in a significantly neutral IGM, the black\nLyman-alpha trough (where the neutral fraction is ~10^-3) underestimates the\nsize of the HII region by a factor of >~4.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2007 20:42:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2008 19:25:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-10"}

In an instance of this problem, we are\ngiven an undirected graph G=(V,E), a set of terminals R, and non-negative costs\nc_e for all edges e in E. Any tree that contains all terminals is called a\nSteiner tree; the goal is to find a minimum-cost Steiner tree. The nodes V R\nare called Steiner nodes.\n  The best approximation algorithm known for the Steiner tree problem is due to\nRobins and Zelikovsky (SIAM J. Discrete Math, 2005); their greedy algorithm\nachieves a performance guarantee of 1+(ln 3)/2 ~ 1.55. The best known linear\n(LP)-based algorithm, on the other hand, is due to Goemans and Bertsimas (Math.\nProgramming, 1993) and achieves an approximation ratio of 2-2/|R|. In this\npaper we establish a link between greedy and LP-based approaches by showing\nthat Robins and Zelikovsky's algorithm has a natural primal-dual interpretation\nwith respect to a novel partition-based linear programming relaxation. We also\nexhibit surprising connections between the new formulation and existing LPs and\nwe show that the new LP is stronger than the bidirected cut formulation.\n  An instance is b-quasi-bipartite if each connected component of G R has at\nmost b vertices. We show that Robins' and Zelikovsky's algorithm has an\napproximation ratio better than 1+(ln 3)/2 for such instances, and we prove\nthat the integrality gap of our LP is between 8/7 and (2b+1)/(b+1).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2007 21:06:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-12-24"}

We investigate such an\nenvironmental impact on both real-space and redshift-space galaxy clustering\nstatistics using a semi-analytic model derived from the Millennium Simulation.\nWe compare clustering statistics from original SAM galaxy samples and shuffled\nones with environmental influence on galaxy properties eliminated.

Analysis of ROTSE-IIIb visible\nlight observations of M31, taken 10.6 hours after the burst and covering 42% of\nthe GRB error region, did not reveal any optical transient down to a limiting\nmagnitude of 17.1. We inspected archival and proprietary XMM-Newton X-ray\nobservations of the intersection of the GRB error quadrilateral and M31,\nobtained about four weeks prior to the outburst, in order to look for periodic\nvariable X-ray sources. No SGR or Anomalous X-ray Pulsar (AXP) candidates\n(periods in range 1 to 20 s) were detected. We discuss the possibility of\ndetecting extragalactic SGRs/AXPs by identifying their periodic X-ray light\ncurves. Our simulations suggest that the probability of detecting the periodic\nX-ray signal of one of the known Galactic SGRs/AXPs, if placed in M31, is about\n10% (50%), using 50 ks (2 Ms) XMM-Newton exposures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2007 21:50:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-18"}

Using both\nboundary-integral simulations and small-deformation theory we show that a\nquasi-static change of the flow vorticity gives rise to a hysteretic response\nof the drop shape, with rapid changes between the compact and elongated\nsolutions at critical values of the vorticity. In flows with sinusoidal\ntemporal variation of the vorticity we find chaotic drop dynamics in response\nto the periodic forcing. A cascade of period-doubling bifurcations is found to\nbe directly responsible for the transition to chaos. In random flows we obtain\na bimodal drop-length distribution. Some analogies with the dynamics of\nmacromolecules and vesicles are pointed out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2007 01:02:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

A mathematical model is proposed\nfor the principal feature of consciousness assumed in EEC, namely its ability\n(in the state of sleep, trance or meditation, when the explicit consciousness\nis disabled) to obtain information from all alternative classical realities\n(Everett's worlds) and select the favorable realities. To represent this\nability, a mathematical operation called postcorrection is introduced, which\ncorrects the present state to guarantee certain characteristics of the future\nstate. Evolution of living matter is thus determined by goals (first of all by\nthe goal of survival) as well as by causes. The resulting theory, in a way\nsymmetrical in time direction, follows from a sort of antropic principle.\nPossible criteria for postcorrection and corresponding phenomena in the sphere\nof life are classified. Both individual and collective criteria of survival are\nconsidered as well as the criteria providing certain quality of life and those\nwhich are irrelevant to the life quality. The phenomena of free will and direct\nsighting of truth (e.g. scientific insight) are explained in these terms. The\nproblem of artificial intellect and the role of brain look differently in the\nframework of this theory. Automats may perform intellectual operations, but not\npostcorrection, therefore artificial intellect but not an artificial life can\nbe created. The brain serves as an interface between the body and\nconsciousness, but the most profound level of consciousness is not a function\nof brain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2007 14:18:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-12-27"}

For fully\nabsorbing boundary condition the long time diffusion coefficient is found to be\n$D(t)=5 a^2/(12 f D_{0} t) +O((D_0t/a^2)^{-2})$, to the first order of\nperturbation theory. Here $f$ is small but non-zero, $D_0$ the diffusion\ncoefficient in the absence of spheres, and $a$ the radius of the spheres. The\nvalidity of this perturbative result is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2007 05:54:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-29"}

Charge disorder is assumed to be\nconfined to macroion surfaces surrounded by a cloud of mobile neutralizing\ncounterions in an aqueous solvent. A general formalism is developed by assuming\nthat the disorder is partially annealed (with purely annealed and purely\nquenched disorder included as special cases), i.e., we assume in general that\nthe disorder undergoes a slow dynamics relative to fast-relaxing counterions\nmaking it possible thus to study the stationary-state properties of the system\nusing methods similar to those available in equilibrium statistical mechanics.\nBy focusing on the specific case of two planar surfaces of equal mean surface\ncharge and disorder variance, it is shown that partial annealing of the\nquenched disorder leads to renormalization of the mean surface charge density\nand thus a reduction of the inter-plate repulsion on the mean-field or\nweak-coupling level. In the strong-coupling limit, charge disorder induces a\nlong-range attraction resulting in a continuous disorder-driven collapse\ntransition for the two surfaces as the disorder variance exceeds a threshold\nvalue. Disorder annealing further enhances the attraction and, in the limit of\nlow screening, leads to a global attractive instability in the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2007 09:25:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 May 2009 22:21:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-24"}

We present simulations of the\nprocedure for 2D model systems based on numerical solutions of the\ntime-dependent Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation, and present results from further\npost-processing of the reconstructed orbitals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2007 15:04:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In particular, the computational results contradicts the\nexperimental finding that four lambda-lac mutants both show stable lysogeny and\nare inducible. This work hence suggests either that the four out of 900 mutants\nare special, or that lambda lysogeny and inducibility are holistic effects\ninvolving other molecular players or other mechanisms, or both.

Based on the causal Israel-Stewart formalism, this code describes the\ntransverse evolution of longitudinally boost-invariant systems without\nazimuthal symmetry around the beam direction. Shear viscosity is shown to\ndecelerate the longitudinal and accelerate the transverse hydrodynamic\nexpansion. For fixed initial conditions, this leads to a longer quark-gluon\nplasma (QGP) lifetime, larger radial flow in the final state, and flatter\ntransverse momentum spectra for the emitted hadrons compared to ideal fluid\ndynamic simulations. We find that the elliptic flow coefficient v_2 is\nparticularly sensitive to shear viscosity: even the lowest value allowed by the\nAdS/CFT conjecture, eta/s=1/4pi, suppresses v_2 enough to have significant\nconsequences for the phenomenology of heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic\nHeavy Ion Collider. A comparison between our numerical results and earlier\nanalytic estimates of viscous effects within a blast-wave model parametrization\nof the expanding fireball at freeze-out reveals that the full dynamical theory\nleads to much tighter constraints for the specific shear viscosity eta/s,\nthereby supporting the notion that the quark-gluon plasma created at RHIC\nexhibits almost ``perfect fluidity''.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2007 15:15:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 May 2008 18:19:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}
