In particular, it\nprovides an exact evaluation of the stopping power to leading and\nnext-to-leading order in the plasma coupling, with the systematic error being\nof cubic order. Consequently, the calculation is near-exact for a weakly\ncoupled plasma, and quite accurate for a moderately coupled plasma.

The\nnovel feature of this work is the exploration of a wide range of efficiencies\nof each heating process. While the latter two can provide a substantial amount\nof energy, neither mechanism operating alone can produce nor maintain an ICM in\nthermal balance over cosmological timescales, in stark contrast with\nobservations.

Until\nvery recently, the Galactic population consisted of a relatively well studied\ndisk population, a somewhat studied smaller bulge population and a mostly\nunknown, but potentially large halo population. It has been argued that the\nhalo population may produce a signal that is much stronger (factor of ~5 in\nspectral amplitude) than the disk population. However, this surprising result\nwas not based on an actual calculation of a halo white dwarf population but was\nderived on (i) the assumption that one can extrapolate the halo population\nproperties from those of the disk population and (ii) the postulated\n(unrealistically) high number of white dwarfs in the halo. We perform the first\ncalculation of a halo white dwarf population using population synthesis models.\nOur comparison with the signal arising from double white dwarfs in the Galactic\ndisk+bulge clearly shows that it is impossible for the double white dwarf halo\nsignal to exceed that of the rest of the Galaxy. Using microlensing results to\ngive an upper limit on the content of white dwarfs in the halo (~30 % baryonic\nmass in white dwarfs), our predicted halo signal is a factor of 10 lower than\nthe disk+bulge signal. Even in the implausible case where all of the baryonic\nhalo mass is found in white dwarfs, the halo signal does not become comparable\nto that of the disk+bulge, and thus would still have a negligible effect on the\ndetection of other LISA sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2007 23:13:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2008 23:39:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-16"}

In a pilot\nstudy to attempt to distinguish between these scenarios, we have measured the\nplanetary nebula (PN) kinematics of the nearby S0 system NGC 1023. Using the\nPlanetary Nebula Spectrograph, we have detected and measured the line-of-sight\nvelocities of 204 candidate PNe in the field of this galaxy. Out to\nintermediate radii, the system displays the kinematics of a normal\nrotationally-supported disc system. After correction of its rotational\nvelocities for asymmetric drift, the galaxy lies just below the spiral galaxy\nTully-Fisher relation, as one would expect for a fading system. However, at\nlarger radii the kinematics undergo a gradual but major transition to random\nmotion with little rotation. This transition does not seem to reflect a change\nin the viewing geometry or the presence of a distinct halo component, since the\nnumber counts of PNe follow the same simple exponential decline as the stellar\ncontinuum with the same projected disc ellipticity out to large radii. The\ngalaxy's small companion, NGC 1023A, does not seem to be large enough to have\ncaused the observed modification either. This combination of properties would\nseem to indicate a complex evolutionary history in either the transition to\nform an S0 or in the past life of the spiral galaxy from which the S0 formed.\nMore data sets of this type from both spirals and S0s are needed in order to\ndefinitively determine the relationship between these types of system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2007 00:47:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

However, it has recently been shown that perfect feedback does allow\ngreat improvements in the asymptotic tradeoff between end-to-end delay and\nprobability of error, even for symmetric channels at high rate. Since gains are\nclaimed with ideal instantaneous feedback, it is natural to wonder whether\nthese improvements remain if the feedback is unreliable or otherwise limited.\n  Here, packet-erasure channels are considered on both the forward and feedback\nlinks. First, the feedback channel is considered as a given and a strategy is\ngiven to balance forward and feedback error correction in the suitable\ninformation-theoretic limit of long end-to-end delays. At high enough rates,\nperfect-feedback performance is asymptotically attainable despite having only\nunreliable feedback! Second, the results are interpreted in the zero- sum case\nof \"half-duplex\" nodes where the allocation of bandwidth or time to the\nfeedback channel comes at the direct expense of the forward channel. It turns\nout that even here, feedback is worthwhile since dramatically lower asymptotic\ndelays are possible by appropriately balancing forward and feedback error\ncorrection.\n  The results easily generalize to channels with strictly positive\nzero-undeclared-error capacities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2007 04:08:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-12-07"}

The notion of\nend-to-end delay is made precise by considering a sequential setting in which\nsource symbols are revealed in real time and need to be reconstructed at the\ndecoder within a certain fixed latency requirement. Upper bounds are derived on\nthe reliability functions with delay when side-information is known only to the\ndecoder as well as when it is also known at the encoder.\n  When the encoder is not ignorant of the side-information (including the\ntrivial case when there is no side-information), it is possible to have\nsubstantially better tradeoffs between delay and probability of error at all\nrates. This shows that there is a fundamental price of ignorance in terms of\nend-to-end delay when the encoder is not aware of the side information. This\neffect is not visible if only fixed-block-length codes are considered. In this\nway, side-information in source-coding plays a role analogous to that of\nfeedback in channel coding.\n  While the theorems in this paper are asymptotic in terms of long delays and\nlow probabilities of error, an example is used to show that the qualitative\neffects described here are significant even at short and moderate delays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2007 04:38:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-12-07"}

Many theoretical studies, focussing on different aspects\nsuch as e.g. disk emissivity or ionization, have been conducted in the context\nof the Standard Accretion Disk (SAD) model, where no jet is present. We wish to\ncalculate the structure of YSO accretion disks in an approach that takes into\naccount the presence of the protostellar jets. The radial structure of these\nJet Emitting Disks (JED) should then be compared to that of standard accretion\ndisks. The analytical treatment used in this work is very similar to that of\nstandard accretion disks but is using the parameter space of Magnetised\nAccretion-Ejection Structures that include the jet torque on the underlying\ndisk. In this framework, the analytical expressions of key quantities, such as\nmid-plane temperatures, surface densities or disk aspect ratio are derived. It\nis found that JEDs present a structure very different from the SADs and that\ncan be observationally tested. The implications on planet formation in the\ninner regions of accretion disks are briefly discussed.

We find\nthat BCGs have steeper size-luminosity ($R \\propto L^\\alpha$) and Faber-Jackson\n($L \\propto \\sigma^\\beta$) relations than the bulk of early type galaxies.\nFurthermore, the power-law indices ($\\alpha$ and $\\beta$) in these relations\nincrease as the isophotal limits become deeper. For isophotal limits from 22 to\n25 $\\magsec$, BCGs are usually larger than the bulk of early type galaxies, and\na large fraction ($\\sim 49%$) of BCGs have disky isophotal shapes. The\ndifferences in the scaling relations are consistent with a scenario where the\ndynamical structure and formation route of BCGs may be different from the bulk\nof early type galaxies, in particular dry (dissipationless) mergers may play a\nmore important role in their formation; we highlight several possible dry\nmerger candidates in our sample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2007 12:52:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2007 14:51:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The question of how systems of multiple planets in\ncircumbinary discs evolve has not yet been addressed.

We also present the results of hydrodynamic simulations of five-planet\nsystems, and study their long term evolution after disc dispersal using a\nN-body code. For the two-planet simulations we assume that the innermost planet\nhas migrated to the edge of the inner cavity and remains trapped there, and\nstudy the subsequent evolution of the system as the outermost planet migrates\ninward.

For values of\nq>1 the systems reach equilibrium configurations in which the planets are\nlocked into mean motion resonances, and remain trapped at the edge of the inner\ncavity without further migration.

With a nominal mission life time of 5 years, and a planned extension\nto 10 years, from a geosynchronous orbit with an inclination of 51.8 degrees,\nWSO-UV will provide observations of exceptional importance for the study of\nmany unsolved astrophysical problems. WSO-UV is implemented in the framework of\na collaboration between Russia (chair), China, Germany, Italy, Spain, and\nUkraine. This book illustrates the results of the feasibility study for the\nField Camera Unit (FCU), a multi-spectral radial instrument on the focal plane\nof WSO-UV. The book provides an overview of the key science topics that are\ndrivers to the participation of the Italian astronomical community in the\nWSO-UV project. The science drivers here illustrated have been used to define\nthe technical requirements for the conceptual and architectural design of the\nField Camera Unit (FCU) focal plane instrument. In Chapter I we show that\nWSO-UV will give a significant contribution to solve the key astronomical\nproblems individuated by the ASTRONET consortium, and which are driving the\nEuropean Space Agency Cosmic Vision program. Chapter II elucidates the\nscientific requirements for WSO-UV FCU instrument, discussed in Chapter I,\nwhich are translated in a list of verifiable top level requirements usable to\nmake the conceptual design of the FCU instrument.
