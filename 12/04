Previous efforts to\nconstrain the distribution attempted to eliminate interlopers from the measured\nprojected number density of satellites and found that the distribution is\ngenerally consistent with the expected dark matter halo profile of the parent\nhosts, with a best-fit power-law slope of ~ -1.7 between projected separations\nof ~30 kpc/h and 0.5 Mpc/h. Here, I use the projected cross-correlation of\nbright and faint galaxies to analyze contributions from satellites and\ninterlopers together, using a halo occupation distribution (HOD) analytic model\nfor galaxy clustering. This approach is tested on mock catalogs constructed\nfrom simulations. I find that analysis of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data\ngives results generally consistent with interloper subtraction methods between\nthe projected separations of 10 kpc/h and 6.3 Mpc/h, although the errors on the\nparameters that constrain the radial profile are large, and larger samples of\ndata are required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2007 16:50:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Jan 2009 13:59:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

This is done within the context of the halo model\nof structure formation, as this allows for the self-consistent inclusion of\nlinear and non-linear redshift space distortions and also for the non-linearity\nof the halo bias. The model is applicable over a wide range of scales: on the\nlargest scales the predictions reduce to those of the standard perturbation\ntheory (PT); on smaller scales they are determined primarily by the nonlinear\nvirial velocities of galaxies within haloes, and this gives rise to the\nU-shaped anisotropy in the reduced bispectrum -- a finger print of the\nFinger-Of-God distortions. We then confront the predictions with bispectrum\nmeasurements from an ensemble of numerical simulations.

However, three\npathway components (proteins PKC, MEK, and ERK) and eleven reaction steps were\ndetermined to be of critical importance by employing a sensitivity coefficient\nas an evaluation index. Each of these sensitive parameters exhibited a similar\nchanging pattern in that a relatively larger increase or decrease in its value\nresulted in a lesser influence on the system's cellular performance. This study\nprovides a novel cross-scaled approach to analyzing sensitivities of\ncomputational model parameters and proposes its application to\ninterdisciplinary biomarker studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2007 19:57:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-12-04"}

Maximally symmetric solutions\nfor the branes and the intersection are found. We find new self-accelerating\nsolutions. In a 6d spacetime, the solutions realize the see-saw modification of\ngravity where the UV scale of the modification to 4d gravity is determined by\n6d Planck scale given by $M_6 \\sim 10^{-3}$eV and the IR scale of the\nmodification is determined by $M_6^2/M_4 \\sim H_0 \\sim 10^{-42}$ GeV where\n$H_0$ is present-day Hubble scale. We find that it is increasingly difficult to\nconstruct phenomenologically viable models in higher-dimensional spacetime due\nto the necessity to have the lower value for the fundamental Planck scale to\nrealize the late time acceleration.

Then, we analyze\nthe mutual information between the black hole and the late time radiation\nregion.

We calculate the critical exponent $\\nu$ along the mobility edge and\nfind it constant and equal to the one of 3D Anderson model, confirming common\nuniversality class. Possible exception is the center of the conduction band,\nwhere either the single parameter scaling is not valid anymore, or finite size\neffects are immense. One of the reasons for such statement is the difference\nbetween results from arithmetic and geometric averaging of conductance at\nspecial energies. Only the geometric mean yields zero critical disorder in band\ncenter, which was theoretically predicted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2007 08:40:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

During one observation GRS 1915+105\nwas in a steady state, while during the three others it showed cycles of X-ray\ndips and spikes (followed by radio flares). We present the time-resolved\nspectroscopy of these cyclesand show that in all cases the hard X-ray component\n(the Comptonized emission from a coronal medium) is suppressed in coincidence\nwith a soft X-ray spike that ends the cycle. We interpret these results as\nevidence that the soft X-ray spike is the trigger of the ejection, and that the\nejected medium is the coronal material. In the steady state observation, the\nX-ray spectrum is indicative of the hard-intermediate state, with the presence\nof a relatively strong emission at 15 GHz. The X-ray spectra are the sum of a\nComptonized component and an extra power law extending to energies >200 keV\nwithout any evidence for a cut-off. We observe a possible correlation of the\nradio flux with that of the power law component, which may indicate that we see\ndirect emission from the jet at hard X-ray energies. We study the energy\ndependence of a ~4 Hz QPO during the hard-intermediate state observation. The\nQPO-``spectrum'' is well modeled by a power law with a cut-off at an energy\nabout 11 keV that clearly differs from the relative contribution of the\nComptonized component to the overall flux.

High resolution X-ray\nspectroscopy has revealed that active stellar coronae show an opposite effect,\nwhich was labeled the Inverse-FIP (IFIP) effect. The correlation found between\ncoronal activity and the FIP/IFIP bias suggested perhaps that flaring activity\nis involved in switching from FIP to IFIP. This work aims at a more systematic\nunderstanding of the FIP trends during stellar flares and complements an\nearlier study based on Chandra alone. The eight brightest X-ray flares observed\nwith XMM-Newton are analyzed and compared with their respective quiescence\nstates. Together with six previous flares observed with Chandra, this\nestablishes the best currently available sample of flares. We look for\nabundance variations during the flare and their correlation with FIP. For that\npurpose, we define a new FIP bias measure. A trend is found where coronae that\nare IFIP biased in quiescence, during flares show a FIP bias with respect to\ntheir quiescence composition. This effect is reversed for coronae that are FIP\nbiased in quiescence. The observed trend is thus consistent with chromospheric\nevaporation rather than with a FIP mechanism operating during flares. It also\nsuggests that the quiescent IFIP bias is real and that the large flares are not\nthe direct cause of the IFIP effect in stellar coronae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2007 11:09:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Fourteen\noperators performed biopsies first under 2-D then 4-D transurethral ultrasound\n(TRUS) guidance (336 biopsies).

For determining each\ncell type, cell-cell interactions are often essential, in addition to\nintracellular gene expression dynamics. Based on dynamical systems theory, we\npropose a mechanism for cell differentiation with regulation of populations of\neach cell type by taking simple cell models with gene expression dynamics. By\nincorporating several interaction kinetics, we found that the cell models with\na single intracellular positive-feedback loop exhibit a cell fate switching,\nwith a change in the total number of cells. The number of a given cell type or\nthe population ratio of each cell type is preserved against the change in the\ntotal number of cells, depending on the form of cell-cell interaction. The\ndifferentiation is a result of bifurcation of cell states via the intercellular\ninteractions, while the population regulation is explained by self-consistent\ndetermination of the bifurcation parameter through cell-cell interactions. The\nrelevance of this mechanism to development and differentiation in several\nmulticellular systems is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2007 15:16:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-12-05"}

We construct the low-energy\neffective theory for the light Higgs-doublet in the limit of small (but\nnonzero) deviations in the rho parameter from one, a limit in which the triplet\nstates become heavy. For small deviations in the rho parameter from one,\nperturbative unitarity of WW scattering breaks down at a scale inversely\nproportional to the renormalized vacuum expectation value of the triplet field\n(or, equivalently, inversely proportional to the square-root of the deviation\nof the rho parameter from one). This result imposes an upper limit on the\nmass-scale of the heavy triplet bosons in a perturbative theory; we show that\nthis upper bound is consistent with dimensional analysis in the low-energy\neffective theory. Recent articles have shown that the triplet bosons do not\ndecouple, in the sense that deviations in the rho parameter from one do not\nnecessarily vanish at one-loop in the limit of large triplet mass. We clarify\nthat, despite the non-decoupling behavior of the Higgs-triplet, this model does\nnot violate the decoupling theorem since it incorporates a large dimensionful\ncoupling. Nonetheless, we show that if the triplet-Higgs boson masses are of\norder the GUT scale, perturbative consistency of the theory requires the\n(properly renormalized) Higgs-triplet vacuum expectation value to be so small\nas to be irrelevant for electroweak phenomenology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2007 15:23:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2007 18:22:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2008 18:46:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
