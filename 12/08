This setup has attracted significant attention and\nseveral relaying protocols have been reported in the literature. However, most\nof the proposed solutions require either centrally coordinated scheduling or\ndetailed channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter side. Here, an\nopportunistic relaying scheme is proposed, which alleviates these limitations.\nThe scheme entails a two-hop communication protocol, in which sources\ncommunicate with destinations only through half-duplex relays. The key idea is\nto schedule at each hop only a subset of nodes that can benefit from\n\\emph{multiuser diversity}. To select the source and destination nodes for each\nhop, it requires only CSI at receivers (relays for the first hop, and\ndestination nodes for the second hop) and an integer-value CSI feedback to the\ntransmitters. For the case when $n$ is large and $m$ is fixed, it is shown that\nthe proposed scheme achieves a system throughput of $m/2$ bits/s/Hz. In\ncontrast, the information-theoretic upper bound of $(m/2)\\log \\log n$ bits/s/Hz\nis achievable only with more demanding CSI assumptions and cooperation between\nthe relays. Furthermore, it is shown that, under the condition that the product\nof block duration and system bandwidth scales faster than $\\log n$, the\nachievable throughput of the proposed scheme scales as $\\Theta ({\\log n})$.\nNotably, this is proven to be the optimal throughput scaling even if\ncentralized scheduling is allowed, thus proving the optimality of the proposed\nscheme in the scaling law sense.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2007 16:19:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2009 07:17:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2009 06:06:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

The theory is developed in terms of vector and matrix equations of\nexterior differential systems, which are not constrained by tensor\ndiffeomorphic equivalences. The first postulate defines the field properties (a\nvector space continuum) of the Cosmological Vacuum in terms of matrices of\nbasis functions that map exact differentials into neighborhoods of exterior\ndifferential 1-forms (potentials). The second postulate requires that the field\nequations must satisfy the First Law of Thermodynamics dynamically created in\nterms of the Lie differential with respect to a process direction field acting\non the exterior differential forms that encode the thermodynamic system. The\nvector space of infinitesimals need not be global and its compliment is used to\ndefine particle properties as topological defects embedded in the field vector\nspace. The potentials, as exterior differential 1-forms, are not (necessarily)\nuniquely integrable: the fibers can be twisted, leading to possible Chiral\nmatrix arrays of certain 3-forms defined as Topological Torsion and Topological\nSpin. A significant result demonstrates how the coefficients of Affine Torsion\nare related to the concept of Field excitations (mass and charge); another\ndemonstrates how thermodynamic evolution can describe the emergence of\ntopological defects in the physical vacuum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2007 16:30:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-12-10"}

This universality allows one to calculate these\nquantities in suitable simplified models and field-theoretical methods are a\nnatural and viable approach for this analysis.

In a few\nwell-studied cases, these ``short GRBs with extended emission'' show no\nevidence for a bright associated supernova (SN). We propose that these events\nare produced by the formation and early evolution of a highly magnetized,\nrapidly rotating neutron star (a ``proto-magnetar'') which is formed from the\naccretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a white dwarf (WD), the merger and collapse\nof a WD-WD binary, or, perhaps, the merger of a double neutron star binary. The\ninitial emission spike is powered by accretion onto the proto-magnetar from a\nsmall disk that is formed during the AIC or merger event. The extended emission\nis produced by a relativistic wind that extracts the rotational energy of the\nproto-magnetar on a timescale ~10-100 s. The ~3-10 s delay between the prompt\nand extended emission is the time required for the newly-formed proto-magnetar\nto cool sufficiently that the neutrino-heated wind from its surface becomes\nultra-relativistic. Because a proto-magnetar ejects little or no Ni56 (< 1e-3\nM_sun), these events should not produce a bright SN-like transient. We model\nthe extended emission from GRB060614 using spin-down calculations of a cooling\nproto-magnetar, finding reasonable agreement with observations for a magnetar\nwith an initial rotation period of ~1 ms and a surface dipole field of ~3e15 G.\nIf GRBs are indeed produced by AIC or WD-WD mergers, they should occur within a\nmixture of both early and late-type galaxies and should not produce strong\ngravitational wave emission.

We here show that in a three-state loop\nlinkage, a Hilbert-space Householder reflection breaks the loop and presents\nthe linkage as a single chain. With certain conditions on the interaction\nparameters, this chain can break into a simple two-state system and an\nadditional spectator state. Alternatively, a two-photon resonance condition in\nthis Householder-basis chain can be enforced, which heralds the existence of\nanother spectator state. These spectator states generalize the usual dark state\nto include contributions from all three bare basis states and disclose hidden\npopulation trapping effects, and hence hidden constants of motion. Insofar as a\nspectator state simplifies the overall dynamics, its existence facilitates the\nderivation of analytic solutions and the design of recipes for quantum state\nengineering in the loop system. Moreover, it is shown that a suitable sequence\nof Householder transformations can cast an arbitrary N-dimensional hermitian\nHamiltonian into a tridiagonal form. The implication is that a general N-state\nsystem, with arbitrary linkage patterns where each state connects to any other\nstate, can be reduced to an equivalent chainwise-connected system, with\nnearest-neighbor interactions only, with ensuing possibilities for discovering\nhidden multidimensional spectator states and constants of motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2007 22:30:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-05-28"}

We propose that the\nsub-parsec-scale disk of massive stars orbiting the massive black hole at the\nGalactic center can be interpreted in terms of partial accretion of extended\nGalactic center clouds, such as the 50 \\kms molecular cloud, as these clouds\nenvelop Sgr A* on their passage through the inner Galactic center. The loss of\nangular momentum of the captured cloud material by self-interaction subsequent\nto gravitationally focusing by Sgr A* naturally creates a compact gaseous disk\nof material close to Sgr A* in which star formation takes place. On a larger\nscale the formation of massive clusters such as the Arches and Quintuplet\nclusters or on-going massive star formation such as Sgr B2 could also be\ntriggered by cloud-cloud collisions due to gravitational focusing in the deep\npotential of the central bulge.\n  Unlike the violent and high-pressure environment of clustered star formation\ntriggered by cloud-cloud collision, there are also isolated pockets of star\nformation and quiescent dense clouds.

This behavior is mainly\ncontrolled by the degenerate electron gas, which remains stable down to 5 MPM\ndue to high solvent polarizability and strong dielectric screening of solvated\nions. Comparing the behavior of the metallic state with those of localized\nsolvated electrons, we have estimated the miscibility gap $\\Delta n$ for\nvarious alkali metals and found $\\Delta n$(Na)$> \\Delta n($K$)$. It is rather\nnarrow in Rb-NH$_3$ and does not occur in Cs-NH$_3$ solutions, which is in full\nagreement with the experiments. The case of Li is discussed separately. The\ndifference calculated in the excess free energies of the metallic and\nnonmetallic phases is in the order of $k_BT$, yielding a thermally fluctuating\nmixed state at intermediate metal concentrations. It results in a continuous\nmetal-nonmetal (MNM) transition above the consolute point $T_c$ and a phase\nseparation below $T_c$. We propose a criterion for the MNM transition which may\nbe attributed to the line of the maximum of compressibility above $T_c$. This\nline crosses the spinodal one at the critical temperature. Finally, we assert\nthat a new electronic phase similar to microemulsion should also arise between\nthe spinodal and the binodal lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Dec 2007 14:09:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
