The method is based on the hypothesis that the Lya\nlines arise in the low to intermediate density intergalactic gas and that the\nJeans length is the typical size of the Lya absorbers. The reliability of FLO\nis tested against mock spectra obtained from cosmological simulations. The\nrecovering algorithm gives satisfactory results in the range from the mean\ndensity to over-densities of ~30 and reproduces correctly the correlation\nfunction of the density field and the 1D power spectrum on scales between ~20\nand 60 comoving Mpc. A sample of Lya forests from 22 high resolution QSO\nspectra is analysed, covering the redshift range 1.7<z<3.5. For each line of\nsight, we fit Voigt profiles to the lines of the Lya forest, providing the\nlargest, homogeneous sample of fitted Lya lines ever studied. The line number\ndensity evolution with redshift follows a power-law relation: dn/dz=(166 +/- 4)\n[(1+z)/3.5]^{(2.8 +/- 0.2)} (1 sigma errors). The two-point correlation\nfunction of lines shows a signal up to separations of ~2 comoving Mpc; weak\nlines (log N(HI)<13.8) also show a significant clustering but on smaller scales\n(r<1.5 comoving Mpc). We estimate with FLO the hydrogen density field toward\nthe 22 observed lines of sight. The redshift distribution of the average\ndensities computed for each QSO is consistent with the cosmic mean hydrogen\ndensity in the analysed redshift range. The two-point correlation function and\nthe 1D power spectrum of the delta field are estimated.

The paper is relatively self-contained, with\nbackground information about virtual knots and long virtual knots. We give\nnumerous examples applying the extended bracket, including a new proof of the\nnon-triviality of the Kishino diagram and the flat Kishino diagram and\nnon-classicality of single crossing virtualizations. The paper has a section on\nthe estimation of virtual crossing number using the extended bracket state sum.\nExamples are given of virtual knots with arbitrary minimal embedding genus and\narbitrarily high positive difference between the virtual crossing number and\nthe minimal embedding genus. A simplification of <<K>> is introduced and\ndenoted by A[K]. This simplified extended bracket, the arrow polynomial, is a\npolynomial in an infinite set of variables. It is quite strong (detecting the\nflat Kishino diagram for example) and easily computable.

We believe this conception could\nprovide the basis for a coherent understanding of several classes of natural\nphenomena that until now have been studied only in a piece-meal fashion. These\ninclude 1) the universal tendency for physical systems to associate together\ninto stable dynamic formations; 2) the seemingly unlimited capacity for\ngeneration of physical objects in Nature, including the emergence of coherent,\nquantized states in physical systems of the most varied nature; 3) the\nexistence of close couplings between processes whose characteristic\nlength-scales, frequency- and energy-ranges differ by many orders of magnitude.\nThe proposed conception first emerged in connection with experimental studies\nof the nonlinear behavior of coupled electromagnetic oscillators, and the\ndiscovery of two fundamental phenomena that had been overlooked in the\nclassical theory of oscillations. The essential features of these phenomena are\nsummarized in the first two sections of the paper, after which we indicate how\nthe underlying physical principles can be combined under a single notion of\ninteraction, providing a mechanism by which a practically unlimited wealth of\nphysical objects could be generated by the interaction of just a few. The final\nsection puts forward some preliminary ideas about the electromagneto-mechanical\ndual nature of physical objects as oscillatory processes, suggesting a\nuniversal scope for the proposed conceptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Dec 2007 14:53:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-12-18"}
