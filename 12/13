We employ a\nsimple color selection to identify high redshift galaxies with no dependence on\ngalaxy rest-frame optical color using Spitzer IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 micron\nphotometry. The majority (>90%) of galaxies with z > 1.3 are identified with\n[3.6] - [4.5] > -0.1 AB mag. We identify candidate galaxy clusters at z > 1 by\nselecting overdensities of >26-28 objects with [3.6] - [4.5] > -0.1 mag within\nradii of 1.4 arcminutes, which corresponds to r < 0.5 Mpc/h at z=1.5. These\ncandidate galaxy clusters show strong angular clustering, with an angular\ncorrelation function represented by w(theta) = (3.1 +/- 0.5) theta^(-1.1 +/-\n0.1) with theta in units of arcminutes over scales of 2-100 arcminutes.\nAssuming the redshift distribution of these galaxy clusters follows a fiducial\nmodel, these galaxy clusters have a spatial-clustering scale length r_0 = 22.4\n+/- 3.6 Mpc/h, and a comoving number density n = 1.2 +/- 0.1 x 10^-6\n(Mpc/h)^-3. The correlation scale length and number density of these objects\nare comparable to those of rich galaxy clusters at low redshift. The number\ndensity of these high-redshift clusters correspond to dark-matter halos larger\nthan 3-5 x 10^13 h^-1 solar masses at z=1.5. Assuming the dark halos hosting\nthese high-redshift clusters grow following Lambda-CDM models, these clusters\nwill reside in halos larger than 1-2 x 10^14 h^-1 solar masses at z=0.2,\ncomparable to rich galaxy clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2007 18:39:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The relational calculus augmented with polynomial constraints is the\nstandard first-order query language for constraint databases. Although the\nexpressive power of this query language has been studied extensively, the\ndifficulty of the efficient evaluation of queries, usually involving some form\nof quantifier elimination, has received considerably less attention. The\ninefficiency of existing quantifier-elimination software and the intrinsic\ndifficulty of quantifier elimination have proven to be a bottle-neck for for\nreal-world implementations of constraint database systems. In this paper, we\nfocus on a particular query, called the \\emph{alibi query}, that asks whether\ntwo moving objects whose positions are known at certain moments in time, could\nhave possibly met, given certain speed constraints. This query can be seen as a\nconstraint database query and its evaluation relies on the elimination of a\nblock of three existential quantifiers. Implementations of general purpose\nelimination algorithms are in the specific case, for practical purposes, too\nslow in answering the alibi query and fail completely in the parametric case.\nThe main contribution of this paper is an analytical solution to the parametric\nalibi query, which can be used to answer this query in the specific case in\nconstant time. We also give an analytic solution to the alibi query at a fixed\nmoment in time. The solutions we propose are based on geometric argumentation\nand they illustrate the fact that some practical problems require creative\nsolutions, where at least in theory, existing systems could provide a solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2007 18:05:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-12-13"}

The \"super-supernova\" or\nGRB blast wave model for the formation of Constellation III is difficult to\nreconcile with such an extended, two-epoch star formation history, because the\nshock wave should have induced star formation throughout the structure\nsimultaneously, and any unconsumed gas would quickly be dissipated, leaving\nnothing from which to form a subsequent burst of activity. We propose a \"truly\nstochastic\" self-propagating star formation model, distinct from the canonical\nmodel in which star formation proceeds in a radially-directed wave from the\ncenter of Constellation III to its perimeter. As others have noted, and we now\nconfirm, the bulk age gradients demanded by such a model are simply not present\nin Constellation III. In our scenario, the prestellar gas is somehow pushed\ninto these large-scale arc structures, without simultaneously triggering\nimmediate and violent star formation throughout the structure. Rather, star\nformation proceeds in the arc according to the local physical conditions of the\ngas. Self-propagating star formation is certainly possible, but in a truly\nstochastic manner, without a directed, large scale pattern.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2007 01:40:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2008 18:17:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We also study\nquasihole excitations and edge excitations in the Moore-Read--like state. From\nthe evolution of edge spectrum, we obtain the velocities of the charge and\nneutral edge modes, which turn out to be very different. This separation of\nvelocities is a source of decoherence for a non-Abelian quasihole/quasiparticle\n(with charge $\\pm e/4$) when propagating at the edge; using numbers obtained\nfrom a specific set of parameters we estimate the decoherence length to be\naround four microns. This sets an upper bound for the separation of the two\npoint contacts in a double point contact interferometer, designed to detect the\nnon-Abelian nature of such quasiparticles. We also find a state that is a\npotential candidate for the recently proposed anti-Pfaffian state. We find the\nspeculated anti-Pfaffian state is favored in weak confinement (smooth edge)\nwhile the Moore-Read Pfaffian state is favored in strong confinement (sharp\nedge).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2007 05:23:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2008 12:35:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 29 May 2008 14:50:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Eight stars in our sample: BY Dra, VY Ari, V775 Her, II Peg,\nV1149 Ori, HU Vir, EI Eri and DH Leo become redder when they get fainter. The\nother six stars show the opposite behaviour, i.e. they become bluer when they\nget fainter. For V711 Tau this behaviour could be explained by the increased\nrelative U- and B- flux contribution by the earlier-type component of the\nbinary system when the cooler component gets fainter. On the other hand, for AR\nPsc, UX Ari, RS CVn, SZ Psc and AR Lac the existence of hot photospheric\nfaculae must be necessarily invoked. We also found that in single-lined and\ndouble-lined binary stars in which the fainter component is inactive or much\nless active the V magnitude is correlated to B-V and U-B color variations in\nmore than 60% of observation seasons. The correlation is found in less than 40%\nof observation seasons when the fainter component has a non-negligible level of\nactivity and/or hot faculae are present but they are either spatially or\ntemporally uncorrelated to spots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2007 10:44:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Six such events have been recorded so far. During\nquiescence states of the system, i.e. in time intervals between outbursts, the\nLC is clearly modulated by a stable coherent period of P2=759.1 d.

A third coherent period of P3=658.4 d is modulating the\nintense fluctuations in the optical brightness of the system during outbursts.\nWe attribute the trigger of the outbursts phenomenon and the clock that drives\nit, to a solar type magnetic dynamo cycle that operates in the convection and\nthe outer layers of the giant star of the system.

The\nresults show that a mutual interaction takes place between the two species in\nthe solid, which alters the band positions and band strengths. It is found that\nthe band strengths of the H2O bulk stretch, bending and libration vibrational\nbands decrease linearly by a factor of up to 2 when the CO concentration is\nincreased from 0 to 80%. By contrast, the band strength of the free OH stretch\nincreases linearly. The results are compared to a recently performed\nquantitative study on H2O:CO2 ice mixtures. It is shown that for mixing ratios\nof 1:0.5 H2O:X and higher, the H2O bending mode offers a good tracer to\ndistinguish between CO2 or CO in H2O ice. Additionally, it is found that the\nband strength of the CO fundamental remains constant when the water\nconcentration is increased in the ice. The integrated absorbance of the 2152\ncm-1 CO feature, with respect to the total integrated CO absorption feature, is\nfound to be a good indicator of the degree of mixing of CO in the H2O:CO\nlaboratory ice system. From the change in the H2O absorption band strength in\nlaboratory ices upon mixing we conclude that astronomical water ice column\ndensities on various lines of sight can be underestimated by up to 25% if\nsignificant amounts of CO and CO2 are mixed in.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2007 12:54:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-25"}

This paper\ndevelops a new method for proving limits of nonlocal strategies that make use\nof prior entanglement among players (or, provers, in the terminology of\nmulti-prover interactive proofs). Instead of proving the limits for usual\nisolated provers who initially share entanglement, this paper proves the limits\nfor \"commuting-operator provers\", who share private space, but can apply only\nsuch operators that are commutative with any operator applied by other provers.\nCommuting-operator provers are at least as powerful as usual isolated but\nprior-entangled provers, and thus, limits for commuting-operator provers\nimmediately give limits for usual entangled provers. Using this method, we\nobtain an n-party generalization of the Tsirelson bound for the Clauser-Horne-\nShimony-Holt inequality for every n. Our bounds are tight in the sense that, in\nevery n-party case, the equality is achievable by a usual nonlocal strategy\nwith prior entanglement. We also apply our method to a 3-prover 1-round binary\ninteractive proof for NEXP. Combined with the technique developed by Kempe,\nKobayashi, Matsumoto, Toner and Vidick to analyze the soundness of the proof\nsystem, it is proved to be NP-hard to distinguish whether the entangled value\nof a 3-prover 1-round binary-answer game is equal to 1 or at most 1-1/p(n) for\nsome polynomial p, where n is the number of questions. This is in contrast to\nthe 2-prover 1-round binary-answer case, where the corresponding problem is\nefficiently decidable.
