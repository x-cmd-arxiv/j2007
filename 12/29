In this formalism, the physical laws\nthemselves are resonantly-selected and ordered in the universe cavity in a\nhierarchical manner, and the values of fundamental constants are determined\nthrough a Generalized Mach's Principle. The existence of a preferred reference\nframe in this scenario is shown to be consistent with the relational nature of\nthe origin of physical laws. Covariant unitary evolution is shown to connect\nsmoothly with the reduction of wavefunction in the preferred frame during\nquantum measurement.

A natural quantum-to-classical transition is also obtained which\nis stable against the diffusive tendency of the unitary quantum evolution\nprocesses.

These vary with regard to the assumption of what quantity is penalized.\nThe possibilities considered are the rate of evolution, the log of the rate of\nevolution and the inverse of the rate of evolution. These models also vary with\nregard to how time affects the expected variance of rate change. Here the\nalternatives are not at all, linearly with time and as the product of rate and\ntime. This results in a set of nine models, both random walks and Brownian\nmotion. A priori any of these models could be correct, yet different\nresearchers may well prefer, or simply use, one rather than the others. Another\nvariable is whether to use a scaling factor to take account of the variance of\nthe process of rate change being unknown and therefore avoid minimizing the\npenalty function with unrealistically large times.

In neuronal networks, the\nmechanisms of synchronization have been extensively studied from both\nphysiological and computational viewpoints. The functional role of\nsynchronization has also attracted much interest and debate. In particular,\nsynchronization may allow distant sites in the brain to communicate and\ncooperate with each other, and therefore it may play a role in temporal binding\nand in attention and sensory-motor integration mechanisms.\n  In this article, we study another role for synchronization: the so-called\n\"collective enhancement of precision.\" We argue, in a full nonlinear dynamical\ncontext, that synchronization may help protect interconnected neurons from the\ninfluence of random perturbations -- intrinsic neuronal noise -- which affect\nall neurons in the nervous system. This property may allow reliable\ncomputations to be carried out even in the presence of significant noise (as\nexperimentally found e.g., in retinal ganglion cells in primates), as\nmathematically it is key to obtaining meaningful downstream signals, whether in\nterms of precisely-timed interaction (temporal coding), population coding, or\nfrequency coding. Using stochastic contraction theory, we show how\nsynchronization of nonlinear dynamical systems helps protect these systems from\nrandom perturbations.\n  Our main contribution is a mathematical proof that, under specific quantified\nconditions, the impact of noise on each individual system and on the spatial\nmean can essentially be cancelled through synchronization. Similar concepts may\nbe applicable to questions in systems biology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Dec 2007 22:28:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Apr 2008 16:37:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 Nov 2008 20:56:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2009 04:47:34 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2009 06:07:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-18"}

Whereas some lines of excited states of OH have been\ndetected and studied in star forming regions, the subject of excited-state OH\nin supernova remnants -- where high collision rates are to be expected -- is\nonly recently being addressed. Modeling of collisional excitation of OH\ndemonstrates that 1720, 4765 and 6049 MHz masers can occur under similar\nconditions in regions of shocked gas. In particular, the 6049 and 4765 MHz\nmasers become more significant at increased OH column densities where the 1720\nMHz masers begin to be quenched. In supernova remnants, the detection of\nexcited-state OH line maser emission could therefore serve as a probe of\nregions of higher column densities. Using the Very Large Array, we searched for\nexcited-state OH in the 4.7, 7.8, 8.2 and 23.8 GHz lines in four well studied\nsupernova remnants with strong 1720 MHz maser emission (SgrAEast, W28, W44 and\nIC443).

The novel test was applied to the problem of detecting the\nmyelin signal, which is believed to have a time constant below 40ms, in T2\ndecays from MRI's of the human brain. It was demonstrated that the test allowed\nthe detection of a signal in a relaxation spectrum using only the information\nin the data, thus avoiding any potentially unreliable prior information. The\ntest was implemented both explicitly and implicitly for simulated T2\nmeasurements. For the explicit implementation, the null hypothesis was that a\nrelaxation spectrum existed that had no signal below 40ms and that was\nconsistent with the T2 decay. The confidence level by which the null hypothesis\ncould be rejected gave the confidence level that there was signal below the\n40ms time constant. The explicit implementation assessed the test's performance\nwith and without prior information where the prior information was the\nnonnegative relaxation spectrum assumption. The test was also implemented\nimplicitly with a data conserving multiexponential reconstruction algorithm\nthat used left invertible matrices and that has been published previously. The\nimplicit and explicit implementations demonstrated similar characteristics in\ndetecting the myelin signal in both the simulated and experimental T2 decays,\nproviding additional evidence to support the close link between the two tests.\n[Full abstract in paper]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Dec 2007 10:58:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Jun 2008 09:10:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Namely,\nthe tau functions of two different BKP hierarchies provide generating functions\nrespectively (I) for transition weights between different particle\nconfigurations and (II) for an important object: a normalization function which\nplays the role of the statistical sum for our non-equilibrium system. As an\nexample we study a model where the hopping rate depends on two parameters ($r$\nand $\\beta$). For time $\\time\\to\\infty$ we obtain the asymptotic configuration\nof particles obtained from the initial empty state (the state without\nparticles) and find an analog of the first order transition at $\\beta=1$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Dec 2007 14:19:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-03"}

This is done by\nintroducing an additional topological term in the action which becomes a\nLorentz-violating term by virtue of the dependence of the coupling on the\nspace-time point. We obtain a condition on the solutions of the Einstein\nequations, such that they persist in the deformed theory, and show that the\nsolutions remarkably correspond to the classical solutions of a collection of\nindependent 2+1-d (topological) Chern-Simons gravities. Finally, we study the\nrelation with the standard second-order approach and argue that they both\ncoincide to leading order in the modulus of the Lorentz-violating vector field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Dec 2007 14:27:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Apr 2008 13:01:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 May 2008 14:43:24 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 18 Jul 2008 16:25:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
