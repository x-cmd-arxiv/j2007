Zhao and\nBau (Langmuir, \\textbf{23}, 2007, pp 4053) recently predicted that a metal\n(ideally polarizable) cylinder is repelled from an insulating wall in a DC\nfield. We revisit this problem with an AC field and show that attraction to the\nwall sets in at high frequency and leads to an equilibrium distance, where DEP\nbalances ICEP, although, in three dimensions, a metal sphere is repelled from\nthe wall at all frequencies. This conclusion, however, does not apply to\nasymmetric particles. Consistent with the recent experiments of Gangwal et al.\n(arXiv:0708.2417), we show that a metal/insulator Janus particle is always\nattracted to the wall in an AC field. The Janus particle tends to move toward\nits insulating end, perpendicular to the field, but ICEP torque rotates this\nend toward the wall. Under some conditions, the theory predicts steady\ntranslation along the wall with an equilibrium tilt angle, as seen in\nexperiments, although more detailed modeling of the contact region of\noverlapping double layers is required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2007 18:08:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-12-05"}

These observations have allowed us to derive an updated version of the\npower law describing the correlation between the FIR luminosity (L_FIR) and the\nHCN(1-0) luminosity (L'_HCN(1-0)) of local and high-redshift galaxies. We\npresent the first clear observational evidence that the star formation\nefficiency of the dense gas (SFE_dense), measured as the L_FIR/L'_HCN(1-0)\nratio, is significantly higher in LIRGs and ULIRGs than in normal galaxies, a\nresult that has also been found recently in high-redshift galaxies. This may\nimply a statistically significant turn upward in the Kennicutt-Schmidt law\nderived for the dense gas at L_FIR >= 10^11 L_sun.

An overabundance of HCN at high L_FIR implies that the\nreported trend in the L_FIR/L'_HCN ratio as a function of L_FIR would be\nunderestimating a potentially more dramatic change of the SFE_dense.

Although numerous individual stars\nhave been observed in high-resolution, realizing the full scientific potential\nof these observations will necessitate studying the high-resolution Chandra\ndataset as a whole. To facilitate the rapid comparison and characterization of\nstellar spectra, we have compiled a uniformly processed database of all stars\nobserved with the Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating (HETG). This\ndatabase, known as X-Atlas, is accessible through a web interface with\nsearching, data retrieval, and interactive plotting capabilities. For each\ntarget, X-Atlas also features predictions of the low-resolution ACIS spectra\nconvolved from the HETG data for comparison with stellar sources in archival\nACIS images. Preliminary analyses of the hardness ratios, quantiles, and\nspectral fits derived from the predicted ACIS spectra reveal systematic\ndifferences between the high-mass and low-mass stars in the atlas and offer\nevidence for at least two distinct classes of high-mass stars. A high degree of\nX-ray variability is also seen in both high and low-mass stars, including\nCapella, long thought to exhibit minimal variability. X-Atlas contains over 130\nobservations of approximately 25 high-mass stars and 40 low-mass stars and will\nbe updated as additional stellar HETG observations become public.

A causal effect defined on the\nbasis of such a static treatment intervention can only be identified from\nobserved data if all subjects in the target population have a positive\nprobability of selecting each of the candidate treatment options, an assumption\nthat is highly unrealistic in this case since subjects with serious health\nproblems will not be able to engage in higher levels of vigorous physical\nactivity.

In this paper, we focus on the properties\nof the galaxies' tails of stripped gas. The galactic wakes show a flaring\nwidth, where the flaring angle depends on the gas disc's cross-section with\nrespect to the galaxy's direction of motion. The velocity in the wakes shows a\nsignificant turbulent component of a few 100 km/s. The stripped gas is\ndeposited in the cluster rather locally, i.e. within ~150 kpc from where it was\nstripped. We demonstrate that the most important quantity governing the tail\ndensity, length and gas mass distribution along the orbit is the galaxy's mass\nloss per orbital length. This in turn depends on the ram pressure as well as\nthe galaxy's orbital velocity. For a sensitivity limit of ~10^19 cm^-2 in\nprojected gas density, we find typical tail lengths of 40 kpc. Such long tails\nare seen even at large distances (0.5 to 1 Mpc) from the cluster centre. At\nthis sensitivity limit, the tails show little flaring, but a width similar to\nthe gas disc's size. Morphologically, we find good agreement with the HI tails\nobserved in the Virgo cluster by Chung et al. (2007). However, the observed\ntails show a much smaller velocity width than predicted from the simulation.\nThe few known X-ray and H$\\alpha$ tails are generally much narrower and much\nstraighter than the tails in our simulations. Thus, additional physics like a\nviscous ICM, the influence of cooling and tidal effects may be needed to\nexplain the details of the observations. We discuss the hydrodynamical drag as\na heat source for the ICM but conclude that it is not likely to play an\nimportant role, especially not in stopping cooling flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2007 09:37:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 May 2008 08:11:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In\nparticular, we consider the well-studied sample of 15 field elliptical galaxies\nselected from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) Survey (z = 0.06-0.33). We examine\nhere the correlation between the stellar mass values, enclosed inside the\nEinstein radius of each lens, based on analyses of lensing and stellar dynamics\ncombined and based on multiwavelength photometry spectral template fitting. The\nlensing+dynamics stellar mass is obtained from the published SLACS Survey\nresults, assuming a two-component density distribution model and a prior from\nthe fundamental plane on the mass-to-light ratio for the lens galaxies. The\nphotometric stellar mass is measured by fitting the observed spectral energy\ndistribution of the galaxies (from the SDSS multi-band photometry over 354-913\nnm) with composite stellar population templates, under the assumption that\nlight traces stellar mass. The two methods are completely independent. They\nrely on several different assumptions, and so, in principle, both can have\nsignificant biases. Based on our sample of massive galaxies, we find\nconsistency between the lensing+dynamics and the photometric mass estimates. We\nobtain a Pearson linear correlation coefficient of 0.94 and a median value of\nthe ratio between the former and the latter mass measurements of 1.1+/-0.1.\nThis suggests that both methods can separately yield reliable stellar masses of\nearly-type galaxies, and confirms that photometric mass estimates are accurate,\nas long as optical/near-IR rest frame photometry is available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2007 10:34:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The steadiness of the emission has prompted many to\nsuggest that the heating in these loops must also be steady, though no direct\ncomparison between the observed X-ray and EUV intensities and the steady\nheating solutions of the hydrodynamic equations has yet been made. In this\npaper, we perform these simulations and simultaneously model the X-Ray and EUV\nmoss intensities in one active regioncore with steady uniform heating. To\nperform this task, we introduce a new technique to constrain the model\nparameters using the measured EUV footpoint intensity to infer a heating rate.\nWe find that a filling factor of 8% and loops that expand with height provides\nthe best agreement with the intensity in two X-ray filters, though the\nsimulated SXT Al12 intensity is 147% the observed intensity and the SXT AlMg\nintensity is 80% the observed intensity. From this solution, we determine the\nrequired heating rate scales as ${\\bar{B}}^{0.29} L^{-0.95}$. Finally we\ndiscuss the future potential of this type of modeling, such as the ability to\nuse density measurements to fully constrain filling factor, and its\nshortcomings, such as the requirement to use potential field extrapolations to\napproximate the coronal field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2007 15:52:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Any steady-state vortex\ngyrotropic motions driven by a linearly polarized oscillating in-plane magnetic\nfield in the linear regime can be perfectly understood according to the\nsuperposition of the two circular eigenmodes, which show asymmetric resonance\ncharacteristics reflecting the vortex polarization. The relative magnitudes in\nthe amplitude and phase between the CCW and CW eigenmodes determine the\nelongation and orientation of the orbital trajectories of the vortex core\nmotions, respectively, which trajectories vary with the polarization and\nchirality of the given vortex as well as the field frequency across the\nresonance frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2007 15:56:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2008 11:57:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2008 14:47:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-05"}
