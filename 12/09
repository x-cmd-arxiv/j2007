Analysis of archival Chandra\ndata and new NRAO Very Large Array data shows that each galaxy contains a\nlow-luminosity active galactic nucleus (LLAGN), identified as a faint, hard\nX-ray source that is astrometrically coincident with a faint 8.5-GHz source.\nThe latter has a diameter less than 0.3 arcsec (26 pc for NGC 4621, 17 pc for\nNGC 4697). The black holes energizing these LLAGNs have Eddington ratios L(2-10\nkeV) / L(Edd) ~ 1e-9, placing them in the so-called quiescent regime. The\nemission from these quiescent black holes is radio-loud, with log Rx = log\nnuLnu(8.5 GHz) / L(2-10 keV) ~ -2, suggesting the presence of a radio outflow.\nAlso, application of the radio-X-ray-mass relation from Yuan & Cui for\nquiescent black holes predicts the observed radio luminosities nuLnu(8.5 GHz)\nto within a factor of a few. Significantly, that relation invokes X-ray\nemission from the outflow rather than from an accretion flow. The faint, but\ndetectable, emission from these two massive black holes is therefore consistent\nwith being outflow-dominated. Observational tests of this finding are\nsuggested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Dec 2007 21:37:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

There is however a significant scatter between these two quantities\nwhose origin is uncertain. We show in this paper that this scatter is at least\npartially the result of galaxy merging, revealing that disk galaxy growth at z\n< 1 is fundamentally hierarchical. We carry this out by calculating CAS\n(concentration, asymmetry, clumpiness) structural parameters using archival\nHubble Space Telescope imaging of 91 high-redshift disk galaxies at 0.4 < z <\n1.0 with robustly measured stellar masses and rotational maximum velocities\ntaken from Conselice et al.

We find a significant (> 3 sigma)\ncorrelation between the residuals from the stellar-mass Tully-Fisher relation\nin both the M_* and V_max directions, and high asymmetries. This result holds\nafter we remove contributions from star formation and edge-on galaxies which\ncan produce higher asymmetries unrelated to merging. While there are a few\ncases in which our disk galaxies have very large asymmetries, and are\npotentially involved in major mergers, in general these asymmetries are smaller\nthan the major merger limit. It is therefore likely that these galaxies are\nforming hierarchically through minor galaxy mergers, which is also suggested by\nthe constant slope and zero point of the stellar mass Tully-Fisher relation\nduring the same epoch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Dec 2007 00:21:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-12-11"}

In\nthe limit $n \\to \\infty$, after appropriate rescaling, the paths fill out a\nregion in the $tx$-plane that we describe explicitly. In particular, the paths\ninitially stay away from the hard edge at $x = 0$, but at a certain critical\ntime $t^*$ the smallest paths hit the hard edge and from then on are stuck to\nit. For $t \\neq t^*$ we obtain the usual scaling limits from random matrix\ntheory, namely the sine, Airy, and Bessel kernels. A key fact is that the\npositions of the paths at any time $t$ constitute a multiple orthogonal\npolynomial ensemble, corresponding to a system of two modified Bessel-type\nweights. As a consequence, there is a $3 \\times 3$ matrix valued\nRiemann-Hilbert problem characterizing this model, that we analyze in the large\n$n$ limit using the Deift-Zhou steepest descent method. There are some novel\ningredients in the Riemann-Hilbert analysis that are of independent interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Dec 2007 10:26:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Frequency analysis of the\nspectroscopic data gives four frequencies. Three highest amplitude frequencies\nin spectroscopy coincide with the photometric ones. Phase-amplitude diagrams\ncreated for the lines of different elements/ions show that atmospheric\npulsations may be represented by a superposition of the standing and running\nwave components, similar to other roAp stars. The highest RV amplitudes,\n300-400 m/s, were measured for Ce II, Dy III, Tb III, and two unidentified\nlines at lambda 5471, 5556 A. We discovered ~0.4 period phase jump in the RV\nmeasurements across the Nd III line profiles. It indicates the presence of the\npulsation node in stellar atmosphere.
