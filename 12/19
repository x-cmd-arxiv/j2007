In\nthis paper, we expand on this proposal, examine how well its predictions agree\nwith current simulations, and discuss several future directions that would make\nit an even more valuable tool. The spin expansion yields many new predictions,\nincluding several exact results that may be useful for testing numerical codes.\nSome of these predictions have already been confirmed, while others await\nfuture simulations. We explain how a relatively small number of simulations --\n10 equal-mass simulations, and 16 unequal-mass simulations -- may be used to\ncalibrate all of the coefficients in the spin expansion up to second order at\nthe minimum computational cost. For a more general set of simulations of given\ncovariance, we derive the minimum-variance unbiased estimators for the spin\nexpansion coefficients.

However, as long as the ontological status of subjectivity itself\nremains unresolved, the topic will be seen as more within the purview of\nphilosophy than of physics. Towards a resolution of this issue within\nempirically motivated physical theory, this article introduces an operational\ndefinition that ultilizes the general consensus that subjective mental states,\nwhatever else is controversial about them, at least correlate in some way to\nphysical states. It is shown here that implementing this underappreciated\nassumption within the framework of a physical theory in fact leads to\nwide-ranging consequences. In particular, a correlation requires there exist a\nwell-defined mapping from a space of subjective mental states onto a space of\ninformation-bearing elements of some physical theory. Given the peculiar nature\nof subjective states as inherently private appearances, any empirical\nidentification of states must be performed by the experiencing subject. It is\nargued that such an operationally defined 'self-measuring' act leads\nunavoidably to an 'uncertainty principle' that is analogous in some intriguing\nways to Heisenberg's principle for quantum mechanics. A model is then\nintroduced for subjective states as algorithmically incomputable numbers.\nAdditionaally, an inequality similar to Bell's theorem may be derived,\nindicating an analogy with the violations of local reality and the ontology of\nobservables within quantum mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2007 17:15:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-12-19"}

Before the shock hits the density step (t ~\n150 ms), the survival probability of electron neutrinos is about 0.68, in\ncontrast to values of 0.32 or less for an iron core supernova. The passage of\nthe shock through the step and its subsequent propagation cause a decrease of\nthe survival probability and a decrease of the amplitude of oscillations in the\nEarth, reflecting the transition to a more adiabatic propagation inside the\nstar. These changes affect the lower energy neutrinos first; they are faster\nand more sizable for larger theta_13. They are unique of ONeMg-core supernovae,\nand give the possibility to test the speed of the shock wave. The time\nmodulation of the Earth effect and its negative sign at the neutronization peak\nare the most robust signatures in a detector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2007 20:43:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2007 21:07:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Jun 2008 21:45:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-06"}

This\nproblem was first suggested by Aharonov. We show that it is QMA-complete, via\nan oracle reduction from Local Hamiltonian. This uses algorithms for convex\noptimization with a membership oracle, due to Yudin and Nemirovskii.\n  Next we show that two problems from quantum chemistry, ``Fermionic Local\nHamiltonian'' and ``N-representability,'' are QMA-complete. These problems\narise in calculating the ground state energies of molecular systems.\nN-representability is a key component in recently developed numerical methods\nusing the contracted Schrodinger equation. Although these problems have been\nstudied since the 1960's, it is only recently that the theory of quantum\ncomputation has allowed us to properly characterize their complexity.\n  Finally, we study some special cases of the Consistency problem, pertaining\nto 1-dimensional and ``stoquastic'' systems.

In\nparticular, we establish that the Gibbs sampler converges at a geometric rate.\nThis allows us to establish conditions for a central limit theorem for the\nergodic averages used to estimate features of the posterior. Geometric\nergodicity is also a key component for using batch means methods to\nconsistently estimate the variance of the asymptotic normal distribution.\nTogether, our results give practitioners the tools to be as confident in\ninferences based on the observations from the Gibbs sampler as they would be\nwith inferences based on random samples from the posterior. Our theoretical\nresults are illustrated with an application to data on the cost of health plans\nissued by health maintenance organizations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2007 21:12:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 May 2008 15:10:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Oct 2008 16:37:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 17 Oct 2009 19:53:46 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2010 23:04:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-22"}

The AGN are selected such that their rest-frame UV\nto near-IR SEDs are dominated by stellar emission, i.e., they show a prominent\n1.6micron bump, thus minimizing the AGN emission 'contamination'. This AGN\npopulation comprises approximately 50% of the X-ray selected AGN at these\nredshifts. Using models of stellar and dust emission we model their SEDs to\nderive stellar masses (M*) and total (UV+IR) star formation rates (SFR). AGN\nreside in the most massive galaxies at the redshifts probed here. Their\ncharacteristic stellar masses (M*~7.8x10^10 Msun and M*~1.2x10^11 Msun at\nmedian z of 0.67 and 1.07, respectively) appear to be representative of the\nX-ray selected AGN population at these redshifts, and are intermediate between\nthose of local type 2 AGN and high redshift (z~2) AGN. The inferred black hole\nmasses (MBH~ 2x10^8 Msun) of typical AGN are similar to those of optically\nidentified quasars at similar redshifts. Since the AGN in our sample are much\nless luminous (L(2-10keV)<10^44 erg/s) than quasars, typical AGN have low\nEddington ratios (eta~0.01-0.001). This suggests that, at least at intermediate\nz, the cosmic AGN 'downsizing' is due to both a decrease in the characteristic\nstellar mass of typical host galaxies, and less efficient accretion. Finally\nthere is no strong evidence in AGN host galaxies for either highly suppressed\nSF (expected if AGN played a role in quenching SF) or elevated SF when compared\nto mass selected (i.e., IRAC-selected) galaxies of similar stellar masses and\nredshifts. This may be explained by the fact that galaxies with M*~5x 10^10 -\n5x10^11 Msun are still being assembled at the redshifts probed here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2007 08:47:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The GEM experiment uses a portable and\ndouble-shielded 5.5-m radiotelescope in altazimuthal configuration to map\n60-degree-wide declination bands from different observational sites by\ncircularly scanning the sky at zenithal angles of 30 deg from a constantly\nrotating platform. The observations were accomplished with a total power\nreceiver, whose front-end High Electron Mobility Transistor (HEMT) amplifier\nwas matched directly to a cylindrical horn at the prime focus of the parabolic\nreflector. The Moon was used to calibrate the antenna temperature scale and the\npreparation of the map required direct subtraction and destriping algorithms to\nremove ground contamination as the most significant source of systematic error.\nWe used 484 hours of total intensity observations from two locations in\nColombia and Brazil to yield 66% sky coverage from DEC = -51.73 deg to DEC =\n+34.78 deg. The zero-level uncertainty of the combined survey is 103 mK with a\ntemperature scale error of 5% after direct correlation with the Rhodes/HartRAO\nsurvey at 2326 MHz on a T-T plot. The sky brightness distribution into regions\nof low and high emission in the GEM survey is consistent with the appearance of\na transition region as seen in the Haslam 408 MHz and WMAP K-band surveys.\nPreliminary results also show that the temperature spectral index between 408\nMHz and the 2.3 GHz band of the GEM survey has a weak spatial correlation with\nthese regions; but it steepens significantly from high to low emission regions\nwith respect to the WMAP K-band survey.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2007 10:06:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Jul 2013 04:52:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

A roughly 3' by 5', double-peaked region in the north center is\nfound to be highly enriched in Si and other elements relative to the rest of\nthe remnant. The X-ray fitted abundances are otherwise well below the solar\nvalues. While the ejecta-enhanced regions show some variation of relative\nelement abundances, there is little evidence for a very strong enhancement of\none element over the others in the imaged portion of the remnant, except\npossibly for a region of O and Ne enhancement in the remnant's south center.\nThere is no spatial correlation between the compact [O III] emitting ejecta\nknots seen optically and the abundance enhancements seen in X-rays, although\nthey are located in the same vicinity. The map of fitted column density shows\nstrong variations across the remnant that echo earlier X-ray spectral hardness\nmaps. The ionization age (as fitted for single temperature models) is sharply\nhigher in a ridge behind the northeast-east boundary of the remnant, and is\nprobably related to the strong molecular cloud interaction along that boundary.\nThe temperature map, by comparison, shows relatively weak variations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2007 15:21:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We find that if in addition to dc bias a strong THz pump\nfield is applied, Bloch gain profile for a small THz signal can be achieved\nunder conditions of positive static differential conductivity. Here the\npositive differential conductivity arises, similarly to the case of\nlarge-signal amplification scheme [H. Kroemer, cond-mat/0009311)], due to\nmodifications of dc current density caused by the application of high-frequency\nac field [K. Unterrainer \\textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{76}, 2973\n(1996)]. Whereas the sign of absorption at low and zero frequencies is\nsensitive to the ac fields, the gain profile in the vicinity of gain maximum is\nrobust. We suggest to use this ac-induced effect in a starter for THz Bloch\noscillator. Our analysis demonstrates that the application of a short THz pulse\nto a superlattice allows to suppress the undesirable formation of electric\ndomains and reach a sustained large-amplitude operation of the dc-biased Bloch\nscillator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2007 15:37:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Its X-ray spectrum is thermal, and is reproduced remarkably well by a\nblack-body, but its interpretation has remained puzzling. One reason is that\nthe source did not exhibit pulsations, and hence a magnetic field\nstrength--vital input to atmosphere models--could not be estimated. Recently,\nhowever, very weak pulsations were discovered. Here, we analyze these in\ndetail, using all available data from the XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray\nobservatories. From frequency measurements, we set a 2-sigma upper limit to the\nfrequency derivative of \\dot\\nu<1.3e-14 Hz/s. Trying possible phase-connected\ntiming solutions, we find that one solution is far more likely than the others,\nand we infer a most probable value of \\dot\\nu=(-5.98+/-0.14)e-16 Hz/s. The\ninferred magnetic field strength is 1.5e13 G, comparable to what was found for\nsimilar neutron stars. From models, the field seems too strong to be consistent\nwith the absence of spectral features for non-condensed atmospheres. It is\nsufficiently strong, however, that the surface could be condensed, but only if\nit is consists of heavy elements like iron. Our measurements imply a\ncharacteristic age of about 4 Myr. This is longer than the cooling and\nkinematic ages, as was found for similar objects, but at almost a factor ten,\nthe discrepancy is more extreme. A puzzle raised by our measurement is that the\nimplied rotational energy loss rate of about 3e30 erg/s is orders of magnitude\nsmaller than what was inferred from the H-alpha nebula surrounding the source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2007 15:57:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-30"}
