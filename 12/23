Similarly, in three\ndimensions the addition of two Maxwell-Chern-Simons fields of opposite\nhelicities $\\pm 1$ will not produce a parity invariant Maxwell-Proca theory. An\ninterference term between the opposite chiralities (helicities) states is\nrequired in order to obtain the expected result. The so called soldering\nprocedure provides the missing interference Lagrangian in both 2D and 3D cases.\nIn two dimensions such interference term allows to fuse two chiral fermionic\ndeterminants into a nonchiral one. In a recent work we have generalized this\nprocedure by allowing the appearance of an extra parameter which takes two\npossible values and leads to two different soldered Lagrangians. Here we apply\nthis generalized soldering in a bosonic theory which has appeared in a partial\nbosonization of the 3D gauged Thirring with $N$ flavors. The multiplicity of\nflavors allow new types of solderings and help us to understand the connection\nbetween different perturbative approaches to bosonization in 3D. In particular,\nwe obtain an interference term which takes us from a multiflavor\nMaxwell-Chern-Simons theory to a pair of self-dual and anti-self-dual theories\nwhen we combine together both fermionic determinants of +1/2 and -1/2 helicity\nfermions. An important role is played by a set of pure non-interacting\nChern-Simons fields which amount to a normalization factor in the fermionic\ndeterminants and act like spectators in the original theory but play an active\nrole in the soldering procedure.

In this paper, our purpose is first to present another derivation\nof this result and then to introduce a generalization to non-equidimensional\nvarities. For the sake of clarity, we shall reformulate our first problem as\nfollows. Let $Z$ be an equidimensional variety (maybe singular and/or\nreducible) of dimension $n$, other than a linear space, embedded into $\\PP^r$,\n$r \\geq n+1$. The variety of trisecant lines of $Z$, say $V_{1,3}(Z)$, has\ndimension strictly less than $2n$, unless $Z$ is included in a\n$(n+1)-$dimensional linear space and has degree at least 3, in which case\n$\\dim(V_{1,3}(Z)) = 2n$. Then we inquire the more general case, where $Z$ is\nnot required to be equidimensional. In that case, let $Z$ be a possibly\nsingular variety of dimension $n$, that may be neither irreducible nor\nequidimensional, embedded into $\\PP^r$, where $r \\geq n+1$, and $Y$ a proper\nsubvariety of dimension $k \\geq 1$.

We show that $S$ has dimension\nstrictly less than $n+k$, unless the union of lines in $S$ has dimension $n+1$,\nin which case $dim(S) = n+k$. In the latter case, if the dimension of the space\nis stricly greater then $n+1$, the union of lines in $S$ cannot cover the whole\nspace. This is the main result of our work. We also introduce some examples\nshowing than our bound is strict.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Dec 2007 20:27:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-05"}

The proximity of its mass to the D_1 D-bar^* threshold has\nmotivated the interpretation of the Z^+ as a charm meson molecule whose\nconstituents are an S-wave superposition of D_1^+ D-bar^{*0}$ and D^{*+}\nD-bar_1^0$. If this interpretation is correct, the small ratio of the binding\nenergy of the Z^+ to the width Gamma_1 of its constituent D_1 can be exploited\nto predict properties of its line shapes. Its full width at half maximum in the\nchannel psi' pi^+ should be approximately sqrt{3} Gamma_1 = 35 MeV, which is\nconsistent with the measured width of the Z^+. The Z^+ should also decay into\nD^* D-bar^* pi through decay of its constituent D_1. The peak in the line shape\nfor D^* D-bar^* pi should be at a higher energy than the peak in the line shape\nfor psi' pi^+ by about Gamma_1/sqrt{12} = 6 MeV. The line shape in D^* D-bar^*\npi should also be broader and asymmetric, with a shoulder on the high energy\nside that can be attributed to a threshold enhancement in the production of D_1\nD-bar^*.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Dec 2007 23:10:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-24"}

We discuss a few\nexamples, which illustrate the dynamical aspect of the length-contraction\neffect within the framework of Special Relativity. We show some pitfalls\nassociated with direct application of the length contraction formula in cases\nwhen an extended object is accelerated. Our analysis reveals intimate\nconnections between length contraction and the dynamics of internal forces\nwithin the accelerated system.\n  The developed approach is used to analyze the correlation between two\ncongruent disks - one stationary and one rotating (the Ehrenfest paradox).\nSpecifically, we consider the transition of a disk from the state of rest to a\nspinning state under the applied forces. It reveals the underlying physical\nmechanism in the corresponding transition from Euclidean geometry of stationary\ndisk to Lobachevsky's (hyperbolic) geometry of the spinning disk in the process\nof its rotational boost. A conclusion is made that the rest mass of a spinning\ndisk or ring of a fixed radius must contain an additional term representing the\npotential energy of non-Euclidean circumferential deformation of its material.\nPossible experimentally observable manifestations of Lobachevsky's geometry of\nrotating systems are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Dec 2007 03:28:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Nov 2009 00:39:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2020 17:48:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-17"}
