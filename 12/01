Two sources were observed with the\nIRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer, selected to lie in the mass-star formation\nrate correlation at their redshift, thus being representative of massive high-z\ngalaxies. Both sources were detected with high confidence, yielding\nL'_CO~10^{10}K km/s pc^2. For one of the sources we find evidence for velocity\nshear, implying CO sizes of ~10 kpc. With an infrared luminosity of\nL_FIR~10^{12}L_sun, these disk-like galaxies are borderline ULIRGs but with\nstar formation efficiency similar to that of local spirals, and an order of\nmagnitude lower than that in submm galaxies. This suggests a CO to total gas\nconversion factor similar to local spirals, gas consumption timescales\napproaching 1 Gyr or longer and molecular gas masses reaching ~10^11 M_sun,\ncomparable to or larger than the estimated stellar masses. These results\nsupport a major role of 'in situ' gas consumption over cosmological timescales\nand with relatively low star formation efficiency, analogous to that of local\nspiral disks, for the formation of today's most massive galaxies and their\ncentral black holes. Given the high space density of similar galaxies,\n~10^{-4}/Mpc^3, this implies a widespread presence of gas rich galaxies in the\nearly Universe, many of which might be within reach of detailed investigations\nof current and planned facilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2007 18:01:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-26"}

This correlation breaks down for the cooler T\nTauri stars, a fact often interpreted in terms of disks with larger inner\nradii. In most cases, the conversion between the observed interferometric\nvisibility and the calculated disk inner radius was done with a crude disk\nemission model. Here, we examine how the use of models that neglect scattered\nlight can lead to an overestimation of the disk sizes. To do so, synthetic disk\nimages (and visibilities) are calculated with a full treatment of the radiative\ntransfer. The relative contributions of thermal emission and scattered light\nare compared. We find that the latter can not be neglected for cool stars. For\nfurther comparison, the model visibilities are also converted into inner disk\nradii using the same simple disk models as found in the literature. We find\nthat reliable inner radii can only be estimated for Herbig Ae/Be stars with\nthese models. However, they lead to a systematic overestimation of the disk\nsize, by a factor of 2 to 3, for T Tauri stars.

The six H_2 lines have markedly different emission\ndistributions. We obtained the H_2 temperature and surface density\ndistributions by assuming a two temperature model: a warm (T = 100 - 300 K)\nphase traced by the low J (S(0) - S(2)) lines and a hot phase (T = 400 - 1000\nK) traced by the high J (S(2) - S(5)) lines. The lowest molecular gas\ntemperatures are found within the spiral arms (T ~ 155 K), while the highest\ntemperatures are found in the inter-arm regions (T > 700 K). The warm gas\nsurface density reaches a maximum of 11 M_sun/pc^2 in the northwestern spiral\narm, whereas the hot gas surface density peaks at 0.24 M_sun/pc^2 at the\nnucleus. The spatial offset between the peaks in the warm and hot phases and\nthe differences in the distributions of the H_2 line emission suggest that the\nwarm phase is mostly produced by UV photons in star forming regions while the\nhot phase is mostly produced by shocks or X-rays associated with nuclear\nactivity.

The problem is to design a sensing policy for channel\nselection to maximize the average reward, which can be formulated as a\nmulti-arm restless bandit process. In this paper, we study the structure,\noptimality, and performance of the myopic sensing policy. We show that the\nmyopic sensing policy has a simple robust structure that reduces channel\nselection to a round-robin procedure and obviates the need for knowing the\nchannel transition probabilities. The optimality of this simple policy is\nestablished for the two-channel case and conjectured for the general case based\non numerical results. The performance of the myopic sensing policy is analyzed,\nwhich, based on the optimality of myopic sensing, characterizes the maximum\nthroughput of a multi-channel opportunistic communication system and its\nscaling behavior with respect to the number of channels.

We derive these equations in a number of gauges. We\nshow that for viable models that satisfy cosmological and local gravity\nconstraints (LGC), matter perturbation equations derived under a sub-horizon\napproximation are valid even for super-Hubble scales provided the oscillating\nmode (scalaron) does not dominate over the matter-induced mode. Such\napproximate equations are especially reliable in the Palatini formalism because\nof the absence of scalarons.\n  Using these equations we make a comparative study of the behaviour of density\nperturbations as well as gravitational potentials for a number of classes of\ntheories. In the metric formalism the parameter m=Rf_{,RR}/f_{,R}\ncharacterising the deviation from the Lambda CDM model is constrained to be\nvery small during the matter era in order to ensure compatibility with LGC, but\nthe models in which m grows to the order of 10^{-1} around the present epoch\ncan be allowed. These models also suffer from an additional fine tuning due to\nthe presence of scalaron modes which are absent in the Palatini case.\n  In Palatini formalism LGC and background cosmological constraints provide\nonly weak bounds on |m| by constraining it to be smaller than ~ 0.1. This is in\ncontrast to matter density perturbations which, on galactic scales, place far\nmore stringent constraints on the present deviation parameter m of the order of\n|m| < 10^{-5} - 10^{-4}. This is due to the peculiar evolution of matter\nperturbations in the Palatini case which exhibits a rapid growth or a damped\noscillation depending on the sign of m.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Dec 2007 14:11:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Feb 2008 03:00:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The flow stems from a geometrically natural action containing kinetic\nand internal energy terms. As the mean curvature of the hypersurface is the\nmain driving factor, we refer to this model as the hyperbolic mean curvature\nflow (HMCF). The case that the initial velocity field is normal to the\nhypersurface is of particular interest: this property is preserved during the\nevolution and gives rise to a comparatively simpler evolution equation. We also\nconsider the case where the manifold can be viewed as a graph over a fixed\nmanifold. Our main results are as follows. First, we derive several balance\nlaws satisfied by the hypersurface during the evolution. Second, we establish\nthat the initial-value problem is locally well-posed in Sobolev spaces; this is\nachieved by exhibiting a convexity property satisfied by the energy density\nwhich is naturally associated with the flow. Third, we provide some criteria\nensuring that the flow will blow-up in finite time. Fourth, in the case of\ngraphs, we introduce a concept of weak solutions suitably restricted by an\nentropy inequality, and we prove that a classical solution is unique in the\nlarger class of entropy solutions. In the special case of one-dimensional\ngraphs, a global-in-time existence result is established.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Dec 2007 15:58:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-12-04"}
