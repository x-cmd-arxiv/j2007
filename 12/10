Formulas in CL stand for (interactive) computational\nproblems, understood as games between a machine and its environment; logical\noperators represent operations on such entities; and \"truth\" is understood as\nexistence of an effective solution, i.e., of an algorithmic winning strategy.\n  The formalism of CL is open-ended, and may undergo series of extensions as\nthe study of the subject advances.

The aim is to gain a\nthorough understanding of the interplay between electrical conduction and\nmagnetism in atomic-size conductors and how it is affected by different aspects\nas e.g. the atomic structure and the chemical composition of the conductor. To\nthis end our ab initio quantum transport program ALACANT which combines the\nnon-equilibrium Green's function formalism (NEGF) with density functional\ntheory (DFT) calculations has been extended to describe spin-polarized systems.\nWe present calculations on nanocontacts made of Ni as a prototypical magnetic\nmaterial.

On the\nother hand, we show that the adsorption of oxygen in the contact region could\nstrongly enhance the spin-polarization of the conduction electrons and thus BMR\nby eliminating the spin-unpolarized s-channel. Finally, we show that short\natomic Pt chains suspended between the tips of a nanocontact are magnetic in\ncontrast to bulk Pt. However, this emergent nanoscale magnetism barely affects\nthe overall conductance of the nanocontact making it thus difficult to\ndemonstrate by simple conductance measurements.

A suppression of the yield of high p_t (transverse momentum) hadrons in\ncentral Au+Au collisions is found. In contrast, direct photons are not\nsuppressed in central Au+Au collisions and no suppression of high p_t particles\ncan be seen in d+Au collisions. This leads to the conclusion that the dense\nmedium formed in central Au+Au collisions is responsible for the suppression.\nIt is as well found, that the properties of this medium are similar to the one\nof a liquid.

This method allows to derive the Effective\nHamiltonian successfully applied to the meson and ground state baryon spectra.\nThe hyperon spectrum appears to be expressed through two parameters relevant to\nQCD, the string tension \\sigma, the strong coupling constant \\alpha_s, and the\nbare strange quark mass m_s. Using these parameters a unified description of\nthe ground and excited hyperon states is achieved. We also briefly consider the\nnucleon P-wave excitations. In particular, we predict that both the nucleon and\nhyperon states have the similar cost (in \\Delta L) ~460 MeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2007 14:02:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Assuming that the\nsource of the burst is indeed in M31 at a distance of 0.78 Mpc, the measured\nvalues of the fluence $S$ and maximum flux $F_{max}$ correspond to a total\nenergy of $Q = 1.5 \\times 10^{45}$ erg, and a maximum luminosity $L = 1.2\n\\times 10^{47}$ erg s$^{-1}$. These data are in good agreement with the\ncorresponding characteristics of the previously observed giant flares from\nother soft gamma repeaters. The evidence for the identification of this event\nas a giant flare from a soft gamma repeater in the M31 galaxy is presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2007 15:10:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-18"}
