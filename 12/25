More precisely, the mean and\nvariance of the mutual information of the separatelycorrelated Rician fading\nMIMO channel are derived when the number of transmit and receive antennas grows\nasymptotically large and their ratio approaches a finite constant. The\nderivation is based on the replica method, an asymptotic technique widely used\nin theoretical physics and, more recently, in the performance analysis of\ncommunication (CDMA and MIMO) systems. The replica method allows to analyze\nvery difficult system cases in a comparatively simple way though some authors\npointed out that its assumptions are not always rigorous. Being aware of this,\nwe underline the key assumptions made in this setting, quite similar to the\nassumptions made in the technical literature using the replica method in their\nasymptotic analyses. As far as concerns the convergence of the mutual\ninformation to the Gaussian distribution, it is shown that it holds under some\nmild technical conditions, which are tantamount to assuming that the spatial\ncorrelation structure has no asymptotically dominant eigenmodes. The accuracy\nof the asymptotic approach is assessed by providing a sizeable number of\nnumerical results. It is shown that the approximation is very accurate in a\nwide variety of system settings even when the number of transmit and receive\nantennas is as small as a few units.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Dec 2007 16:00:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

Upon introduction of small stochastic forcing, the model\ngenerates irregular bursting. The statistical properties of the emergent\nbursting patterns are studied in the present work. In particular, we identify\ntwo principal statistical regimes associated with the noise-induced bursting.\nIn the first case, (type I) bursting oscillations are created mainly due to the\nfluctuations in the fast subsystem. In the alternative scenario, type II\nbursting, the random perturbations in the slow dynamics play a dominant role.\nWe propose two classes of randomly perturbed slow-fast systems that realize\ntype I and type II scenarios. For these models, we derive the Poincare maps.\nThe analysis of the linearized Poincare maps of the randomly perturbed systems\nexplains the distributions of the number of spikes within one burst and reveals\ntheir dependence on the small and control parameters present in the models. The\nmathematical analysis of the model problems is complemented by the numerical\nexperiments with a generic Hodgkin-Huxley type model of a bursting neuron.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Dec 2007 15:37:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Nov 2008 22:43:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-11"}

Optimization problems are inherent in machine learning\nalgorithms and hence many methods in machine learning were inherited from the\noptimization literature. Popularly known as the initialization problem, the\nideal set of parameters required will significantly depend on the given\ninitialization values. The recently developed TRUST-TECH (TRansformation Under\nSTability-reTaining Equilibria CHaracterization) methodology systematically\nexplores the subspace of the parameters to obtain a complete set of local\noptimal solutions. In this thesis work, we propose TRUST-TECH based methods for\nsolving several optimization and machine learning problems. Two stages namely,\nthe local stage and the neighborhood-search stage, are repeated alternatively\nin the solution space to achieve improvements in the quality of the solutions.\nOur methods were tested on both synthetic and real datasets and the advantages\nof using this novel framework are clearly manifested. This framework not only\nreduces the sensitivity to initialization, but also allows the flexibility for\nthe practitioners to use various global and local methods that work well for a\nparticular problem of interest. Other hierarchical stochastic algorithms like\nevolutionary algorithms and smoothing algorithms are also studied and\nframeworks for combining these methods with TRUST-TECH have been proposed and\nevaluated on several test systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Dec 2007 03:14:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-12-27"}
