Thus, it is\nnatural to study how restrictions on the allowed constraint types (or\nconstraint languages) affect the complexity and approximability of Max CSP. The\nPCP theorem is equivalent to the existence of a constraint language for which\nMax CSP has a hard gap at location 1, i.e. it is NP-hard to distinguish between\nsatisfiable instances and instances where at most some constant fraction of the\nconstraints are satisfiable.

We\nexplore the cosmological degradation vs the size of the spectroscopic survey\nrequired to calibrate the photo-z probability distribution. Previous work has\nassumed a simple Gaussian distribution of photo-z errors; here we describe a\nmethod for constraining an arbitrary parametric photo-z error model. As an\nexample we allow the photo-z probability distribution to be the sum of $N_g$\nGaussians. To limit cosmological degradation to a fixed level, photo-z models\nwith multiple Gaussians require up to 5 times larger calibration sample than\none would estimate from assuming a single-Gaussian model. This degradation\nsaturates at $N_g\\approx 4$. Assuming a single Gaussian when the photo-z\ndistribution has multiple parameters underestimates cosmological parameter\nuncertainties by up to 35%. The size of required calibration sample also\ndepends upon the shape of the fiducial distribution, even when the RMS photo-z\nerror is held fixed. The required calibration sample size varies up to a factor\nof 40 among the fiducial models studied, but this is reduced to a factor of a\nfew if the photo-z parameters are forced to be slowly varying with redshift.\nFinally we show that the size of the required calibration sample can be\nsubstantially reduced by optimizing its redshift distribution.

However, the subhalo mass function at\nredshift zero clearly depends on $M_0$, in that more massive host haloes host\nmore subhaloes. To relate the unevolved and evolved subhalo mass functions, we\nmeasure the subhalo mass loss rate as a function of host mass and redshift.

We assume that gas embedded star clusters start with a power-law\nmass function with slope \\beta=2. The dissolution of the clusters is then\nstudied under the combined influence of residual gas expulsion driven by energy\nfeedback from massive stars, stellar mass-loss, two-body relaxation and an\nexternal tidal field. The influence of residual gas expulsion is studied by\napplying results from a large grid of N-body simulations computed by Baumgardt\n& Kroupa (2007).\n  In our model, star clusters with masses less than 10^5 M_sun lose their\nresidual gas on timescales much shorter than their crossing time and residual\ngas expulsion is the main dissolution mechanism for star clusters, destroying\nabout 95% of all clusters within a few 10s of Myr. We find that in this case\nthe final mass function of globular clusters is established mainly by the gas\nexpulsion and therefore nearly independent of the strength of the external\ntidal field, and that a power-law mass function for the gas embedded star\nclusters is turned into a present-day log-normal one.\n  Another consequence of residual gas expulsion and the associated strong\ninfant mortality of star clusters is that the Galactic halo stars come from\ndissolved star clusters. Since field halo stars would come mainly from\nlow-mass, short-lived clusters, our model provides an explanation for the\nobserved abundance variations of light elements among globular cluster stars\nand the absence of such variations among the halo field stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2007 21:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

To achieve consensus,\ndither (small noise) is added to the sensor states before quantization. When\nthe quantizer range is unbounded (countable number of quantizer levels),\nstochastic approximation shows that consensus is asymptotically achieved with\nprobability one and in mean square to a finite random variable. We show that\nthe meansquared error (m.s.e.) can be made arbitrarily small by tuning the link\nweight sequence, at a cost of the convergence rate of the algorithm. To study\ndithered consensus with random links when the range of the quantizer is\nbounded, we establish uniform boundedness of the sample paths of the unbounded\nquantizer. This requires characterization of the statistical properties of the\nsupremum taken over the sample paths of the state of the quantizer. This is\naccomplished by splitting the state vector of the quantizer in two components:\none along the consensus subspace and the other along the subspace orthogonal to\nthe consensus subspace. The proofs use maximal inequalities for submartingale\nand supermartingale sequences. From these, we derive probability bounds on the\nexcursions of the two subsequences, from which probability bounds on the\nexcursions of the quantizer state vector follow. The paper shows how to use\nthese probability bounds to design the quantizer parameters and to explore\ntradeoffs among the number of quantizer levels, the size of the quantization\nsteps, the desired probability of saturation, and the desired level of accuracy\n$\\epsilon$ away from consensus. Finally, the paper illustrates the quantizer\ndesign with a numerical study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2007 21:38:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2009 20:11:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2009 18:49:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-28"}

Each user's QoS requirement is formulated as a constraint on the mean\nsquare error (MSE) in its received signal, and we show that these MSE\nconstraints imply constraints on the received SINR.

We found that the nuclear spin-lattice\nrelaxation rate divided by temperature $1/T_1T$ at the La site exhibits a\ndifferent temperature dependence from that at the Sb site. Although $1/T_1T$ at\nthe Sb site is explained by the Korringa mechanism, $1/T_1T$ at the La site\nexhibits a broad maximum around 50 K, showing the presence of an additional\ncontribution at the La site. The additional low-lying excitations observed at\nthe La site can be understood with the relaxation from anharmonic phonons due\nto the rattling motion of the La atoms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2007 07:57:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2008 12:38:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-09"}

Our method takes advantage of the same\nelectron bunch to produce both an XFEL pulse and an ultrashort optical pulse\nwith the help of an optical radiator downstream of the x-ray undulator. Since\nboth pulses are produced by the same electron bunch, they are perfectly\nsynchronized. Application of cross-correlation techniques will allow to\ndetermine relative jitter between the optical pulse (and, thus, the XFEL pulse)\nand a pulse from an external pump-laser with femtosecond resolution. Technical\nrealization of the proposed timing scheme uses an optical replica synthesizer\n(ORS) setup to be installed after the final bunch-compression stage of the\nXFEL. The electron bunch is modulated in the ORS setup by an external optical\nlaser. Subsequently, it travels through the main undulator, and produces the\nXFEL pulse. Finally, a powerful optical pulse of coherent edge radiation is\ngenerated as the bunch passes through a long straight section and a separation\nmagnet downstream of the main undulator. Our study shows that at a moderate\n(about 10%) density modulation of the electron bunch at the location of the\noptical radiator allows production of high power x-ray and optical pulses.\nRelative synchronization of these pulses is preserved by using the same\nmechanical support for both x-ray and optical elements transporting radiation\ndown to the experimental area, where single-shot cross-correlation between\noptical pulse and pump-laser pulse is performed.

The inner boundary surrounds the dislocation's core, which is not\ncaptured by the conventional solution. The present gauge approach enables us to\ncontinue the classically known quadratic stresses inside the core. The gauge\nequation is chosen in the Hilbert--Einstein form, and it plays the role of\nnon-conventional incompatibility law. The stress function method is used, and\nit leads to the modified stress potential given by two constituents: the\nconventional one, say, the `background' and a short-ranged gauge contribution.\nThe latter just causes additional stresses, which are localized. The asymptotic\nproperties of the resulting stresses are studied. Since the gauge contributions\nare short-ranged, the background stress field dominates sufficiently far from\nthe core. The outer cylinder's boundary is traction-free. At sufficiently\nmoderate distances, the second order stresses acquire regular continuation\nwithin the core region, and the cut-off at the core does not occur.
