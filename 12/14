We derived bolometric isotropic energies for all GRBs in our\nsample, and found only a tentative correlation between the prompt energy\nrelease and the optical afterglow luminosity at one day after the GRB in the\nz=1 system.

This complex\nstructure, known as the trans-Neptunian belt (or Edgeworth-Kuiper belt), can\nreveal important clues about disk properties, planet formation, and other\nevolutionary processes. In contrast to the predictions of accretion theory,\nTNOs exhibit surprisingly large eccentricities, e, and inclinations, i, which\ncan be grouped into distinct dynamical classes. Several models have addressed\nthe origin and orbital evolution of TNOs, but none have reproduced detailed\nobservations, e.g., all dynamical classes and peculiar objects, or provided\ninsightful predictions. Based on extensive simulations of planetesimal disks\nwith the presence of the four giant planets and massive planetesimals, we\npropose that the orbital history of an outer planet with tenths of Earth's mass\ncan explain the trans-Neptunian belt orbital structure. This massive body was\nlikely scattered by one of the giant planets, which then stirred the primordial\nplanetesimal disk to the levels observed at 40-50 AU and truncated it at about\n48 AU before planet migration. The outer planet later acquired an inclined\nstable orbit (>100 AU; 20-40 deg) because of a resonant interaction with\nNeptune (an r:1 or r:2 resonance possibly coupled with the Kozai mechanism),\nguaranteeing the stability of the trans-Neptunian belt.

However, within the current IEEE\n802.11 legacy, MAC-layer throughput is dominated by users with the lowest data\nrates, resulting in underutilization of bandwidth. In this paper, we propose\nand analyze a novel distributed MAC strategy, referred to as Rate-aware DCF\n(R-DCF), to leverage the potential of rate adaptation in IEEE 802.11 WLANs. The\nkey feature of R-DCF is that by introducing different mini slots according to\nthe instantaneous channel conditions, only contending stations with the highest\ndata rate can access the channel. In this way, the R-DCF protocol not only\nexploits multi-user diversity in a fully distributed manner but also reduces\nthe loss of throughput due to collisions. Through analysis, we develop an\nanalytical model to derive the throughput of R-DCF in general multi-rate WLANs.\nUsing the analytical model we investigate the performance of R-DCF protocol in\nvarious network settings with different rate adaptation strategies and channel\nvariations. Based on the analysis, we further derive the maximal throughput\nachievable by R-DCF. For practical implementation, an offline adaptive backoff\nmethod is developed to achieve a close-to-optimal performance at low runtime\ncomplexity. The superiority of R-DCF is proven via extensive analyses and\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2007 02:07:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-12-17"}

Holographic observations, sampling angular\nscales between about 5 arcmin and 11 degrees, were obtained of a bright compact\nsource (3C147).

The ratio of the magnetic flux to the\nelectric current is called the (magnetic) self inductance. Can there be a dual\nsituation with a magnetic current flowing around a loop and producing an\nelectric field and hence an electric flux through the loop? Following the\nclassical electrodynamics laws an answer to this question should be negative.\nNevertheless special spectral properties of magnetic dipolar modes in a\nquasi-2D ferrite disk show there are the double-valued-function loop magnetic\ncurrents which may produce eigen electric fields and hence eigen electric\nfluxes through the loop.

Lett. {\\bf 98}, 036805 (2007)]\nreported switches between 0 and $\\pi$ in the phase of Aharonov-Bohm\noscillations of the two-terminal differential conductance through a two-dot\nring with increasing voltage bias. Using a simple model, where one of the dots\ncontains multiple interacting levels, these findings are explained as a result\nof transport through the interferometer being dominated at different biases by\nquantum dot levels of different \"parity\" (i.e. the sign of the overlap integral\nbetween the dot state and the states in the leads). The redistribution of\nelectron population between different levels with bias leads to the fact that\nthe number of switching events is not necessarily equal to the number of dot\nlevels, in agreement with experiment. For the same reason switching does not\nalways imply that the parity of levels is strictly alternating. Lastly, it is\ndemonstrated that the correlation between the first switching of the phase and\nthe onset of the inelastic cotunneling, as well as the sharp (rather than\ngradual) change of phase when switching occurs, give reason to think that the\npresent interpretation of the experiment is preferable to the one based on\nelectrostatic AB effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2007 09:49:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
