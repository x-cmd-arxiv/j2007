The\nother phase occurs in an effective particle state, with the effective energy\nand momentum being the rate of change of the phase with respect to time and\ndistance. A cosmic ray proton moves along a classical trajectory, but exists in\nan effective particle state with an effective energy that depends on the local\ngravitational potential. Assumptions are made so that a cosmic ray proton in an\nultra-high energy state detected near the Earth was in a much less energetic\nstate in interstellar space. A 300 EeV proton incident on the Earth was a 2 PeV\nproton in interstellar space. The model predicts such protons are in states\nwith even more energy near the Sun than when near the Earth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Dec 2007 15:22:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-05"}

Recent studies have shown that\nthe tunnelling conductance can be fit using a BCS-type density of states for a\nd-wave superconductor with a local quasiparticle scattering rate. The fit is\nmade with a scattering rate which varies linearly with energy and has a slope\nthat is positively correlated with the local value of the gap. We revisit a\nmodel of quasiparticle scattering by impurities and spin fluctuations which was\npreviously used to describe the lifetimes of nodal quasiparticles measured by\nangle-resolved photoemission (ARPES). We argue that the broadening of the local\ndensity of states is in general determined by the imaginary part of the\nself-energy of the system averaged over a small region. The size of this region\nis set by a mean free path which depends upon the energy. At low energies, this\nregion is found to be significantly larger than a gap \"patch\", so that the\ndensity of states measured by STS is homogeneous in this energy range. At\nhigher energies where the mean free path is comparable with the patch size, the\ndensity of states is inhomogeneous. We show that a local self-energy in the\nimpurity-plus-spin fluctuation model, while not strictly linear, yields a local\ndensity of states (LDOS) nearly identical to the full theory, and argue that it\nis consistent with the STS data as well as the phenomenological linear\nscattering rate extracted from experiment. We also explore the qualitative\nconsequences of this phenomenology for the spectral widths observed in ARPES\nand predict the existence of Fermi arcs in the superconducting state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Dec 2007 03:07:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-05-30"}

A functional RG\nanalysis shows that any small inter-layer viscous coupling destablizes the\nstandard (decoupled) elastic depinning FRG fixed point for d <= 4, while for d\n> 4 most aspects of the mean-field theory are recovered.

We point out that this ambiguity can be\nremoved with the help of B_s -> D_s K decays. We compare untagged and tagged\nstrategies and find the tagged analysis more promising. The removal of the sign\nambiguity in Delta Gamma_s can be done with relatively low statistics and could\ntherefore be a target for the early stage of B_s -> D_s K studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Dec 2007 15:44:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Mar 2008 10:54:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2012 19:34:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-14"}

From this we introduce a\ngeneral method for generating new families of scale functions. Using this\nmethod we introduce a new family of scale functions belonging to the Gaussian\nTempered Stable Convolution (GTSC) class. We give particular emphasis to\nspecial cases as well as cross-referencing their analytical behaviour against\nknown general considerations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Dec 2007 21:19:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Jul 2008 22:40:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-05"}
