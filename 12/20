We present local two and three-dimensional\nsimulations of a new heat flux driven buoyancy instability (the HBI) that\noccurs when the temperature in a plasma decreases in the direction of gravity.\nWe find that the HBI drives a convective dynamo that amplifies an initially\nweak magnetic field by a factor of ~20. In simulations that begin with the\nmagnetic field aligned with the temperature gradient, the HBI saturates by\nrearranging the magnetic field lines to be almost purely perpendicular to the\ninitial temperature gradient. This magnetic field reorientation results in a\nnet heat flux through the plasma that is less than 1% of the field-free\n(Spitzer) value. We show that the HBI is likely to be present in the cool cores\nof clusters of galaxies between ~0.1-100 kpc, where the temperature increases\noutwards. The saturated state of the HBI suggests that inward thermal\nconduction from large radii in clusters is unlikely to solve the cooling flow\nproblem. Finally, we also suggest that the HBI may contribute to suppressing\nconduction across cold fronts in galaxy clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2007 17:21:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-09"}

To this end, there are two opposite approaches: (i) one may use a\ndecomposition into the restricted instruction set (RISC) of universal one- and\ntwo-qubit gates, which in turn have prefabricated translations into the machine\ncode or (ii) one may prefer to generate the entire target module directly by a\ncomplex instruction set (CISC) of available controls.

The qualitative difference\ncomes from the fact that photoelectrons from the 4d Giant resonance has small\nenergies (tens of eV) and are strongly reflected by the C60 fullerenes shell.\nAs to the Eu@C60, Giant autoionization leads to fast photoelectrons (about\nhundred eV) that go out almost untouched by the C60 shell.

It is not coincident with the strong\nearly-time flares seen in the X-ray and gamma-ray energy bands. There is weak\nevidence for variability superposed on this dominant component in several\noptical bands that can be related to flares in high energy bands. While for a\nsmall number of GRBs, well-sampled optical flares have been observed\nsimultaneously with X-ray and gamma ray pulses, GRB 060607A is one of the few\ncases where the early optical emission shows no significant evidence for\ncorrelation with the prompt emission. In this work we first report in detail\nthe broad band observations of this burst by Swift. Then by applying a simple\nmodel for the dynamics and the synchrotron radiation of a relativistic shock,\nwe show that the dominant component of the early emissions in optical\nwavelengths has the same origin as the tail emission produced after the main\ngamma ray activity. The most plausible explanation for the peak in the optical\nlight curve seems to be the cooling of the prompt after the main collisions,\nshifting the characteristic synchrotron frequency to the optical bands. It\nseems that the cooling process requires a steepening of the electron energy\ndistribution and/or a break in this distribution at high energies. The sharp\nbreak in the X-ray light curve at few thousands of seconds after the trigger,\nis not observed in the IR/optical/UV bands, and therefore can not be a jet\nbreak. Either the X-ray break is due to a change in the spectrum of the\naccelerated electrons or the lack of an optical break is due to the presence of\na related delayed response component (Abbreviated).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2007 20:24:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

In this case, it is shown\nthat bit energy requirements grow without bound as the signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) goes to zero, and the minimum bit energy is achieved at a nonzero SNR\nvalue below which one should not operate. The effect of the block length on\nboth the minimum bit energy and the SNR value at which the minimum is achieved\nis investigated.

When the dark matter halo is\nsufficiently massive to support the propagation of a stable shock, cold\naccretion is shut down, and the star formation rate begins to decline. Mergers\ntransform the disc into an elliptical galaxy, but also bring gas into the\ngalaxy. Without a mechanism that removes gas from the merger remnants, the\ngalaxy ends up with blue colours, atypical for its elliptical morphology.

We\nemploy very optimistic assumptions on the twin fraction (50%) among all\nbinaries, and therefore our calculations place an upper limits on the influence\nof twins on double compact object populations. We show that for LIGO the effect\nof including twins is relatively minor: although the merger rates does indeed\nincrease when twins are considered, the rate increase is fairly small (1.5).\nAlso, chirp mass distribution for double compact objects formed with or without\ntwins are almost indistinguishable. If double compact object are short-hard GRB\nprogenitors, including twins in population synthesis calculations does not\nalter significantly the earlier rate predictions for the event rate. However,\nfor one channel of binary evolution, introducing twins more than doubles the\nrate of ``very prompt'' NS-NS mergers (time to merger less than 1 Myr) compared\nto models with the ``flat'' q distribution. In that case, 70% of all NS-NS\nbinaries merge within 100 Myr after their formation, indicating a possibility\nof a very significant population of ``prompt'' short-hard gamma-ray bursts,\nassociated with star forming galaxies. We also point out that, independent of\nassumptions, fraction of such prompt neutron star mergers is always high,\n35--70%. We note that recent observations (e.g., Berger et al.) indicate that\nfraction of short-hard GRBs found in young hosts is at least 40% and possibly\neven 80%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2007 23:02:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-12-21"}

However, we still do not\nunderstand the interaction between various graph-theoretic (topological)\nproperties of graphs, and the doubling (geometric) properties of the\nshortest-path metrics induced by them. For instance, the following natural\nquestion suggests itself: \\emph{given a finite doubling metric $(V,d)$, is\nthere always an \\underline{unweighted} graph $(V',E')$ with $V\\subseteq V'$\nsuch that the shortest path metric $d'$ on $V'$ is still doubling, and which\nagrees with $d$ on $V$.} This is often useful, given that unweighted graphs are\noften easier to reason about.\n  We show that for any metric space $(V,d)$, there is an \\emph{unweighted}\ngraph $(V',E')$ with shortest-path metric $d':V'\\times V' \\to \\R_{\\geq 0}$ such\nthat\n  -- for all $x,y \\in V$, the distances $d(x,y) \\leq d'(x,y) \\leq (1+\\eps)\n\\cdot d(x,y)$, and\n  -- the doubling dimension for $d'$ is not much more than that of $d$, where\nthis change depends only on $\\e$ and not on the size of the graph.\n  We show a similar result when both $(V,d)$ and $(V',E')$ are restricted to be\ntrees: this gives a simpler proof that doubling trees embed into constant\ndimensional Euclidean space with constant distortion. We also show that our\nresults are tight in terms of the tradeoff between distortion and dimension\nblowup.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2007 06:12:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Dec 2007 12:32:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-12-27"}

When the pacing rate of a\nperiodic train of stimuli is increased above a critical value, the action\npotential undergoes a period-doubling bifurcation, where the resulting\nalternation of the action potential duration is known as alternans in the\nmedical literature. Existing cardiac models treat alternans either as a smooth\nor as a border-collision bifurcation. However, recent experiments in paced\ncardiac tissue reveal that the bifurcation to alternans exhibits hybrid\nsmooth/nonsmooth behaviors, which can be qualitatively described by a model of\nso-called unfolded border-collision bifurcation. In this paper, we obtain\nanalytical solutions of the unfolded border-collision model and use it to\nexplore the crossover between smooth and nonsmooth behaviors.

This study also shows that in highly non homogeneous\nmagnetic configuration (non adiabatic limit), the contribution of the\ndiffracted electrons is crucial to describe spin transport in such structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2007 09:31:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

TAUVEX is a collaborative effort\nbetween the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) and Tel Aviv University, and\nis scheduled for an early-2009 launch with at least three years of operations.\nThe scientific instrument has been fabricated at El-Op in Israel, with the\nsatellite interfaces, launch and flight operations provided by the Indian Space\nResearch Organization (ISRO). The ground-based software development is the\nresponsibility of the IIA while other aspects of the mission are the joint\nresponsibility of IIA and Tel Aviv University. TAUVEX Science Team (TST) have\ncreated a coherent observing program to address several Key Areas science\nobjectives, one of them is a program to study short-scale UV transient events.\nWe have estimated that in one year of TAUVEX observations we can expect about\n90-350 short-scale transient events.

An interferometer\nsignal displays noise due to the uncertainty of relative positions of\nreflection events. The noise corresponds to an accumulation of phase offset\nwith time that mimics a random walk of those optical elements that change the\norientation of a wavefront. It only appears in measurements that compare\ntransverse positions, and does not appear at all in purely radial position\nmeasurements. A lower bound on holographic noise follows from a covariant upper\nbound on gravitational entropy. The predicted holographic noise spectrum is\nestimated to be comparable to measured noise in the currently operating\ninterferometer GEO600.

Chemical evolution\nmodels computed with the inclusion of the yields of fast rotating models at a\nmetallicity $Z=10^{-8}$ can account for the high N/O abundances observed in\nnormal metal-poor halo stars. If, as believed, intermediate mass stars did not\nhave enough time to contribute to the interstellar medium enrichment at such\nlow metallicities, the above result constitutes a strong case for the existence\nof fast rotators in the primordial Universe. An important result of stellar\nmodels of fast rotators is that large quantities of primary 13C are produced.\nHence, our goal is to investigate the consequence of fast rotation on the\nevolution of the 12C/13C ratio in the interstellar medium at low metallicity.\nWe predict that, if fast rotating massive stars were common phenomena in the\nearly Universe, the primordial interstellar medium of galaxies with a star\nformation history similar to the one inferred for our galactic halo should have\n12C/13C ratios between 30-300.

Our analysis is aimed at\ninvestigating the X-ray spectral properties of this peculiar source which have\nremained poorly known so far. We analyze the 0.5--10 keV spectroscopic data\ncollected by the EPIC cameras in 2006. The X-ray spectrum of this radio-loud\nquasar is typical of a local Compton-thin Seyfert 2 galaxy. It exhibits strong\nabsorption (Nh~3.5 x 10^{23} cm^{-2}) and a narrow, neutral Fe Kalpha emission\nline with an equivalent width of ~140+/-40 eV. Our observation also reveals\nthat the soft portion of the spectrum is characterized by strong emission lines\nwith a very low level of scattered primary continuum. A possible explanation of\nthese features in terms of thermal emission from a two-temperature\ncollisionally ionized plasma emission seems to be unlikely due to the high\nluminosity estimated for this component (L(0.5-2) ~ 6 x 10^{42} erg/s).

Hard X-ray observations\nimply that a substantial fraction of flare energy released during the impulsive\nphase is converted to the kinetic energy of mildly relativistic electrons\n(10-100 keV). The liberation of the magnetic free energy can occur as the\ncoronal magnetic field reconfigures and relaxes following reconnection. We\ninvestigate a scenario in which products of the reconfiguration - large-scale\nAlfven wave pulses - transport the energy and magnetic-field changes rapidly\nthrough the corona to the lower atmosphere. This offers two possibilities for\nelectron acceleration. Firstly, in a coronal plasma with beta < m_e/m_p, the\nwaves propagate as inertial Alfven waves. In the presence of strong spatial\ngradients, these generate field-aligned electric fields that can accelerate\nelectrons to energies on the order of 10 keV and above, including by repeated\ninteractions between electrons and wavefronts. Secondly, when they reflect and\nmode-convert in the chromosphere, a cascade to high wavenumbers may develop.\nThis will also accelerate electrons by turbulence, in a medium with a locally\nhigh electron number density. This concept, which bridges MHD-based and\nparticle-based views of a flare, provides an interpretation of the\nrecently-observed rapid variations of the line-of-sight component of the\nphotospheric magnetic field across the flare impulsive phase, and offers\nsolutions to some perplexing flare problems, such as the flare \"number problem\"\nof finding and resupplying sufficient electrons to explain the impulsive-phase\nhard X-ray emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2007 15:11:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The results of the present paper may be\nviewed as an extension of the theory developed so far by other authors.\n  First, we prove that if X is an n-dimensional compactum with $H^n(X) \\neq 0$\nthat embeds in either a product of n curves or the nth symmetric product of a\ncurve, then there exists an algebraically essential map of X into the n-torus.\nConsequently, there exist elements $a_1,...,a_n$ in $H^1(X)$ whose cup product\nis non-zero. Therefore, the rank of $H^1(X)$ is at least n, and the category of\nX exceeds n. Next, we introduce some new classes of n-dimensional continua and\nshow that embeddability of locally connected quasi n-manifolds into products of\nn curves also implies that the rank of $H^1(X)$ is at least n. It follows that\nsome 2-dimensional contractible polyhedra are not embeddable in products of two\ncurves. On the other hand, we show that any collapsible 2-dimensional\npolyhedron can be embedded in a product of two trees. We answer a question\nposed by Cauty proving that closed surfaces embeddable in products of two\ncurves can be also embedded in products of two graphs. We prove that no closed\nsurface, different from the 2-torus, lying in a product of two curves is a\nretract of that product.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2007 15:45:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-12-21"}
