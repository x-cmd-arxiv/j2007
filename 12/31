For a wide range of the\nparameters n,k and p we find an explicit lower bound for this probability which\nmatches an upper bound given by Benjamini et al., up to multiplicative factors\nof lower order.

To avoid apparent divergences at large\ndistances, the details of the method are important, especially the choice of\nthe foliation, the spacetime surfaces on which the orbital elements are taken\nto be constant. Here we apply the two-timescale approach to a simple linear\nmodel to demonstrate the details of the method. In particular we use it to show\nthat a null foliation avoids large-distance divergences in the first-order\npost-adiabatic approximation, and we argue that this will be true more\ngenerally for a null foliation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Dec 2007 03:05:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Although there exists\nonly one crystallographic site for Ga in NiGa$_2$S$_4$, we found two distinct\nGa signals by NMR and NQR. The origin of the two Ga signals is not fully\nunderstood, but possibly due to stacking faults along the c axis which induce\nadditional broad Ga NMR and NQR signals with different local symmetries. We\nfound the novel spin freezing occurring at $T_{\\rm f}$, at which the specific\nheat shows a maximum, from a clear divergent behavior of the nuclear\nspin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_{1}$ and nuclear spin-spin relaxation rate\n$1/T_{2}$ measured by Ga-NQR as well as the muon spin relaxation rate\n$\\lambda$. The main sharp NQR peaks exhibit a stronger tendency of divergence,\ncompared with the weak broader spectral peaks, indicating that the spin\nfreezing is intrinsic in NiGa$_2$S$_4$. The behavior of these relaxation rates\nstrongly suggests that the Ni spin fluctuations slow down towards $T_{\\rm f}$,\nand the temperature range of the divergence is anomalously wider than that in a\nconventional magnetic ordering. A broad structureless spectrum and\nmulti-component $T_1$ were observed below 2 K, indicating that a static\nmagnetic state with incommensurate magnetic correlations or inhomogeneously\ndistributed moments is realized at low temperatures.

Our\nmodel naturally predicts that the SN Ia lifetime distribution spans a range of\n0.1-20 Gyr with the double peaks at ~0.1 and 1 Gyr. While the present SN Ia\nrate in elliptical galaxies can be reproduced with the old population of the\nred-giants+WD systems, the large SN Ia rate in radio galaxies could be\nexplained with the young population of the main-sequence+WD systems. Because of\nthe metallicity effect, i.e., because of the lack of winds from WDs in the\nbinary systems, the SN Ia rate in the systems with [Fe/H]<-1, e.g., high-z\nspiral galaxies, is supposed to be very small. Our SN Ia model can give better\nreproduction of the [(alpha, Mn, Zn)/Fe]-[Fe/H] relations in the solar\nneighborhood than other models such as the double-degenerate scenario. The\nmetallicity effect is more strongly required in the presence of the young\npopulation of SNe Ia. We also succeed in reproducing the galactic supernova\nrates with their dependence on the morphological type of galaxies, and the\ncosmic SN Ia rate history with a peak at z~1. At z>1, the predicted SN Ia rate\ndecreases toward higher redshifts and SNe Ia will be observed only in the\nsystems that have evolved with a short timescale of chemical enrichment.
