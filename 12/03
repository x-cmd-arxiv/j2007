We prove here several additional results on local sentences. The\nfirst one is a new decidability result in the case of local sentences whose\nfunction symbols are at most unary: one can decide, for every regular cardinal\nk whether a local sentence phi has a model of order type k. Secondly we show\nthat this result can not be extended to the general case. Assuming the\nconsistency of an inaccessible cardinal we prove that the set of local\nsentences having a model of order type omega_2 is not determined by the\naxiomatic system ZFC + GCH, where GCH is the generalized continuum hypothesis\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Dec 2007 18:34:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-12-04"}

Non-backtracking\nwalks of a given length can be counted using the non-backtracking adjacency\nmatrix, $B$, indexed by $H$'s directed edges and related to Ihara's Zeta\nfunction. We show how to determine $B$'s spectrum in the case where $H$ is a\ntree covering a finite graph.

We assume that the elements of the network are identical ($N$\nlogistic maps in the regime where the individual maps, without coupling, evolve\nin a chaotic orbit) and that the coupling strengths are uniform throughout the\nnetwork. We show that if the delay times are sufficiently heterogeneous, for\nadequate coupling strength the network synchronizes in a spatially homogeneous\nsteady-state, which is unstable for the individual maps without coupling. This\nsynchronization behavior is referred to as ``suppression of chaos by random\ndelays'' and is in contrast with the synchronization when all the interaction\ndelay times are homogeneous, because with homogeneous delays the network\nsynchronizes in a state where the elements display in-phase time-periodic or\nchaotic oscillations. We analyze the influence of the network topology\nconsidering four different types of networks: two regular (a ring-type and a\nring-type with a central node) and two random (free-scale Barabasi-Albert and\nsmall-world Newman-Watts). We find that when the delay times are sufficiently\nheterogeneous the synchronization behavior is largely independent of the\nnetwork topology but depends on the networks connectivity, i.e., on the average\nnumber of neighbors per node.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2007 15:45:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
