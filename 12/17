A naturalness probability, P, is introduced to numerically evaluate\nthe unnaturalness. If P is small in all known theories, there is an observer\nnaturalness problem. In addition to the well-known case of the cosmological\nconstant, we argue that nuclear stability and electroweak symmetry breaking\n(EWSB) represent significant observer naturalness problems. The naturalness\nprobability associated with nuclear stability is conservatively estimated as\nP_nuc < 10^{-(3-2)}, and for simple EWSB theories P_EWSB < 10^{-(2-1)}. This\npattern of unnaturalness in three different arenas, cosmology, nuclear physics,\nand EWSB, provides evidence for the multiverse. In the nuclear case the problem\nis largely solved even with a flat multiverse distribution, and with nontrivial\ndistributions it is possible to understand both the proximity to neutron\nstability and the values of m_e and m_d - m_u in terms of the electromagnetic\ncontribution to the proton mass. It is reasonable that multiverse distributions\nare strong functions of Lagrangian parameters due to their dependence on\nvarious factors. In any EWSB theory, strongly varying distributions typically\nlead to a little or large hierarchy, and in certain multiverses the size of the\nlittle hierarchy is enhanced by a loop factor. Since the correct theory of EWSB\nis unknown, our estimate for P_EWSB is theoretical. The LHC will determine\nP_EWSB more robustly, which may remove or strengthen the observer naturalness\nproblem of EWSB. For each of the three arenas, the discovery of a natural\ntheory would eliminate the evidence for the multiverse; but in the absence of\nsuch a theory, the multiverse provides a provisional understanding of the data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2007 14:43:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

This paper explores the fact that the electron beams moving oblique\nto the magnetic field or along the field with some angular scatter around the\nbeam propagation direction can generate microwave continuum bursts via\ngyrosynchrotron mechanism. The characteristics of the microwave bursts produced\nby beams differ from those in case of isotropic or loss-cone distributions,\nwhich suggests a new tool for quantitative diagnostics of the beams in the\nsolar corona.

For the first time we developed and\napplied a new forward fitting algorithm based on exact gyrosynchrotron formulae\nand employing both the total power and polarization measurements to solve the\ninverse problem of the beam diagnostics.

Nevertheless, the major obstacle that\nprevents from the practice of the codes is that the existing codes are mostly\nsearched by computers, and hence exhibit no good structure for efficient\ndecoding. Hence, the time-consuming exhaustive search becomes the only decoding\nchoice, and the decoding complexity increases dramatically with the codeword\nlength.

Here we propose a straightforward method to determine\nthe extinction of GRB host galaxies by comparing the observed optical spectra\nto the intrinsic ones extrapolated from the X-ray spectra. The rationale for\nthis method is from the standard fireball model: if the optical flux decay\nindex equals to that of the X-ray flux, then there is no break frequency\nbetween the optical and X-ray bands, therefore we can derive the intrinsic\noptical flux from the X-ray spectra. We apply this method to three GRBs of\nwhich the optical and X-ray fluxes have the same decay indices and another one\nwith inferred cooling break frequency, and obtain the rest-frame extinction\ncurves of their host galaxies. The derived extinction curves are gray and do\nnot resemble any extinction curves of local galaxies (e.g. the Milk Way, the\nSmall/Large Magellanic Clouds, or nearby starburst galaxies). The amount of\nextinction is rather large (with visual extinction $A_V$ $\\sim$\n1.6--3.4$\\magni$). We model the derived extinction curves in terms of the\nsilicate-graphite interstellar grain model. As expected from the ``gray''\nnature of the derived extinction curve, the dust size distribution is skewed to\nlarge grains. We determine, for the first time, the local dust-to-gas ratios of\nGRB host galaxies using the model-derived dust parameters and the hydrogen\ncolumn densities determined from X-ray absorptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2007 03:47:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-12"}

A Brownian Dynamics algorithm is suggested to\nevolve this equation numerically, allowing for the prediction of effective\n(projected) diffusion coefficients over corrugated surfaces. In the case of\nstatic surface roughness, we find that a simple area-scaling prediction for the\nprojected diffusion coefficient leads to seemingly quantitative agreement with\nnumerical results. To study the effect of dynamic surface evolution on the\ndiffusive process, we consider particle diffusion over a thermally fluctuating\nelastic membrane. Surface fluctuation has the effect of increasing the\neffective diffusivity toward a limiting annealed-surface value discussed\npreviously. We argue that protein motion over cell surfaces spans a variety of\nphysical regimes, making it impossible to identify a single approximation\nscheme appropriate to all measurements of interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2007 10:53:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We discuss performance and intrinsic limitations of the new\nmagnetic Doppler imaging method. A special emphasis is given to the\nsimultaneous modelling of the magnetically sensitive lines in the optical and\ninfrared regions and to combining information from both atomic and molecular\nspectral features. These two techniques may, for the first time, give us a tool\nto study magnetic fields in the starspot interiors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2007 15:43:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

In the model, the set of\nefficient graphs ranges, depending on the cost for maintaining a link, from the\ncomplete graph to the (quasi-) star, varying within a well defined class of\ngraphs. However, the interplay between dynamics on the nodes and topology of\nthe network leads to equilibrium networks which are typically not efficient and\nare characterized, as observed in empirical studies of R&D networks, by\nsparseness, presence of clusters and heterogeneity of degree. In this paper, we\nanalyze the relation between the growth rate of the knowledge stock of the\nagents from R&D collaborations and the properties of the adjacency matrix\nassociated with the network of collaborations. By means of computer simulations\nwe further investigate how the equilibrium network is affected by increasing\nthe evaluation time $\\tau$ over which agents evaluate whether to maintain a\nlink or not. We show that only if $\\tau$ is long enough, efficient networks can\nbe obtained by the selfish link formation process of agents, otherwise the\nequilibrium network is inefficient.
