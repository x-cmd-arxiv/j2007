The early phase of\nthe flare shows evidence for the Neupert effect, followed by a further rise and\nthen a two-component exponential decay. A large flare was also observed at the\nend of a later 48-ks HRC-I observation. Emission from the non-flaring phases of\nboth observations was analyzed for evidence of low level flaring.

In this method, galaxies are used as tracers of the distribution\nof matter and samples derived from various galaxy redshift surveys have been\nused to determine the scale of homogeneity in the Universe.

With our present numerical setup with no disc\nmagnetic field, we found no evidence of winds, neither disc driven nor X-winds,\nand the star is only spun up by its interaction with the disc. Conclusions :\nWeak dipole fields, similar in magnitude to those observed, lead to the\ndevelopment of accretion funnel flows in weakly accreting T Tauri stars.\nHowever, the higher accretion observed for most T Tauri stars (${\\dot M} \\sim\n10^{-8} M_\\odot.yr^{-1}$) requires either larger stellar field strength and/or\ndifferent magnetic topologies to allow for magnetospheric accretion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2007 10:33:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Further along, it gained additional\nsubstance with the advent of the interdisciplinary fields of particle biology\nand peptide strings which explain (onco)protein dynamics in spacetime, for\ninstance insulin-driven sub- and trans-cellular carcinogenesis, by physical\nprinciples. Here, this new understanding is expanded to introduce the concept\nof \"oncoprotein metastasis\" preceding cancer cell spread and, thereby, a\nparticular emphasis is placed on its potential role in the emergence of the\npre-metastatic niche. Consistent with this perception, yet unlike currently\nadvocated treatments that target cancer cells only, future antineoplastic\nstrategies should aim to mimic natural tumor suppressors as well as involve\nboth (morphologically) normal and malignant cells. If validated in human\npatients with advanced cancer disease, its otherwise frequently lethal course\nmay be halted and reversed just in time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2007 15:14:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-12-19"}

For the\ncross-stream scalar flux, in the inertial range the spectral behavior agrees\nwith classical predictions and measurements. The streamwise scalar flux is\nfound to be in good agreement with the results of atmospheric measurements.\nHowever, both the model results and the atmospheric measurements disagree with\nclassical predictions. A detailed analysis of the different terms in the\nevolution equation for the streamwise scalar flux spectrum shows that nonlinear\ncontributions are governing the inertial subrange of this spectrum and that\nthese contributions are relatively more important than for the cross-stream\nflux.
