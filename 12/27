The\nhybrid automatic retransmission request (HARQ) protocol is revisited for a\nblock-fading wire-tap channel, in which two legitimate users communicate over a\nblock-fading channel in the presence of a passive eavesdropper who intercepts\nthe transmissions through an independent block-fading channel. In this model,\nthe transmitter obtains a 1-bit ACK/NACK feedback from the legitimate receiver\nvia an error-free public channel. Both reliability and confidentiality of\nsecure HARQ protocols are studied by the joint consideration of channel coding,\nsecrecy coding, and retransmission protocols. In particular, the error and\nsecrecy performance of repetition time diversity (RTD) and incremental\nredundancy (INR) protocols are investigated based on good Wyner code sequences,\nwhich ensure that the confidential message is decoded successfully by the\nlegitimate receiver and is kept in total ignorance by the eavesdropper for a\ngiven set of channel realizations.

This allows us to prove\nthat, when $\\alpha$ is very large (case of an ideal, perfectly reflecting\nmirror) a thermal emission of scalar massless particles obeying Bose-Einstein\nstatistics is radiated from the mirror (a black body radiation), in accordance\nwith results previously obtained in the literature. However, when $\\alpha$ is\nfinite (semitransparent mirror, a physically realistic situation) the striking\nresult is obtained that the thermal emission of scalar massless particles obeys\nFermi-Dirac statistics. We also show here that the reverse change of statistics\ntakes place in a bidimensional fermionic model for massless particles, namely\nthat the Fermi-Dirac statistics for the completely reflecting situation will\nturn into the Bose-Einstein statistics for a partially reflecting, physical\nmirror.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Dec 2007 18:53:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2008 11:21:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The host galaxy spectrum is best described\nby an intermediate-age (1.3 Gyr) stellar population (4% by mass), superimposed\non a 10 Gyr old population and a power law (\\alpha_{\\lambda} = -1.8); the\nstellar populations are consistent with super-solar metallicities, with the\nbest fit given by the 2.5 Z_sun models.

This work is aimed at identifying and/or\nconfirming the IR counterparts of these magnetars, as well as at measuring\ntheir possible IR variability. <Methods>.

Specifically, we\nstudy a five-dimensional model cosmology in type IIB supergravity, where the\ndual theory is an unstable deformation of $\\N=4$ supersymmetric SU(N) gauge\ntheory on $\\Rbar\\times S^3$. A one-loop computation shows that the coupling\ngoverning the instability is asymptotically free, so quantum corrections cannot\nturn the potential around. The big crunch singularity in the bulk occurs when a\nboundary scalar field runs to infinity, in finite time. Consistent quantum\nevolution requires that we impose boundary conditions at infinite scalar field,\ni.e. a self-adjoint extension of the system. We find that quantum spreading of\nthe homogeneous mode of the boundary scalar leads to a natural UV cutoff in\nparticle production as the wavefunction for the homogeneous mode bounces back\nfrom infinity. However a perturbative calculation indicates that despite this,\nthe logarithmic running of the boundary coupling governing the instability\ngenerally leads to significant particle production across the bounce. This\nprevents the wave packet of the homogeneous boundary scalar to return close to\nits initial form.

The dynamics of those systems can be formulated\nwithin the unifying framework of evolutionary game theory. However it is not a\npriori clear which mathematical description is appropriate when populations are\nnot infinitely large. Whereas the replicator equation approach describes the\ninfinite population size limit by deterministic differential equations, in\nfinite populations the dynamics is inherently stochastic which can lead to new\neffects. Recently, an explicit mean-field description in the form of a\nFokker-Planck equation was derived for frequency-dependent selection in finite\npopulations based on microscopic processes. In asymmetric conflicts between two\npopulations with a cyclic dominance, a finite-size dependent drift reversal was\ndemonstrated, depending on the underlying microscopic process of the\nevolutionary update. Cyclic dynamics appears widely in biological coevolution,\nbe it within a homogeneous population, or be it between disjunct populations as\nfemale and male. Here explicit analytic address is given and the average drift\nis calculated for the frequency-dependent Moran process and for different\npairwise comparison processes. It is explicitely shown that the drift reversal\ncannot occur if the process relies on payoff differences between pairs of\nindividuals. Further, also a linear comparison with the average payoff does not\nlead to a drift towards the internal fixed point. Hence the nonlinear\ncomparison function of the frequency-dependent Moran process, together with its\nusage of nonlocal information via the average payoff, is the essential part of\nthe mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Dec 2007 12:08:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-12"}

H. Bennett and G.\nBrassard in 1984, describes how two spatially separated parties can generate a\nrandom bit string fully known only to them by transmission of single-qubit\nquantum states. Any attempt to eavesdrop on the protocol introduces disturbance\nwhich can be detected by the legitimate parties. In this Master's Thesis a\nnovel modification to the BB84 protocol is analyzed. Instead of sending single\nparticles one-by-one as in BB84, they are grouped and a non-local\ntransformation is applied to each group before transmission. Each particle is\nsent to the intended receiver, always delaying the transmission until the\nreceiver has acknowledged the previous particle on an authenticated classical\nchannel, restricting eavesdropping to accessing the quantum transmission one\nparticle at a time. Hence, an eavesdropper cannot undo the non-local\ntransformation perfectly. Even if perfect cloning of quantum states was\npossible the state of the group could not be cloned. We calculate the maximal\ninformation on the established key provided by an intercept-resend attack and\nthe induced disturbance for different transformations. We observe that it is\npossible to significantly reduce the eavesdropper's maximal information on the\nkey--to one eighth of that in BB84 for a fixed, reasonable amount of\ndisturbance. We also show that the individual access to the particles poses a\nfundamental restriction to the eavesdropper, and discuss a novel attack type\nagainst the proposed protocol.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Dec 2007 15:57:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-12-28"}
