We show that the available\nobservations and models put a very stringent constraint on this maximum mass\nunder the assumption that a black hole formation is required to produce a short\ngamma-ray burst in a double neutron star merger. Specifically, we find that the\nmaximum neutron star mass must be within 2 - 2.5 Msun. Moreover, a single\nunambiguous measurement of a neutron star mass above 2.5 Msun would exclude a\nblack hole -- torus central engine model of short gamma-ray bursts in double\nneutron star mergers. Such an observation would also indicate that if in fact\nshort gamma-ray bursts are connected to neutron star mergers, the gamma-ray\nburst engine is best explained by the lesser known model invoking a highly\nmagnetized massive neutron star (e.g., Usov 1992; Kluzniak & Ruderman 1998; Dai\net al. 2006; Metzger, Quataert & Thompson 2007).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2007 21:21:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Apr 2008 20:50:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We argue that every other such \"bunch\" represents photons\nthat follow trajectories with an additional orbit around the black hole at the\nphoton circular orbit radius (a photon \"echo\"). The presence of this constant\nlag in the response function of the system leads to a QPO feature in its power\ndensity spectra, even though the corresponding light curve consists of a\ntotally stochastic signal.

We have performed a cluster analysis of the local\nextrema in the CMB signal to show that the CS is actually associated with a\nlarge group of extrema rather than just one. In the light of this we have\nre-examined the properties of the WMAP ILC and co-added \"cleaned\" WCM maps,\nwhich have previously been used for the analysis of the properties of the\nsignal in the vicinity of the CS. These two maps have remarkably similar\nproperties on equal latitude rings for |b|>30deg, as well as in the vicinity of\nthe CS. We have also checked the idea that the CMB signal has a non-Gaussian\ntail, localized in the low multipole components of the signal. For each ring we\napply a linear filter with characteristic scale R, dividing the CMB signal in\ntwo parts: the filtered part, with characteristic scale above that of the\nfilter R, and the difference between the initial and filtered signal. Using the\nfilter scale as a variable, we can maximize the skewness and kurtosis of the\nsmoothed signal and minimize these statistics for the difference between\ninitial and filtered signal. We have discovered that the shape of the CS is\nformed primarily by the components of the CMB signal represented by multipoles\nbetween 10<=L<=20, with a corresponding angular scale about 5-10 degs. This\nsignal leads to modulation of the whole CMB sky, clearly seen at |b|>30deg in\nboth the ILC and WCM maps, rather than a single localized feature. After\nsubtraction of this modulation, the remaining part of the CMB signal appears to\nbe consistent with statistical homogeneity and Gaussianity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2007 11:41:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Jan 2011 10:37:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-02"}

The\nimplementation introduces the time evolution for Ly_alpha photons (a feature\ncommonly neglected in line radiative transfer codes) and, to reduce the\ncomputational time needed to follow each scattering, adopts a statistical\napproach to the Ly_alpha treatment by making extensive use of pre-compiled\ntables.

This is not surprising: as long as both galaxies and matter are\nsubject to the same force, dynamics would drive them towards tracing each\nother. This holds, for instance, in theories where both galaxies and matter\nmove on geodesics. This relaxation of bias towards unity is tempered by cosmic\nacceleration, however: the bias tends towards unity but does not quite make it,\nunless the formation bias were close to unity. Our argument is extended in a\nstraightforward manner to the case of a stochastic or nonlinear bias. An\nimportant corollary is that dynamical evolution could imprint a scale\ndependence on the large scale galaxy bias. This is especially pronounced if\nnon-standard gravity introduces new scales to the problem: the bias at\ndifferent scales relaxes at different rates, the larger scales generally more\nslowly and retaining a longer memory of the initial bias. A consistency test of\nthe current (general relativity + uniform dark energy) paradigm is therefore to\nlook for departure from a scale independent bias on large scales. A simple way\nis to measure the relative bias of different populations of galaxies which are\nat different stages of bias relaxation. Lastly, we comment on the possibility\nof directly testing the Poisson equation on cosmological scales, as opposed to\nindirectly through the growth factor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2007 15:47:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2007 18:58:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2008 22:22:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The\nessential idea is to prevent the premature condensation into few large\ncommunities.

This\nwork presents an alternative memory ordering mechanism for this architecture,\nthe Transaction WaveCache. Our mechanism maintains the execution order of\nmemory operations within blocks of code, called Waves, but adds the ability to\nspeculatively execute, out-of-order, operations from different waves. This\nordering mechanism is inspired by progress in supporting Transactional\nMemories. Waves are considered as atomic regions and executed as nested\ntransactions. If a wave has finished the execution of all its memory\noperations, as soon as the previous waves are committed, it can be committed.\nIf a hazard is detected in a speculative Wave, all the following Waves\n(children) are aborted and re-executed. We evaluate the WaveCache on a set\nartificial benchmarks. If the benchmark does not access memory often, we could\nachieve speedups of around 90%. Speedups of 33.1% and 24% were observed on more\nmemory intensive applications, and slowdowns up to 16% arise if memory\nbandwidth is a bottleneck.

The uncertainties {ui} of measuring {Xi} are generally a priori\nensured as acceptable. However, there is no general method for assessing\nuncertainty (em) in the desired Ym, i.e. irrespective of whatever might be its\nsystem-specific-relationship (SSR) with {Xi}, and/ or be the causes of {ui}. We\nhere therefore study the behaviors of different typical SSRs. The study shows\nthat any SSR is characterized by a set of parameters, which govern em. That is,\nem is shown to represent a net SSR-driven (purely systematic) change in ui(s);\nand it cannot vary for whether ui(s) be caused by either or both statistical\nand systematic reasons. We thus present the general relationship of em with\nui(s), and discuss how it can be used to predict a priori the requirements for\nan evaluated Ym to be representative, and hence to set the guidelines for\ndesigning experiments and also really appropriate evaluation models. Say: Y_m=\nf_m ({X_i}_(i=1)^N), then, although: e_m= g_m ({u_i}_(i=1)^N), \"N\" is not a key\nfactor in governing em. However, simply for varying \"fm\", the em is\ndemonstrated to be either equaling a ui, or >ui, or even <ui. Further, the\nlimiting error (d_m^(Lim.)) in determining an Ym is also shown to be decided by\n\"fm\" (SSR). Thus, all SSRs are classified into two groups: (I) the SSRs that\ncan never lead \"d_m^(Lim.)\" to be zero; and (II) the SSRs that enable\n\"d_m^(Lim.)\" to be zero. In fact, the theoretical-tool (SSR) is by pros and\ncons no different from any discrete experimental-means of a study, and has\nresemblance with chemical reactions as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2007 09:43:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2011 08:08:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2011 11:41:58 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2011 06:57:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-21"}
