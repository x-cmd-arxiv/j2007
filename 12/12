As galaxies become less biased with respect to mass\nasymptotically with time, the HOD parameters evolve such that M1/Mm decreases\nwhile alpha converges toward unity, where Mm is the characteristic halo mass to\nhost a central galaxy, M1 is the halo mass to host one satellite galaxy, and\nalpha is the power-law index in the halo-mass dependence of the average number\nof satellites per halo.

Recently, new high-resolution circular and linear polarisation\nspectroscopy has even hinted at the presence of strong, small-scale field\nstructures, which were completely unexpected based on earlier modelling. This\nproject investigates the detailed structure of these strong fossil magnetic\nfields, in particular the large-scale field geometry, as well as small scale\nmagnetic structures, by mapping the magnetic and chemical surface structure of\na selected sample of Ap stars. These maps will be used to investigate the\nrelationship between the local field vector and local surface chemistry,\nlooking for the influence the field may have on the various chemical transport\nmechanisms (i.e., diffusion, convection and mass loss).

Methods. We carried out VLA observations of the 7 mm continuum\nemission, and OVRO observations of the 2.7 mm continuum emission, CO(1-0),\nC18O(1-0), and HC3N(12-11) to map the core towards IRAS 20050+2720. The\nhigh-angular resolution of the observations allowed us to derive the properties\nof the dust emission, the molecular outflow, and the dense protostellar\nenvelope. By adding this source to the sample of intermediate-mass protostars\nwith outflows, we compare their properties and evolution with those of lower\nmass counterparts. Results. The 2.7mm continuum emission has been resolved into\nthree sources, labeled OVRO 1, OVRO 2, and OVRO 3. Two of them, OVRO 1 and OVRO\n2, have also been detected at 7 mm. OVRO 3, which is located close to the C18O\nemission peak, could be associated with IRAS 20050+2720. The mass of the\nsources, estimated from the dust continuum emission, is 6.5 Msun for OVRO 1,\n1.8 Msun for OVRO 2, and 1.3 Msun for OVRO 3. The CO(1-0) emission traces two\nbipolar outflows within the OVRO field of view, a roughly east-west bipolar\noutflow, labeled A, driven by the intermediate-mass source OVRO 1, and a\nnortheast-southwest bipolar outflow, labeled B, probably powered by a YSO\nengulfed in the circumstellar envelope surrounding OVRO 1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2007 16:34:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

A weak probe laser propagates through\none of the wells and interacts with atoms in a three-level $\\Lambda$\nconfiguration. The well through which the probe propagates is dressed by a\nstrong control laser with Rabi frequency $\\Omega_{\\mu}$, as in standard EIT\nsystems. Tunneling between the wells at the frequency $g$ provides a coherent\ncoupling between identical electronic states in the two wells, which leads to\nthe formation of inter-well dressed states. The tunneling in conjunction with\nthe macroscopic interwell coherence of the BEC wave function, results in the\nformation of two ultra-narrow absorption resonances for the probe field that\nare inside of the ordinary EIT transparency window. We show that these new\nresonances can be interpreted in terms of the inter-well dressed states and the\nformation of a novel type of dark state involving the control laser and the\ninter-well tunneling.

This is a three-stage model within the context of a\ncore-collapse supernova. STAGE 1 is an accreting (proto-) neutron star leading\nto a possible delay between the core collapse and the GRB. STAGE 2 is accretion\nonto a quark-star, launching an ultrarelativistic jet generating the prompt\nGRB. This jet also creates the afterglow as the jet interacts with the\nsurrounding medium creating an external shock. Slower shells ejected from the\nquark star (during accretion), can re-energize the external shock leading to a\nflatter segment in the X-ray afterglow. STAGE 3, which occurs only if the\nquark-star collapses to form a black-hole, consists of an accreting black-hole.\nThe jet launched in this accretion process interacts with the preceding quark\nstar jet, and could generate the flaring activity frequently seen in early\nX-ray afterglows. Alternatively, a STAGE 2b can occur in our model if the quark\nstar does not collapse to a black hole. The quark star in this case can then\nspin down due to magnetic braking, and the spin down energy may lead to\nflattening in the X-ray afterglow as well. This model seems to account for both\nthe energies and the timescales of GRBs, in addition to the newly discovered\nearly X-ray afterglow features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2007 22:49:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

Identification of neurons within such Nissl-stained sections is\ninherently difficult due to the variability in neuron staining, the overlap of\nneurons, the presence of partial or damaged neurons at tissue surfaces, and the\npresence of non-neuron objects, such as glial cells, blood vessels, and random\nartifacts. To overcome these challenges and identify neurons, ANRA applies a\ncombination of image segmentation and machine learning. The steps involve\nactive contour segmentation to find outlines of potential neuron cell bodies\nfollowed by artificial neural network training using the segmentation\nproperties (size, optical density, gyration, etc.) to distinguish between\nneuron and non-neuron segmentations. ANRA positively identifies 86[5]% neurons\nwith 15[8]% error (mean[st.dev.]) on a wide range of Nissl-stained images,\nwhereas semi-automatic methods obtain 80[7]%/17[12]%.

This pattern gives rise to an easy computation method, which we term\nback-of-the-envelop (BoE) computation, because for many network configurations,\nvery accurate results can be obtained within minutes, if not seconds, by simple\nhand computation. BoE beats prior methods in terms of both speed and accuracy.\nWhile the computation procedure of BoE is simple, explaining why it works is by\nno means trivial. Indeed the majority of our investigative efforts have been\ndevoted to the construction of a theory to explain BoE. This paper models an\nideal CSMA network as a set of interacting on-off telegraph processes. In\ndeveloping the theory, we discovered a number of analytical techniques and\nobservations that have eluded prior research, such as that the carrier-sensing\ninteractions among links in an ideal CSMA network result in a system state\nevolution that is time-reversible; and that the probability distribution of the\nsystem state is insensitive to the distributions of the \"on\" and \"off\"\ndurations given their means, and is a Markov random field.

We have developed new methods to parameterize\nthe dip to systematically study its variations. This helps to further\nunderstand binary and accretion disk behaviors. The RXTE 1998 observations\nclearly show a 4.87d periodic variation of the dip width. This is probably due\nto the nodal precession of the accretion disk, although there are no\nsignificant sidebands in the spectrum from the epoch folding search. From the\nnegative superhump model (Larwood et. al. 1996), the mass ratio can be\nestimated as q = 0.045.

The period derivative seems inconsistent with the prediction of the\nstandard model of binary orbital evolution proposed by Rappaport et. al.\n(1987). On the other hand, the radiation-driven model (Tavani et. al. 1991) may\nproperly interpret the period derivative even though the large mass outflow\npredicted by this model has never been observed in this system.

Such stars are thought to be ejected through dynamical\ninteractions near the massive black hole (MBH) in the Galactic center. Three\nscenarios have been suggested for their ejection; binary disruption by a MBH,\nscattering by inspiraling IMBH and scattering by stellar BHs close to MBH.\nThese scenarios involve different stellar populations in the Galactic center.\nHere we use observations of the Galactic center stellar population together\nwith dynamical and evolutionary arguments to obtain strong constraints on the\nnature and origin of HVSs. We show that the IMBH inspiral scenario requires too\nmany (O(10^3)) main sequence B stars to exist close to the MBH (<0.01 pc) at\nthe time of inspiral, where current observations show O(10) such stars.\nScattering by SBHs also require too many B stars to be observed in the GC, but\nit may contribute a small fraction of the currently observed HVSs. The binary\ndisruption scenario is still consistent with current observations. In addition\nit is shown that recently suggested signatures for HVSs origin such as\nhypervelocity binaries and slow rotating HVSs are much weaker than suggested\nand require too large statistics. In addition, we show that due to the\nconditions close to the MBH most binary star systems are not expected to\nsurvive for long in this region. Consequently, unique stellar populations that\nrequire long evolution in binaries are not expected to be ejected as HVSs in\nthe BHs scattering mechanisms (this may also be related to to the recently\nobserved asymmetry in the velocity distribution of HVSs).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2007 09:39:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2008 06:28:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

As genetic data becomes\nincreasingly available, investigators face a dilemma: when should data from\nother studies and population subgroups be pooled with the primary data? Pooling\nadditional samples will generally reduce the variance of the frequency\nestimates; however, used inappropriately, pooled estimates can be severely\nbiased due to population stratification. Because of this potential bias, most\ninvestigators avoid pooling, even for samples with the same ethnic background\nand residing on the same continent.

A popular\nassumption in the online auction literature is that a Poisson bidder arrival\nprocess is a reasonable approximation. This approximation underlies theoretical\nderivations, statistical models and simulations used in field studies. However,\nwhen it comes to the bid arrivals, empirical research has shown that the\nprocess is far from Poisson, with early bidding and last-moment bids taking\nplace. An additional feature that has been reported by various authors is an\napparent self-similarity in the bid arrival process. Despite the wide evidence\nfor the changing bidding intensities and the self-similarity, there has been no\nrigorous attempt at developing a model that adequately approximates bid\narrivals and accounts for these features. The goal of this paper is to\nintroduce a family of distributions that well-approximate the bid time\ndistribution in hard-close auctions. We call this the BARISTA process (Bid\nARrivals In STAges) because of its ability to generate different intensities at\ndifferent stages. We describe the properties of this model, show how to\nsimulate bid arrivals from it, and how to use it for estimation and inference.\nWe illustrate its power and usefulness by fitting simulated and real data from\neBay.com. Finally, we show how a Poisson bidder arrival process relates to a\nBARISTA bid arrival process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2007 15:58:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-12-18"}
