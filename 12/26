M5B is a 7.95-ms pulsar in a\nbinary system with a > 0.13 solar mass companion and an orbital period of 6.86\ndays. In deep HST images, no optical counterpart is detected within ~2.5 sigma\nof the position of the pulsar, implying that the companion is either a white\ndwarf or a low-mass main-sequence star. The eccentricity of the orbit (e =\n0.14) has allowed a measurement of the rate of advance of periastron: (0.0142\n+/-0.0007) degrees per year. We argue that it is very likely that this\nperiastron advance is due to the effects of general relativity, the total mass\nof the binary system then being 2.29 +/-0.17 solar masses.

In this article the measurement of the mass of the\nscalar partner of the top quark (stop) at an e+e- collider is studied. A\nrelatively light stop is motivated by attempts to explain electroweak\nbaryogenesis and can play an important role in dark matter relic density.

In 2002, DASI\nsuccessfully observed the polarization of the cosmological microwave background\nradiation. In 2003, WMAP observed the correlation of polarization with\ntemperature anisotropy at more than 10 sigma in the cosmological microwave\nbackground. From this high polarization-temperature correlation in WMAP\nobservation, we put a limit of 0.1 rad on the rotation of linear polarization\nof cosmological microwave background (CMB) propagation. Pseudoscalar-photon\ninteraction is proportional to the gradient of the pseudoscalar field. From\nphenomenological point of view, this gradient could be neutrino number\nasymmetry current, other density current, or a constant vector. In these\nsituations, Lorentz invariance or CPT may or may not effectively be violated.\nIn this paper, we review and compile various results. Better accuracy in CMB\npolarization observation is expected from PLANCK mission to be launched next\nyear. A dedicated CMB polarization observer in the future would probe this\nfundamental issue more deeply.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Dec 2007 19:43:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 Feb 2008 02:10:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

From the classical\nsolutions we obtain the behavior of quantities such as the volume expansion,\nthe shear and the characteristic volume. However the analysis of these\nquantities does not lead to any restriction on the value of the noncommutative\nparameters, $\\theta$ and $\\eta$. On the other hand, for the quantum system, one\ncan obtain, via the numerical solution of the WDW equation, the wave function\nof the universe both for commutative as well as for the noncommutative models.\nInterestingly, we find that the existence of suitable solutions of the WDW\nequation imposes bounds on the values of the noncommutative parameters.\nMoreover, the noncommutativity in the momenta leads to damping of the wave\nfunction implying that this noncommutativity can be of relevance for the\nselection of possible initial states of the early universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Dec 2007 12:15:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Jul 2008 13:48:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The splitting is defined as a composition of a variational\nintegrator with an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck flow. Assuming the exact solution and the\nsplitting are geometrically ergodic, the paper proves the discrete invariant\nmeasure of the splitting approximates the invariant measure of inertial\nLangevin to within the accuracy of the variational integrator in representing\nthe Hamiltonian. In particular, if the variational integrator admits no energy\nerror, then the method samples the invariant measure of inertial Langevin\nwithout error. Numerical validation is provided using explicit variational\nintegrators with first, second, and fourth order accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Dec 2007 04:13:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2008 14:16:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 2 Jun 2008 08:57:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 11 May 2009 21:16:53 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2010 17:49:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-05"}

There are a number of possibilities for either a Beta Beam or Super Beam\n(SB) medium energy facility between 1-5 GeV. These include a totally active\nscintillating detector (TASD), a liquid argon TPC or a water Cherenkov\ndetector.\n  3. A 100 kton magnetized iron neutrino detector (MIND) is the baseline to\ndetect the wrong sign muon final states (golden channel) at a high energy\n(20-50 GeV) neutrino factory from muon decay.
