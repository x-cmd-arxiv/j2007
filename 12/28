Next I discuss the implications of MOND for the dark matter\n(DM) doctrine: MOND's successes imply that baryons determine everything. For DM\nthis would mean that the puny tail of leftover baryons in galaxies wags the\nhefty DM dog. This has to occur in many intricate ways, and despite the\nhaphazard construction history of galaxies--a very tall order. I then\nconcentrate on galaxy clusters in light of MOND, which still requires some yet\nundetected cluster dark matter, presumably in some baryonic form (CBDM). This\nCBDM might contribute to the heating of the x-ray emitting gas and thus\nalleviate the cooling-flow puzzle. MOND, qua theory of dynamics, does not\ndirectly enter the microphysics of the gas; however, it does force a new\noutlook on the role of DM in shaping the cluster gasdynamics: MOND tells us\nthat the cluster DM is not cold dark matter, is not so abundant, and is not\nexpected in galaxies; it is thus not subject to constraints on baryonic DM in\ngalaxies. The mass in CBDM required in a whole cluster is, typically, similar\nto that in hot gas, but is rather more centrally concentrated, totally\ndominating the core. The CBDM contribution to the baryon budget in the universe\nis thus small. Its properties, deduced for isolated clusters, are consistent\nwith the observations of the ``bullet cluster''. Its kinetic-energy reservoir\nis much larger than that of the hot gas in the core, and would suffice to keep\nthe gas hot for many cooling times.

The first dogma is John Bell's assertion that\nmeasurement should never be introduced as a primitive process in a fundamental\nmechanical theory like classical or quantum mechanics, but should always be\nopen to a complete analysis, in principle, of how the individual outcomes come\nabout dynamically. The second dogma is the view that the quantum state has an\nontological significance analogous to the significance of the classical state\nas the 'truthmaker' for propositions about the occurrence and non-occurrence of\nevents, i.e., that the quantum state is a representation of physical reality.\nWe show how both dogmas can be rejected in a realist information-theoretic\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics as an alternative to the Everett\ninterpretation.

By contrast with the Bohmians and the GRW 'collapse' theorists who\nadd structure to the theory and propose dynamical solutions to the 'big'\nmeasurement problem, we take the problem to arise from the failure to see the\nsignificance of Hilbert space as a new kinematic framework for the physics of\nan indeterministic universe, in the sense that Hilbert space imposes kinematic\n(i.e., pre-dynamic) objective probabilistic constraints on correlations between\nevents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Dec 2007 17:37:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 May 2008 13:48:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-05-19"}

We find that the\nnon-perturbative and strongly out-of-equilibrium process of magnetic field\nproduction occurs along the lines predicted by Vachaspati many years ago. The\nsystem starts in the false vacuum at the end of inflation, and very quickly the\ninitial quantum fluctuations of the Higgs field get amplified via long\nwavelength spinodal instabilities. The subsequent nucleation of the random\nGaussian Higgs field bubbles (lumps) leads to EW symmetry breaking, and to the\ncreation of $Z$-strings, which soon decay, along with longwave magnetic flux\ntubes with nontrivial helicity. The intensity and scales in these helical\nmagnetic fields are consistent with their later development into the microgauss\nfields observed in galaxies and clusters of galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Dec 2007 18:22:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We designate the planet XO-3b, and the star XO-3,\nalso known as GSC 03727-01064. The orbital period of XO-3b is 3.1915426 +/-\n0.00014 days. XO-3 lacks a trigonometric distance; we estimate its distance to\nbe 260 +/- 23 pc. The radius of XO-3 is 2.13 +/- 0.21 Rsun, its mass is 1.41\n+/- 0.08 Msun, its vsini = 18.54 +/- 0.17 km/s, and its metallicity is [Fe/H] =\n-0.177 +/- 0.027. This system is unusual for a number of reasons. XO-3b is one\nof the most massive planets discovered around any star for which the orbital\nperiod is less than 10 days. The mass is near the deuterium burning limit of 13\nMjup, which is a proposed boundary between planets and brown dwarfs. Although\nBurrows et al. (2001) propose that formation in a disk or formation in the\ninterstellar medium in a manner similar to stars is a more logical way to\ndifferentiate planets and brown dwarfs, our current observations are not\nadequate to address this distinction. XO-3b is also unusual in that its\neccentricity is large given its relatively short orbital period. Both the\nplanetary radius and the inclination are functions of the spectroscopically\ndetermined stellar radius. Analysis of the transit light curve of XO-3b\nsuggests that the spectroscopically derived parameters may be over estimated.\nThough relatively noisy, the light curves favor a smaller radius in order to\nbetter match the steepness of the ingress and egress.

The\ndetection of these sources and their imaging at the high resolution and\nsensitivity achievable with SKA will greatly contribute to the comprehension of\ncrucial cosmological and astrophysical aspects, as the physical conditions of\nearly ionized halos, quasars and proto-galactic gas. The spectacular\nimprovement in our understanding of the properties of extragalactic radio\nsources at very faint fluxes achievable with SKA will allow to accurately model\ntheir contribution to the diffuse radio background, greatly contributing to the\ninterpretation of next generation of CMB spectrum experiments devoted to probe\nthe thermal plasma history at early times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Dec 2007 15:09:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

As the\nlattice spacing tends to zero, all three models are found to have the same\nscaling limit, which we describe as the solution to a certain PDE free boundary\nproblem in R^d. In particular, internal DLA has a deterministic scaling limit.\nWe find that the scaling limits are quadrature domains, which have arisen\nindependently in many fields such as potential theory and fluid dynamics. Our\nresults apply both to the case of multiple point sources and to the\nDiaconis-Fulton smash sum of domains. In the special case when all particles\nstart at a single site, we show that the scaling limit is a Euclidean ball in\nR^d, and give quantitative bounds on the rate of convergence to a ball.

Lastly, we study the sandpile group of a regular tree whose\nleaves are collapsed to a single sink vertex, and determine the decomposition\nof the full sandpile group as a product of cyclic groups. For the regular\nternary tree of height n, for example, the sandpile group is isomorphic to\n(Z_3)^{2^{n-3}} x (Z_7)^{2^{n-4}} x ... x Z_{2^{n-1}-1} x Z_{2^n-1}.
