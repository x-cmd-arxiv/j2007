This criterion captures the essence of the transition from\nthe AGB to the post AGB phase, because Q is connected to the stellar effective\ntemperature, reaching its maximum value at T~4000-6000 K, it is related to the\nmass loss properties, and it reaches its maximum value when rapid contraction\nstarts and envelope mass is very low.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Dec 2007 07:41:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

This machinery allows us to treat on an equal footing free loops in\nstacks and hidden loops. In particular, we give a good notion of a free loop\nstack, and of a mapping stack $\\map(Y,\\XX)$, where $Y$ is a compact space and\n$\\XX$ a topological stack, which is functorial both in $\\XX$ and $Y$ and\nbehaves well enough with respect to pushouts. We also construct a bivariant (in\nthe sense of Fulton and MacPherson) theory for topological stacks: it gives us\na flexible theory of Gysin maps which are automatically compatible with\npullback, pushforward and products. Further we prove an excess formula in this\ncontext. We introduce oriented stacks, generalizing oriented manifolds, which\nare stacks on which we can do string topology. We prove that the homology of\nthe free loop stack of an oriented stack and the homology of hidden loops\n(sometimes called ghost loops) are a Frobenius algebra which are related by a\nnatural morphism of Frobenius algebras. We also prove that the homology of free\nloop stack has a natural structure of a BV-algebra, which together with the\nFrobenius structure fits into an homological conformal field theories with\nclosed positive boundaries. Using our general machinery, we construct an\nintersection pairing for (non necessarily compact) almost complex orbifolds\nwhich is in the same relation to the intersection pairing for manifolds as\nChen-Ruan orbifold cup-product is to ordinary cup-product of manifolds. We show\nthat the hidden loop product of almost complex is isomorphic to the orbifold\nintersection pairing twisted by a canonical class. Finally we gave some\nexamples including the case of the classifying stacks $[*/G]$ of a compact Lie\ngroup.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Dec 2007 13:34:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2011 13:51:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-05"}
