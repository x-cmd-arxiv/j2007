A Rutherfordian atomic model is used\nassuming a circular electron orbit, without the quantum principle as imposed\narbitrarily in the Bohr model, but with an ad hoc incorporation in the electron\nof intrinsic spin and associated magnetic dipole moment. Analyzing the motions\nof the electron spin and orbital angular momenta, it is found that in the\npresence of Thomas precession, the total angular momentum averaged over the\norbit is not generally a constant of the motion. It is noted this differs from\nthe finding of Thomas in a similar assessment of 1927, and the reason for this\ndifference is provided. It is found that although the total orbit-averaged\nangular momentum is not a constant of the motion, it precesses around a fixed\naxis similarly to the precession of the total angular momentum vector seen in\nspin-orbit coupling in quantum theory. The magnitude of the angular velocity of\nthe total orbit-averaged angular momentum is seen to vanish only when the spin\nand orbital angular momenta are antiparallel and their mutual precession\nfrequencies equate. It is then found, there is a unique radius where the mutual\nprecession frequencies equate. Assuming the electron magnetic moment is the\nBohr magneton, and an electron g-factor of two, this radius corresponds to\nwhere the orbital angular momentum is the reduced Planck's constant.

This could be done in the near-IR\nobservations of Type 1 AGNs where we see directly the hottest dust grains in\nthe torus. We discuss two critical issues in such studies. Firstly, we examine\nthe nuclear point sources in the HST/NICMOS images of nearby Type 1 AGNs, to\nevaluate the possible contribution from the central putative accretion disk.\nAfter a careful subtraction of host bulge flux, we show that near-IR colors of\nthe point sources appear quite interpretable simply as a composite of a\nblack-body-like spectrum and a relatively blue distinct component as expected\nfor a torus and an accretion disk, respectively. Our radiative transfer models\nfor clumpy tori also support this simple two-component interpretation. The\nobserved near-IR colors suggest a fractional accretion disk contribution of\n~25% or less at 2.2 micron. Secondly, we show that the innermost torus radii as\nindicated by the recent near-IR reverberation measurements are systematically\nsmaller by a factor of ~3 than the predicted dust sublimation radius with a\nreasonable assumption for graphite grains of sublimation temperature 1500 K and\nsize 0.05 micron in radius. The discrepancy might indicate a much higher\nsublimation temperature or a typical grain size being much larger in the\ninnermost tori, though the former case appears to be disfavored by the observed\ncolors of the HST point sources studied above.

We point out that a major fraction of white dwarfs\ntidally captured by the black hole may be destroyed by tidal inflation during\nongoing circularisation, and the formation of tight binaries is inhibited.\nHowever, some stars may survive being spun up to high rotation rates. Then the\nenergy loss through gravitational wave emission induced by tidally excited\npulsation modes and dissipation through non linear effects may compete with the\nincrease of pulsation energy due to dynamic tides. The semi-major axes of these\nstars can be decreased below a 'critical' value where dynamic tides are not\neffective because pulsation modes retain phase coherence between successive\npericentre passages. The rate of formation of such circularising stars is\nestimated assuming that they can be modelled as $n=1.5$ polytropes and that\nresults of the tidal theory for slow rotators can be extrapolated to fast\nrotators.

It\nmakes possible to transmit information without the use of electric current and\nutilize wave interference for useful logic functionality. The basic elements\ninclude voltage-to-spin wave and wave-to-voltage converters, spin waveguides, a\nmodulator, and a magnetoelectric cell. As an example of a magnetoelectric cell,\nwe consider a two-phase piezoelectric-piezomagnetic system, where the spin wave\nsignal modulation is due to the stress-induced anisotropy caused by the applied\nelectric field. The performance of the basic elements is illustrated by\nexperimental data and results of numerical modeling.

Their Outer\nGalaxy counterparts, if present, are not easily identified because of a low or\nabsent mid-IR background. We characterize the ambient conditions in the Outer\nGalaxy IRDC candidate G111.80+0.58, a relatively quiescent molecular core\ncomplex in the vicinity of NGC7538. We conduct molecular line observations on a\nnumber of dense cores and analyze the data in terms of excitation temperature,\ncolumn and volume density, mass and stability. The temperatures (15-20K) are\nhigher than expected from only cosmic ray heating, but comparable to those\nfound in massive cores. Star forming activity could be present in some cores,\nas indicated by the presence of warm gas and YSO candidates. The observed\nsuper-thermal line-widths are typical for star forming regions. The velocity\ndispersion is consistent with a turbulent energy cascade over the observed size\nscales. We do not find a correlation between the gas temperature and the\nline-width. The LTE masses we find are much larger than the thermal Jeans mass\nand fragmentation is expected. In that case the observed lines represent the\ncombined emission of multiple unresolved components. We conclude that\nG111.80+0.58 is a molecular core complex with bulk properties very similar to\nIRDCs in an early, but not pristine, star forming state. The individual cores\nare close to virial equilibrium and some contain sufficient material to form\nmassive stars and star clusters.

The spectroscopic stellar parameters, in particular stellar-parameter\ndifferences between groups of stars, are in good agreement with broad-band and\nStroemgren photometry calibrated on the infrared-flux method. The spectroscopic\nabundance analysis reveals, for the first time, systematic trends of iron\nabundance with evolutionary stage. Iron is found to be 31% less abundant in the\nturnoff-point stars than in the red giants. An abundance difference in lithium\nis seen between the turnoff-point and warm subgiant stars. The impact of\npotential systematic errors on these abundance trends (stellar parameters, the\nhydrostatic and LTE approximations) is quantitatively evaluated and found not\nto alter our conclusions significantly. Trends for various elements (Li, Mg,\nCa, Ti and Fe) are compared with stellar-structure models including the effects\nof atomic diffusion and radiative acceleration. Such models are found to\ndescribe the observed element-specific trends well, if extra (turbulent) mixing\njust below the convection zone is introduced.

In this\ncontribution I summarize our results (Zibetti et al. 2005) obtained by stacking\nSDSS images of 683 clusters, selected with the maxBCG algorithm at 0.2< z <0.3.\nThanks to our large sample and the advantages of image stacking applied to SDSS\nimages, we are able to measure the systematic properties of the intracluster\nlight (ICL) with very high accuracy. We find that the average surface\nbrightness of the ICL ranges between 26 and 32 mag/arcsec^2, and constantly\ndeclines from 70 kpc cluster-centric distance (i.e. distance from the BCG) to\n700 kpc. The fraction of diffuse light over the total light (including\ngalaxies), monotonically declines from ~50 to <~5% over the same range of\ndistances, thus showing that the ICL is more easily produced close to the\nbottom of a cluster's potential well. Clusters lacking a bright BCG hardly\nbuild up a large amount of intracluster stellar component. The link between the\ngrowth of the BCG and the ICL is also suggested by the strong degree of\nalignment between these two components which is observed in clusters where the\nBCG displays a significant elongation. With the additional fact that the colors\nof the ICL are consistent with those of galaxies, all this appears to be\nevidence for IC stars being stripped from galaxies that suffer very strong\ntidal interactions in the center of clusters and eventually merge into the BCG.\nOur measurements also show that IC stars are a minor component of a cluster's\nbaryonic budget, representing only ~10% of the total optical emission within\n500 kpc.

At any time, given some agent's current coding capabilities, part\nof the data is compressible by a short and hopefully fast program / description\n/ explanation / world model. In the agent's subjective eyes, such data is more\nregular and more \"beautiful\" than other data. It is well-known that knowledge\nof regularity and repeatability may improve the agent's ability to plan actions\nleading to external rewards. In absence of such rewards, however, known beauty\nis boring. Then \"interestingness\" becomes the first derivative of subjective\nbeauty: as the learning agent improves its compression algorithm, formerly\napparently random data parts become subjectively more regular and beautiful.\nSuch progress in compressibility is measured and maximized by the curiosity\ndrive: create action sequences that extend the observation history and yield\npreviously unknown / unpredictable but quickly learnable algorithmic\nregularity. We discuss how all of the above can be naturally implemented on\ncomputers, through an extension of passive unsupervised learning to the case of\nactive data selection: we reward a general reinforcement learner (with access\nto the adaptive compressor) for actions that improve the subjective\ncompressibility of the growing data. An unusually large breakthrough in\ncompressibility deserves the name \"discovery\".

Here, we\ninvestigate the potential for planet formation around brown dwarfs and very low\nmass stars according to the sequential core accretion model of planet\nformation. We find that, for a brown dwarfs of mass 0.05M_{\\odot}, our models\npredict a maximum planetary mass of ~5M_{\\oplus}, orbiting with semi-major axis\n~1AU. However, we note that the predictions for the mass - semi-major axis\ndistribution are strongly dependent upon the models chosen for the disc surface\ndensity profiles and the assumed distribution of disc masses. In particular, if\nbrown dwarf disc masses are of the order of a few Jupiter masses, Earth-mass\nplanets might be relatively frequent, while if typical disc masses are only a\nfraction of Jupiter mass, we predict that planet formation would be extremely\nrare in the sub-stellar regime. As the observational constraints on disc\nprofiles, mass dependencies and their distributions are poor in the brown dwarf\nregime, we advise caution in validating theoretical models only on stars\nsimilar to the Sun and emphasise the need for observational data on planetary\nsystems around a wide range of stellar masses. We also find that, unlike the\nsituation around solar-like stars, Type-II migration is totally absent from the\nplanet formation process around brown dwarfs, suggesting that any future\nobservations of planets around brown dwarfs would provide a direct measure of\nthe role of other types of migration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2007 15:44:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

This dense network of cross-linked\nactin polymers typically exhibits a striking curvature that causes bacteria to\nmove in gently looping paths. Theoretically, tail curvature has been linked to\ndetails of motility by considering force and torque balances from a finite\nnumber of polymerizing filaments. Here we track beads coated with a prokaryotic\nactivator of actin polymerization in three dimensions to directly quantify the\ncurvature and torsion of bead motility paths. We find that bead paths are more\nlikely to have low rather than high curvature at any given time. Furthermore,\npath curvature changes very slowly in time, with an autocorrelation decay time\nof 200 seconds. Paths with a small radius of curvature, therefore, remain so\nfor an extended period resulting in loops when confined to two dimensions. When\nallowed to explore a 3D space, path loops are less evident. Finally, we\nquantify the torsion in the bead paths and show that beads do not exhibit a\nsignificant left- or right-handed bias to their motion in 3D. These results\nsuggest that paths of actin-propelled objects may be attributed to slow changes\nin curvature rather than a fixed torque.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2007 15:48:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
