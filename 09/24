Near kinematic thresholds S\nencodes nonperturbative information, while far from thresholds S can be\ncomputed with an operator product expansion (OPE). We design soft functions for\njets that serve this dual purpose, reducing to the perturbative result in the\nOPE region and to a consistent model in the nonperturbative region. We use the\nMSbar scheme, and in both regions S displays the appropriate renormalization\ngroup scale dependence. We point out that viable soft function models should\nhave a gap associated with the minimum hadronic energy deposit. This gap is\nconnected to the leading O(Lambda_QCD) renormalon ambiguity in jet event\nshapes. By defining the gap in a suitable scheme we demonstrate that the\nleading renormalon can be eliminated. This improves the convergence of\nperturbative results, and also the stability by which non-perturbative\nparameters encode the underlying soft physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2007 15:47:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

If the initial state of the system does not\nbelong entirely to the subspace in question, the restriction of the state to\nthe otherwise correctable subsystem may not remain invariant after the\napplication of noise and error correction. It is known that in the case of\ndecoherence-free subspaces and subsystems (DFSs) the condition for perfect\nunitary evolution inside the code imposes more restrictive conditions on the\nnoise process if one allows imperfect initialization. It was believed that\nthese conditions are necessary if DFSs are to be able to protect imperfectly\nencoded states from subsequent errors. By a similar argument, general OQEC\ncodes would also require more restrictive error-correction conditions for the\ncase of imperfect initialization. In this study, we examine this requirement by\nlooking at the errors on the encoded state. In order to quantitatively analyze\nthe errors in an OQEC code, we introduce a measure of the fidelity between the\nencoded information in two states for the case of subsystem encoding. A major\npart of the paper concerns the definition of the measure and the derivation of\nits properties. In contrast to what was previously believed, we obtain that\nmore restrictive conditions are not necessary neither for DFSs nor for general\nOQEC codes. This is because the effective noise that can arise inside the code\nas a result of imperfect initialization is such that it can only increase the\nfidelity of an imperfectly encoded state with a perfectly encoded one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2007 09:00:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Dec 2007 20:46:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 22 Mar 2008 18:18:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-24"}

We use two-dimensional hydrodynamical\nsimulations with adaptive mesh refinement,based on the FLASH code with improved\ntime-stepping scheme. We perform global disk simulations with sufficient\nresolution close to the planet, which is allowed to freely move throughout the\ngrid. We employ a new type of equation of state in which the gas temperature\ndepends on both the distance to the star and planet, and a simplified\ncorrection for self-gravity of the circumplanetary gas. We find that the\nmigration rate in the type III migration regime depends strongly on the gas\ndynamics inside the Hill sphere (Roche lobe of the planet) which, in turn, is\nsensitive to the aspect ratio of the circumplanetary disc. Furthermore,\ncorrections due to the gas self-gravity are necessary to reduce numerical\nartifacts that act against rapid planet migration. Reliable numerical studies\nof Type III migration thus require consideration of both the thermal andthe\nself-gravity corrections, as well as a sufficient spatial resolution and the\ncalculation of disk-planet attraction both inside and outside the Hill sphere.\nWith this proviso, we find Type III migration to be a robust mode of migration,\nastrophysically promising because of a speed much faster than in the previously\nstudied modes of migration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2007 12:59:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The system employs a double Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI)\nconfiguration in which the weak quantum signal and the strong Local Oscillator\n(LO) go through the same fiber between Alice and Bob, and are separated into\ntwo paths inside Bob's terminal. To suppress the LO leakage into the signal\npath, which is an important contribution to the excess noise, we implemented a\nnovel scheme combining polarization and frequency multiplexing, achieving an\nextinction ratio of 70dB. To further minimize the system excess noise due to\nphase drift of the double MZI, we propose that, instead of employing phase\nfeedback control, one simply let Alice remap her data by performing a rotation\noperation. We further present noise analysis both theoretically and\nexperimentally. Our calculation shows that the combined polarization and\nfrequency multiplexing scheme can achieve better stability in practice than the\ntime-multiplexing scheme, because it allows one to use matched fiber lengths\nfor the signal and the LO paths on both sides of the double MZI, greatly\nreducing the phase instability caused by unmatched fiber lengths. Our\nexperimental noise analysis quantifies the three main contributions to the\nexcess noise, which will be instructive to future studies of the GMCS QKD\nsystems. Finally, we demonstrate, under the \"realistic model\" in which Eve\ncannot control the system within Bob's terminal, a secure key rate of\n0.3bit/pulse over a 5km fiber link.

The theory points out at the\nlimitations of the weak field approximation and proposes a drift in the proper\ntime of the spacecraft outside the framework of general relativity. The theory\nyields a very accurate and precise value for the anomalous acceleration. In\nthis theory the proper time of a body is associated with the gravitational\nfrequency shift of the constituent fundamental particles of the body. The\nfrequency shift changes the energy level of the body which gets reflected in\nits relativistic mass and therefore in its motion. This change in energy level\ncauses the time like geodesics to deviate from that of the standard theoretical\nmodels. We introduce proper time in the line element of a metric theory\naccording to a fixed set of rules laid down by general relativity for\nintroducing deviation in the flat Minkowski metric. The frequency shift for\nbodies of different composition traversing different trajectories however, is\nnot the same and this gets reflected in its motion as an unmodeled anomalous\neffect. This association of proper time with the gravitational frequency shift\nof the body requires the flat Minkowski metric to deviate in different ways for\ndifferent two body systems. The solution to Pioneer anomaly given here yields\nanomalous acceleration within the limits of observational accuracy.\nGravitational redshift of light, bending of light and perihelic precession of\nplanets are within the permissible limits.

All eight bound stars are moving away from the\ncentre of the Galaxy, which implies that the stars' lifetimes are less than 2\nGyr. We thus infer that the observed HVSs are massive main sequence stars,\nrather than blue horizontal branch stars. The observations suggest that blue\nHVSs are ejected from the Galactic Centre roughly every 15 Myr. This is\nconsistent with the observed population of blue stars in extremely tight orbits\nround the central super-massive black hole (SMBH), the so-called S-stars, if we\nassume that the HVSs are produced by the breakup of binaries. One of the stars\nin such a binary is ejected at high velocities to form a HVS; the other remains\nbound to the SMBH as an S-star.\n  We further show that the one high-velocity system observed to be moving\ntowards the Galactic Centre, SDSS J172226.55+594155.9, could not have\noriginated in the Galactic Centre; rather, we identify it as a halo object.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2007 13:42:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Here, the inflaton field is\ninterpreted as the distance between two branes placed in a flux-enriched\nbackground geometry and has a Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) kinetic term. Our method\nrelies on an exact numerical integration of the inflationary power spectra\ncoupled to a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo exploration of the parameter space.

We study the accretion/star formation process, with one\naim in mind, to show that a spectrum similar to the observed AGN one can be\nproduced by the disc.

Continuous discs must be maintained in a state of\nmarginal stability for the rate of star formation to remain modest, so they\nrequire additional heating and transport of angular momentum.

In clumpy discs it is possible to account for the\nrequired accretion rate through interactions between clouds, but this model is\nunsatisfactory as its parameters are tightly constrained without any physical\njustification.

Considering\nenvironments ranging from voids, i.e., log Sigma < -0.8, to the periphery of\ngalaxy clusters, i.e., log Sigma =~ 0.8, we find no dependence of the\nrelationship between galaxy stellar mass and gas-phase oxygen abundance, along\nwith its associated scatter, on local galaxy density. However, the star-forming\ngas in galaxies shows a marginal increase in the chemical enrichment level at a\nfixed stellar mass in denser environments.

It is found that the atom stays in the lower energy level more\noften at steady state irrespective of the strength of the coherent radiation\nand thermal fluctuations entering the cavity. Moreover, a strong external\ncoherent radiation results the splitting of the line of the emission spectrum,\nwhereas the decoherence broadens the width and significantly decreases the\nheight. It is also found that the emitted radiation exhibits photon\nanti-bunching, super-Poissonian photon statistics and squeezing, despite the\npresence of the decoherence which is expected to destroy the quantum features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2007 15:44:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
