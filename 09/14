Our calculations show\nthat lines from tori and lines from thin disks share several common features.\nIn particular, at low and moderate viewing inclination angles they both have\nasymmetric double-peaked profiles with a tall, sharp blue peak and a shorter\nred peak which has an extensive red wing. At high viewing inclination angles\nthey both have very broad, asymmetric lines which can be roughly considered\nsingle-peaked. Torus and disk lines may show very different red and blue line\nwings, but the differences are due to the models for relativistic tori and\ndisks having differing inner boundary radii. Self-eclipse and lensing play some\nrole in shaping the torus lines, but they are effective only at high\ninclination angles. If inner and outer radii of an accretion torus are the same\nas those of an accretion disk, their line profiles show substantial differences\nonly when inclination angles are close to 90 degrees, and those differences\nmanifest mostly at the central regions of the lines instead of the wings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2007 18:53:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

The motivation for the proposed filters arises from\nthe possibility of avoiding the generation of certain interference and noise\nterms in a given stage that would have been present in a conventional LPIC\n(CLPIC). In the proposed filters, we achieve such avoidance of the generation\nof interference and noise terms in a given stage by simply making the diagonal\nelements of a certain matrix in that stage equal to zero. Hence, the proposed\nfilters do not require additional complexity compared to the CLPIC, and they\ncan allow achieving a certain error performance using fewer LPIC stages. We\nalso extend the proposed matrix filter solutions to a multicarrier DS-CDMA\nsystem, where we consider two types of receivers. In one receiver (referred to\nas Type-I receiver), LPIC is performed on each subcarrier first, followed by\nmulticarrier combining (MCC). In the other receiver (called Type-II receiver),\nMCC is performed first, followed by LPIC. We show that in both Type-I and\nType-II receivers, the proposed matrix filters outperform other matrix filters.\nAlso, Type-II receiver performs better than Type-I receiver because of enhanced\naccuracy of the interference estimates achieved due to frequency diversity\noffered by MCC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Sep 2007 07:56:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-09-17"}

Existing location services use node identifiers to determine the\nlocator (aka anchor) that is responsible for keeping track of a node's\nlocation. Such a strategy can be inefficient because: (i) identifiers give no\nclue on the node's mobility and (ii) locators can be far from the\nsource/destination shortest path, which increases both location delays and\nbandwidth consumption. To solve these issues, Otiy introduces a new strategy\nthat identifies nodes to play the role of locators based on the likelihood of a\ndestination to be close to these nodes- i.e., locators are identified depending\non the mobility pattern of nodes. Otiy relies on the cyclic mobility patterns\nof nodes and creates a slotted agenda composed of a set of predicted locations,\ndefined according to the past and present patterns of mobility. Correspondent\nnodes fetch this agenda only once and use it as a reference for identifying\nwhich locators are responsible for the node at different points in time. Over a\nperiod of about one year, the weekly proportion of nodes having at least 50% of\nexact location predictions is in average about 75%.

(2008, Astron. Astrophys., 478, 959-970), a resonance\ninvolving the wobble of Titan is hinted. This paper studies this scenario and\nits consequences. The first step is to build an accurate analytical model that\nwould help to find the likely resonances in the rotation of every synchronous\nbody. In this model, I take the orbital eccentricity of the body into account,\nas well as its variable inclination with respect to Saturn's equator. Then an\nanalytical study using the second fundamental model of the resonance is\nperformed to study the resonance of interest. Finally, I study the dissipative\nconsequences of this resonance. I find that this resonance may have increased\nthe wobble of Titan by several degrees. For instance, if Titan's polar momentum\nC is equal to 0.355MR_T^2 (M and R_T being respectively Titan's mass and\nradius), the wobble might be forced to 41 degrees. Thanks to an original\nformula, I find that the dissipation associated with the forced wobble might\nnot be negligible compared to the contribution of the eccentricity. I also\nsuspect that, due to the forced wobble, Titan's period of rotation may be\nsomewhat underestimated by observers. Finally, I use the analytical model\npresented in this paper to compute the periods of the free librations of the\nfour Galilean satellites as well as the Saturnian satellite Rhea. For Io and\nEuropa, the results are consistent with previous studies.

Here I\nargue that this is a misconstrual and that, on the contrary,\nobservation-selection effects, when applied to catastrophic processes, make it\nvery difficult for us to discern whether the terrestrial biosphere and\nevolutionary processes which created it are exceptional in the Milky Way or\nnot. In particular, an anthropic overconfidence bias related to the temporal\nasymmetry of evolutionary processes appears when we try to straightforwardly\nestimate catastrophic risks from the past records on Earth. This agnosticism,\nin turn, supports the validity and significance of practical astrobiological\nand SETI research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Sep 2007 14:24:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-12-30"}
