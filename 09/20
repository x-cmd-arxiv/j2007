The GSE\nplus BI yields a PDE of mixed type, elliptic before critical surfaces where the\nflow speed equals certain characteristic wave speeds are crossed and hyperbolic\nafterward. The computational difficulties are exacerbated by the locations of\nthe critical surfaces not being known in advance. To overcome these obstacles,\nwe consider a variational principle by which the GSE can be attacked by\nextremizing an action integral, with all other conserved quantities of the\nproblem explicitly included as part of the overall formulation.

This object is the first confirmed black-hole X-ray\nbinary in a globular cluster. The identification of [OIII] 5007 emission from\nthe black-hole hosting globular cluster is based on two independent fiber\nspectra obtained at the VLT with FLAMES, which cover a wavelength range of\n5000-5800 Angstrom at a spectral resolution of about 6000. In each of these\nspectra we find an emission line at 5031.2 Angstrom with an uncertainty of\nseveral tenths of an Angstrom. These are consistent with [OIII] 5007 emission\nat the 1475 +/- 7 km/s radial velocity of the globular cluster previously\ndetermined from an analysis of its absorption lines. This agreement within the\nsmall uncertainties argues strongly in favor of the interpretation of the line\nas [OIII] 5007 emission from the black-hole hosting globular cluster. We also\nfind that the emission line most likely has a velocity width of several hundred\nkm/s.

Goldreich et\nal. (2002) proposed two formation scenarios: In the first, a transient binary\nis formed, which becomes bound with the aid of dynamical friction from the sea\nof small bodies (L^2s mechanism); in the second, a binary is formed by three\nbody gravitational deflection (L^3 mechanism). Here, we accurately calculate\nthe L^2s and L^3 formation rates for sub-Hill velocities. While the L^2s\nformation rate is close to previous order of magnitude estimates, the L^3\nformation rate is about a factor of 4 smaller. For sub-Hill KBO velocities (v\n<< v_H) the ratio of the L^3 to the L^2s formation rate is 0.05 (v/v_H)\nindependent of the small bodies' velocity dispersion, their surface density or\ntheir mutual collisions. For Super-Hill velocities (v >> v_H) the L^3 mechanism\ndominates over the L^2s mechanism. Binary formation via the L^3 mechanism\ncompetes with binary destruction by passing bodies. Given sufficient time, a\nstatistical equilibrium abundance of binaries forms. We show that the frequency\nof long-lived transient binaries drops exponentially with the system's lifetime\nand that such transient binaries are not important for binary formation via the\nL^3 mechanism, contrary to Lee et al.

For the L^2s mechanism we find\nthat the typical time, transient binaries must last, to form Kuiper Belt\nbinaries (KBBs) for a given strength of dynamical friction, D, increases only\nlogarithmically with D.

Because the commute time can be computed directly from the\neigenvectors of (a symmetric version) the graph probability transition matrix,\nwe use these eigenvectors to embed the dataset in low dimensions. After\nclustering the datasets in low dimensions, coherent structures emerge that can\nbe easily interpreted. We performed an extensive evaluation of our method\ncomparing it to linear and nonlinear techniques using synthetic datasets and in\nvivo datasets. We analyzed datasets from the EBC competition obtained with\nsubjects interacting in an urban virtual reality environment. Our exploratory\napproach is able to detect independently visual areas (V1/V2, V5/MT), auditory\nareas, and language areas. Our method can be used to analyze fMRI collected\nduring ``natural stimuli''.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2007 22:56:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2008 03:05:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-16"}

The Fe-Kalpha line, therefore, is not\nrelated to the non-thermal emission but originates from Fe-rich ejecta heated\nto the high temperatures by the reverse shock.

The non-thermal X-ray,\nwhich has a power-law index of ~2.8, is likely to be synchrotron emission. A\npossible scenario to explain these morphologies and spectra is: A fast moving\nblast wave in a thin cavity of OB association collided with a dense\ninterstellar medium or cloud at the east region very recently. As the result,\nthe reverse shock in this interior decelerated, and arrived at the Fe-rich\nregion of the ejecta and heated it.

We develop a hydrodynamic\ntheory for bosonic edge modes inspired by this model. The constriction region\nsplits the incident long-wavelength chiral edge density-wave excitations among\nthe transmitting and reflecting edge states encircling it. The competition\nbetween two interedge tunneling processes taking place inside the constriction,\nrelated by a quasiparticle-quasihole (qp-qh) symmetry, is accounted for by\ncomputing the boundary theories of the system. This competition is found to\ndetermine the strong coupling configuration of the system.

Based on this effect, we for the first time suggest a\nphysical explanation of the interpulse emission observed in the profiles of\nsome pulsars.

We aim to identify whether an\nembedded Keplerian protoplanetary disk resides in the L1489 IRS system. Given\nthe amount of envelope material still present, such a disk would respresent a\nvery young example of a protoplanetary disk. Using the Submillimeter Array\n(SMA) we have observed the HCO$^+$ $J=$ 3--2 line with a resolution of about\n1$''$. At this resolution a protoplanetary disk with a radius of a few hundred\nAUs should be detectable, if present.

Methods: We combine\nmulti-wavelength observations with a 2D radiative transfer study. Our radial\nvelocity program studies the central stars, while our Spitzer spectra and\nbroad-band SEDs are used to constrain mineralogy, grain sizes and physical\nstructure of the circumstellar environment. Results: We determine the orbital\nelements of RUCen showing that the orbit is highly eccentric with a rather long\nperiod of 1500 days. The infrared spectra of both objects are very similar and\nthe spectral dust features are dominated by Mg-rich crystalline silicates. The\nsmall peak-to-continuum ratios are interpreted as being due to large grains.\nOur model contains two components with a cold midplain dominated by large\ngrains, and the near- and mid-IR which is dominated by the emission of smaller\nsilicates.

Conclusions: These two prototypical RVTauri\npulsators with circumstellar dust are binaries where the dust is trapped in a\nstable disc. The mineralogy and grain sizes show that the dust is highly\nprocessed, both in crystallinity and grain size. The cool crystals show that\neither radial mixing is very efficient and/or that the thermal history at grain\nformation has been very different from that in outflows.

Such carbon stars probably belong to the intermediate-age\npopulation (2-8 Gyr old and metallicity of [Fe/H] -1) of Fornax. The primary\naim of this paper is to investigate mass-loss rate, as a function of luminosity\nand metallicity, by comparing AGB stars in several galaxies with different\nmetallicities. The spectra of three stars are fitted with a radiative transfer\nmodel. We find that mass-loss rates of these three stars are 4-7x10^-6 Msun\nyr-1. The other two stars have mass-loss rates below 1.3x10^-6 Msun yr-1. We\nfind no evidence that these rates depend on metallicity, although we do suggest\nthat the gas-to-dust ratio could be higher than at solar metallicity, in the\nrange 240 to 800. The C2H2 bands are stronger at lower metallicity because of\nthe higher C/O ratio. In contrast, the SiC fraction is reduced at low\nmetallicity, due to low silicon abundance. The total mass-loss rate from all\nknown carbon-rich AGB stars into the interstellar medium of this galaxy is of\nthe order of 2x10^-5 Msun yr-1. This is much lower than that of the dwarf\nirregular galaxy WLM, which has a similar visual luminosity and metallicity.\nThe difference is attributed to the younger stellar population of WLM.

The algorithm of image processing\nutilises a nonparametric statistical criterion that identifies a straight-line\nsegment as a linear feature (lineament) if the photospheric brightness at a\ncertain distance from this line is on both sides stochastically lower or higher\nthan at the line itself. Curvilinear features can be detected as chains of\nlineaments, using a criterion modified in some way. Once the input parameters\nused by the algorithm are properly adjusted, the algorithm highlights\n``ridges'' and ``trenches'' in the relief of the brightness field, drawing\nwhite and dark lanes. The most remarkable property of the trenching patterns is\na nearly-universally-present parallelism of ridges and trenches. Since the\nmaterial upflows are brighter than the downflows, the alternating parallel\nlight and dark lanes should reflect the presence of roll convection in the\nsubphotospheric layers. If the numerous images processed by us are\nrepresentative, the patterns revealed suggest a widespread occurrence of roll\nconvection in the outer solar convection zone. In particular, the roll systems\ncould form the fine structure of larger-scale, supergranular and/or\nmesogranular convection flows. Granules appear to be overheated blobs of\nmaterial that could develop in convection rolls due to some instabilities of\nroll motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2007 15:06:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-19"}

The polarization across the broad H\nalpha, H beta, and He I 5876 lines of SN 1997eg forms closed loops when viewed\nin the Stokes q-u plane. Such loops occur when the geometrical symmetry of one\nor both of the Stokes parameters across spectral lines is broken, in this case\nmost likely by occultation of the ejecta by the equatorial circumstellar matter\nconcentration. The polarization of the narrow Balmer lines possesses an\nintrinsic axis that differs by 12 degrees from that of the elongated ejecta and\nprobably indicates the orientation of the disk-like circumstellar material. The\nexistence of two different axes of symmetry in SN 1997eg suggests that neither\nrotation of the progenitor nor the influence of a companion star can be the\nsole mechanism creating a preferred axis within the supernova system. Our model\nsupports the emerging hypothesis that the progenitors of some Type IIn\nsupernovae are luminous blue variable stars, whose pre-supernova mass eruptions\nform the circumstellar shells that physically characterize the SN IIn subclass.\nThese conclusions, which are independent of interstellar polarization effects,\nwould have been unobservable with only a single epoch of spectropolarimetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2007 15:51:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 Aug 2008 23:53:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-18"}
