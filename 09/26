Such equations are ubiquitous in string\nfield theory and have recently attracted considerable interest also from\ncosmologists. Though these equations have been studied in the classical\nmathematical literature, it appears that the physics community is largely\nunaware of the relevant formalism. Of particular importance is the fate of the\ninitial value problem. Under what circumstances do infinite order differential\nequations possess a well-defined initial value problem and how many initial\ndata are required? In this paper we study the initial value problem for\ninfinite order differential equations in the mathematical framework of the\nformal operator calculus, with analytic initial data. This formalism allows us\nto handle simultaneously a wide array of different nonlocal equations within a\nsingle framework and also admits a transparent physical interpretation. We show\nthat differential equations of infinite order do not generically admit\ninfinitely many initial data. Rather, each pole of the propagator contributes\ntwo initial data to the final solution. Though it is possible to find\ndifferential equations of infinite order which admit well-defined initial value\nproblem with only two initial data, neither the dynamical equations of p-adic\nstring theory nor string field theory seem to belong to this class. However,\nboth theories can be rendered ghost-free by suitable definition of the action\nof the formal pseudo-differential operator. This prescription restricts the\ntheory to frequencies within some contour in the complex plane and hence may be\nthought of as a sort of ultra-violet cut-off.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2007 16:55:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2007 19:33:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2008 20:36:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-19"}

We construct a theoretical model for\nthe early chemical enrichment history of the Milky Way, aiming in particular at\nthe contribution from pair-instability supernovae (PISNe). These are a natural\nconsequence of current theoretical models for primordial star formation at the\nhighest masses. However, no metal-poor star displaying the distinct PISN\nsignature has yet been observed. We here argue that this apparent absence of\nany PISN signature is due to an observational selection effect. Whereas most\nsurveys traditionally focus on the most metal-poor stars, we predict that early\nPISN enrichment tends to `overshoot', reaching enrichment levels of [Ca/H] ~=\n-2.5 that would be missed by current searches. We utilize existing\nobservational data to place constraints on the primordial initial mass function\n(IMF).

We adopted as a fiducial model the Lambda Warm Dark Matter cosmology\nwith a non-thermal sterile neutrino mass of 0.5 keV. The filtering mass\ncorresponds then to M_f = 2.6x10^12 M_sun/h. Halos of masses close to M_f were\nsimulated with several million of particles. The results show that, on one\nhand, the inner density slope of these halos (at radii <~0.02 the virial radius\nRvir) is systematically steeper than the one corresponding to the NFW fit or to\nthe CDM counterpart. On the other hand, the overall density profile (radii\nlarger than 0.02Rvir) is less curved and less concentrated than the NFW fit,\nwith an outer slope shallower than -3. For simulations with v_rms, the inner\nhalo density profiles flatten significantly at radii smaller than 2-3 kpc/h\n(<~0.010-0.015Rvir). A constant density core is not detected in our\nsimulations, with the exception of one halo for which the flat core radius is\n~1 kpc/h.

A reduction of v_rms by a factor of 3\nproduces a modest decrease in core radii, less than a factor of 1.5.

In this paper, we\nfirst provide a joint source and channel coding approach in estimating Gaussian\nsources over Gaussian MAC channels, as well as its sufficient and necessary\ncondition in restoring Gaussian sources with a prescribed distortion value. An\ninteresting relationship between our proposed joint approach with a more\nstraightforward separate source and channel coding scheme is then established.\nWe then formulate constrained power minimization problems and transform them to\nrelaxed convex geometric programming problems, whose numerical results exhibit\nthat either separate or uncoded scheme becomes dominant over a linear topology\nnetwork. In addition, we prove that the optimal decoding order to minimize the\ntotal transmission powers for both source and channel coding parts is solely\nsubject to the ranking of MAC channel qualities, and has nothing to do with the\nranking of measurement qualities. Finally, asymptotic results for homogeneous\nnetworks are obtained which not only confirm the existing optimality of the\nuncoded approach, but also show that the asymptotic SNR exponents of these\nthree approaches are all the same. Moreover, the proposed joint approach share\nthe same asymptotic ratio with respect to high SNR and high SMNR as the uncoded\nscheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2007 21:01:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-09-27"}

Moreover,\nthe presence of atmospheric water in abundance is fully consistent with all the\n{\\it Spitzer} data for the measured planets. For planets with stratospheres,\nwater absorption features invert into emission features and mid-infrared fluxes\ncan be enhanced by a factor of two. In addition, the character of near-infrared\nplanetary spectra can be radically altered. We derive a correlation between the\nimportance of such stratospheres and the stellar flux on the planet, suggesting\nthat close-in EGPs bifurcate into two groups: those with and without\nstratospheres. From the finding that TrES-1 shows no signs of a stratosphere,\nwhile HD 209458b does, we estimate the magnitude of this stellar flux\nbreakpoint. We find that the heat redistribution parameter, P$_n$, for the\nfamily of close-in EGPs assumes values from $\\sim$0.1 to $\\sim$0.4. This paper\nprovides a broad theoretical context for the future direct characterization of\nEGPs in tight orbits around their illuminating stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2007 05:09:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Jan 2008 02:19:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

For the Orion Nebula Cluster\n(ONC) there is a binary frequency of ~ 50% for solar-mass stars compared to\n70-100% for the massive O- and B-stars. We explore the reasons for this\ndiscrepancy and come up with two possible answers: a) a primordially higher\nbinarity of massive stars could be inherent to the star formation process or b)\nthe primordial binary rate might be the same for solar-mass and massive stars,\nbut the higher capture cross section of the massive stars possibly leads to the\nformation of additional massive binaries in the early cluster development. Here\nwe investigate the likelihood of the latter using the ONC as an example. N-body\nsimulations are performed to track the capture events in an ONC-like cluster.\nWe find that whereas low-mass stars rarely form bound systems through capture,\nthe dynamics of the massive stars - especially in the first 0.5 Myrs - is\ndominated by a rapid succession of ``transient binary or multiple systems''. In\nobservations the transient nature of these systems would not be apparent, so\nthat they would be rated as binaries. At 1-2 Myrs, the supposed age of the ONC,\nthe ``transient'' massive systems become increasingly stable, lasting on\naverage several 10^6 yrs. Despite the ONC being so young, the observed binary\nfrequency for massive stars -- unlike that of solar-mass stars -- is not\nidentical to the primordial binary frequency but is increased by at least\n10-15% through dynamical interaction processes. This value might be increased\nto at least 20-25% by taking disc effects into account. The primordial binary\nfrequency could well be the same for massive and solar mass stars because the\nobserved difference can be explained by capture processes alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2007 07:49:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

They provide the key to the understanding of many\nfundamental properties of superconductors and are the basis for most bulk and\ndevice applications of these materials. In superconducting rings the electrical\ncurrent has been known to periodically respond to a magnetic flux with a\nperiodicity of $\\bm{h/2e}$. Here, the ratio of Planck's constant and the\nelementary charge defines the magnetic flux quantum $\\bm{h/e}$.

We analyse the effects of a first generation of fast rotating massive\nstars on the dynamical and chemical properties of globular clusters.

We propose that stars with high Na and low O abundances (hereafter\nanomalous stars) are formed from matter made of slow winds of individual\nmassive stars and of interstellar matter. The proportion of slow wind and of\ninterstellar material is fixed in order to reproduce the observed Li-Na\nanticorrelation in NGC 6752. Results. In the case that globular clusters,\nduring their lifetime, did not lose any stars, we found that to reproduce the\nobserved ratio of normal to anomalous stars, a flat initial mass function (IMF)\nis needed, with typically a slope x=0.55 (a Salpeter's IMF has x=1.35). In the\ncase that globular clusters suffer from an evaporation of normal stars, the IMF\nslope can be steeper: to have x=1.35, about 96% of the normal stars would be\nlost.

These results are\nsusceptible of encouraging further theoretical and experimental research in the\nproperties of these compounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2007 14:56:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2007 06:21:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
