We present line intensities and the physical conditions and\nthe abundances of He, O, Ne, N, S and Ar are derived, using the classical\nT_e-based method. We confirm our previous identification of PNe and HII regions\nbased on photometry, except for one object that we argue is a compact HII\nregion rather than a PN. We find that the chemical composition of the ISM in\nNGC 3109, as sampled by its HII regions, is remarkably uniform. The oxygen\nabundance is log O/H + 12 = 7.77 \\pm 0.07 in this galaxy, as compared to 8.05\n\\pm 0.09 for the SMC. PNe show significantly higher oxygen abundances in NGC\n3109: log O/H + 12 = 8.16 \\pm 0.19. We argue that, similarly to what has been\nsuggested for some of the PNe in the Magellanic Clouds and other metal-poor\ngalaxies, oxygen in the PNe in NGC 3109 is affected by dredge up in their\nprogenitors. This could be also the case for neon. From our analysis, we\nconclude that these two elements are not always a safe indicator of the\nchemical composition of the ISM at low metallicities. An alternative to the O\nand Ne enrichment in PNe is that the low metallicity in HII regions has been\ncaused by dilution of the ISM due interaction with a neighbor galaxy about a\nGyr ago.\n  The excitation patterns of the PNe in NGC 3109 are very different from the\nexcitation patterns of PNe in other galaxies. This would imply that the\nevolution of PNe depends upon the properties of their progenitor stellar\npopulations, which vary from galaxy to galaxy. This should affect the PN\nluminosity function and its use as a distance indicator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2007 19:42:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2007 16:13:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The radio brightness\nof the jet suggests strong interaction with the ISM and hence a location near\nthe disk plane. We observed NGC 7479 at four wavelengths with the VLA and\nEffelsberg radio telescopes. The equipartition strength is 35-40 micro-G for\nthe total and >10 micro-G for the ordered magnetic field in the jet. The jet\nacts as a bright, polarized background. Faraday rotation between 3.5 and 6 cm\nand depolarization between 6 and 22 cm can be explained by magneto-ionic gas in\nfront of the jet, with thermal electron densities of ~0.06 cm**(-3) in the bar\nand ~0.03 cm**(-3) outside the bar. The regular magnetic field along the bar\npoints toward the nucleus on both sides. The regular field in the disk reveals\nmultiple reversals, probably consisting of field loops stretched by a shearing\ngas flow in the bar. The projection of the jet bending in the sky plane is in\nthe sense opposite to that of the underlying stellar and gaseous spiral\nstructure. The bending in 3-D is most easily explained as a precessing jet,\nwith an age less than 10**6 years. Our observations are consistent with very\nrecent triggering, possibly by a minor merger.

There is a phase ambiguity that makes it\nimpossible to uniquely determine the magnitudes and relative phase of the Dirac\nand Pauli couplings from the unpolarized angular distributions alone; we show\nin detail how this can be resolved through a study of the polarized reactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2007 20:10:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Jan 2008 21:27:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Compared to a simple two-temperature fit,\nwe obtain a better and more physical description of the spectra using a model\nthat involves a continuous range of temperatures in each spatial bin.

In addition to\nstripping activity we find evidence for past accretion events. H79b (NGC6027)\nshows a strong counter-rotating emission line component interpreted as an\naccreted dwarf spiral. H79a shows evidence for an infalling component of gas\nrepresenting feedback or possible cross fueling by H79d. The biggest challenge\nto this scenario involves the low gas fraction in the group. If SS formed from\nnormal field spirals then much of the gas is missing. Finally, despite its\nadvanced stage of evolution, we find no evidence for major mergers and infer\nthat SS (and SQ) are telling us that such groups coalesce via slow dissolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2007 00:15:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

Two\nweeks after optical maximum, the X-ray spectrum was hard and dominated by\nemission lines of H-like and He-like ions. The X-ray luminosity was 2.4 x 10^36\nerg s^-1 in the 0.33-10 keV range. The spectra indicate a collisionally\ndominated plasma with a broad range of temperatures. All the lines are\nblue-shifted, with the velocity shift increasing with lower ionization state\nand longer wavelength. Two weeks later, the spectrum was still dominated by\nemission lines, although the line ratios present indicate cooling. During this\nobservation, a soft X-ray flare occurred in which a new system of higher\nvelocity emission lines appeared in the soft end of the spectrum. The dominant\ncomponent during the third month was the supersoft continuum with the broad\nabsorption features of a hot white dwarf atmosphere. A preliminary model fit\nindicates a white dwarf temperature slightly exceeding 800,000 K. The X-ray\nluminosity reached at least 9 x 10^37 erg s^-1 in the 0.2-1 keV range, while\nthe intrinsic nebular absorption decreased by a factor of five since the first\nobservation.

NGC 4254, which has an almost face-on orientation, is located\nin the outskirts of the Virgo cluster. Since such extended emission is uncommon\nin low inclination galaxies, we believe it is a signature of magnetised plasma\npushed out of the disk by ram pressure of the intracluster medium as NGC 4254\nfalls into the Virgo cluster. The detailed spectral index distribution across\nNGC 4254 shows that the steepest spectrum alpha < -1 (S propto nu^{alpha})\narises in the gas beyond the optical disk. This lends support to the ram\npressure scenario by indicating that the extended emission is not from the disk\ngas but from matter which has been stripped by ram pressure. The steeper\nspectrum of the extended emission is reminiscent of haloes in edge-on galaxies.\nThe sharp fall in intensity and enhanced polarization in the south of the\ngalaxy, in addition to enhanced star formation reported by others provide\nevidence towards the efficacy of ram pressure on this galaxy.

We then\nstudied its dynamical state with a detailed 2D temperature and surface\nbrightness analysis of the inner part of the cluster. Using the assumption of\nboth spherical symmetry and hydrostatic equilibrium (HE) we can determine the\nmain cluster parameters: total mass, temperature profile, surface brightness\nprofile and $\\beta$-parameter.

These various total mass\nestimates are consistent with each other. The temperature perturbations are\nclear signatures of ongoing merger activity. We also find significant residuals\nafter subtracting the emissivity map by a 2D $\\beta$-model fit. We conclude\nthat, although CL0016+16 shows clear signs of merger activity and departure\nfrom spherical symmetry in the centre, its X-ray emissivity can be detected up\nto $R_{200}$ and the corresponding mass $M_{200}$ can be computed directly. It\nis therefore a good candidate to study cosmological scaling laws as predicted\nby the theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2007 09:35:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The integral flux above 580 GeV is (9.4 +- 1.5 {stat} +- 1.9\n{syst}) x 10^{-13} cm^{-2} s^{-1}, corresponding to ~1.8% of the flux observed\nfrom the Crab Nebula.

Either\nmassive AGB envelopes subject to hot bottom burning, or the envelopes of\nmassive fastly rotating stars could be the progenitors. In both cases, the\nstars showing chemical anomalies must have also enhanced helium abundance, and\nwe have proposed that this higher helium could be at the basis of the many\ndifferent morphologies of GC horizontal branches (HB) for similar ages and\nmetallicities. The helium variations have been beautifully confirmed by the\nsplitting of the main sequence in the clusters omega Cen and NGC 2808, but this\neffect can show up only for somewhat extreme helium abundances. Therefore it is\nimportant to go on using the HB morphology to infer the number ratio of the\nfirst to the second generation in as many clusters as possible. We exemplify\nhow it is possible to infer the presence of a He-rich stellar component in\ndifferent clusters thanks to different HB features (gaps, RR Lyr periods and\nperiod distribution, ratio of blue to red stars, blue tails). In many clusters\nat least 50% of the stars belong to the second stellar generation, and in some\ncases we suspect that the stars might all belong to the second generation. We\nshortly examine the problem of the initial mass function required to achieve\nthe observed number ratios and conclude that: 1) the initial cluster must have\nbeen much more massive than today's cluster, and 2) formation of the second\nstellar generation mainly in the central regions of the cluster may help in\nobtaining the desired values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2007 12:46:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

For benchmarking purposes we compare the VCA results with\nexact results available from the Bethe ansatz, with essentially exact dynamical\nDMRG data, with (cellular) dynamical mean-field theory and full diagonalization\nof isolated Hubbard chains. Several issues are discussed including convergence\nof the results with cluster size, the ability of cluster approaches to access\nthe critical regime of the Mott transition, efficiency in the optimization of\ncorrelated-site vs. bath-site parameters and of multi-dimensional parameter\noptimization. We also study the role of bath sites for the description of\nexcitation properties and as charge reservoirs for the description of filling\ndependencies. The VCA turns out to be a computationally cheap method which is\ncompetitive with established cluster approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2007 14:28:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2007 09:28:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2007 14:02:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-30"}

We present a detailed description of the spectral split\nphenomenon which is conceptually and quantitatively understood in an adiabatic\ntreatment of neutrino-neutrino effects. Central to this theory is a\nself-consistency condition in the form of two sum rules (integrals over the\nneutrino spectra that must equal certain conserved quantities). We provide\nexplicit analytic and numerical solutions for various neutrino spectra. We\nintroduce the concept of the adiabatic reference frame and elaborate on the\nrelative adiabatic evolution. Violating adiabaticity leads to the spectral\nsplit being \"washed out\". The sharpness of the split appears to be represented\nby a surprisingly universal function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2007 15:58:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
