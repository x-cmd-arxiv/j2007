In 2001, the\nHubble Space Telescope Key Project (HSTKP) on the distance scale made an\nextensive analysis of earlier results and adopted the reasonable conclusion\nthat the distance modulus is 18.50+-0.10 mag, and the community has generally\naccepted this widely popularized value.

We pursue\na large-scale follow-up survey to identify and characterise the PCEBs among the\nWDMS binaries that have been found with SDSS. We use a two-step strategy with\nthe identification of PCEBs among WDMS in the first and orbital period\ndeterminations in the second phase. Here we present first results of our\nVLT/FORS2 pilot-study that has the target of identifying the PCEBs among the\nfainter (g>~18.5) SDSS-WDMS. From published SDSS catalogues we selected 26 WDMS\ntargets to be observed with VLT/FORS2. Using a spectral decomposition/fitting\ntechnique we determined the white dwarf effective temperatures and surface\ngravities, masses, and secondary star spectral types for all WDMS in our\nsample. We used the NaI 8183.27,8194.81 doublet to measure radial velocity\nvariations of our targets and performed additional follow-up spectroscopy using\nMagellan-Clay/LDSS3 of two systems showing significant radial velocity\nvariations. Among the 26 WDMS systems we find 9 strong PCEB candidates showing\nclear (>=3sigma) radial velocity variations and we estimate the fraction of\nPCEBs among SDSS WDMS to be ~35%. We find indications for a dependence of the\nrelative number of PCEBs among SDSS-WDMS on the spectral type of the secondary\nstar. These results are subject to small number statistics and need to be\nconfirmed by additional observations.

The first\nevidence for \"supersolidity\", its analogue in quantum solids, came from recent\ntorsional oscillator (TO) measurements involving 4-He. At temperatures below\n200 mK, TO frequencies increased, suggesting that some of the solid decoupled\nfrom the oscillator. This behavior has been replicated by several groups but\nsolid 4-He does not respond to pressure differences and persistent currents and\nother signatures of superflow have not been seen. Both experiments and theory\nindicate that defects are involved. These should also affect the solid's\nmechanical behavior and so we have measured the shear modulus of solid 4-He at\nlow frequencies and strains. We observe large increases below 200 mK, with the\nsame dependence on measurement amplitude, 3-He impurity concentration and\nannealing as the decoupling seen in TO experiments. This unusual elastic\nbehavior is explained in terms of a dislocation network which is pinned by 3-He\nat the lowest temperatures but becomes mobile above 100 mK.

The key idea is to\nreformulate an intractable estimation problem as one defined on a more\ntractable graph, but subject to additional constraints. Relaxing these\nconstraints gives a tractable dual problem, one defined by a thin graph, which\nis then optimized by an iterative procedure. When this iterative optimization\nleads to a consistent estimate, one which also satisfies the constraints, then\nit corresponds to an optimal MAP estimate of the original model. Otherwise\nthere is a ``duality gap'', and we obtain a bound on the optimal solution.\nThus, our approach combines convex optimization with dynamic programming\ntechniques applicable for thin graphs. The popular tree-reweighted max-product\n(TRMP) method may be seen as solving a particular class of such relaxations,\nwhere the intractable graph is relaxed to a set of spanning trees. We also\nconsider relaxations to a set of small induced subgraphs, thin subgraphs (e.g.\nloops), and a connected tree obtained by ``unwinding'' cycles. In addition, we\npropose a new class of multiscale relaxations that introduce ``summary''\nvariables. The potential benefits of such generalizations include: reducing or\neliminating the ``duality gap'' in hard problems, reducing the number or\nLagrange multipliers in the dual problem, and accelerating convergence of the\niterative optimization procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2007 21:29:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-02"}

The Lorentz force drastically alters the statistics of the\nturbulent fluctuations of the flow and reduces their amplitude. As a result\nmuch longer burst (on-phases) are observed than what is expected based on the\namplitude of the fluctuations in the kinematic regime of the dynamo. For large\nReynolds numbers, the duration time of the ``On'' phase follows a power law\ndistribution, while for smaller Reynolds numbers the Lorentz force completely\nkills the noise and the system transits from a chaotic state into a ``laminar''\ntime periodic flow. The behavior of the On-Off intermittency as the Reynolds\nnumber is increased is also examined. The connections with dynamo experiments\nand theoretical modeling are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Sep 2007 10:41:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-02"}
