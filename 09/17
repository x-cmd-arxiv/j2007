This\nrepresents an improvement over previous analyses of the Lya forest from\nhigh-resolution spectra in this redshift interval of a factor of two in the\nsize of the data set alone. We pay particular attention to robust error\nestimation and extensively test for systematic effects. We find that our\nestimates of the quasar continuum levels in the Lya forest obtained by spline\nfitting are systematically biased low, with the magnitude of the bias\nincreasing with redshift, but that this bias can be accounted for using mock\nspectra. The mean fractional error is <1% at z=2, 4% at z=3, and 12% at z=4.\nPrevious measurements of tau_eff at z>~3 based on directly fitting the quasar\ncontinua in the Lya forest, which have generally neglected this effect, are\ntherefore likely biased low. We provide estimates of the level of absorption\narising from metals in the Lya forest based on both direct and statistical\nmetal removal results in the literature, finding that this contribution is\n~6-9% at z=3 and decreases monotonically with redshift. The high precision of\nour measurement, attaining 3% in redshift bins of width Delta z=0.2 around z=3,\nindicates significant departures from the best-fit power-law redshift evolution\n(tau_eff=0.0018(1+z)^3.92, when metals are left in), particularly near z=3.2.\nThe observed downward departure is statistically consistent with a similar\nfeature detected in a precision statistical measurement using Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey spectra by Bernardi and coworkers using an independent approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2007 03:20:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2007 20:12:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 25 Jul 2008 20:17:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

An\nasymptotic expansion of this wave function at large interparticle distances is\nderived, from which is defined a quantity $D$ named three-body scattering\nhypervolume, which is an analog of the two-body scattering length. Given any\nfinite-range interaction potentials, one can thus predict the effective\nthree-body force from a numerical solution of the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation. In\nthis way the constant $D$ for hard-sphere bosons is computed, leading to the\ncomplete result for the ground state energy per particle of a dilute\nBose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of hard spheres to order $\\rho^2$, where $\\rho$\nis the number density. Effects of $D$ are also demonstrated in the three-body\nenergy in a finite box of size $L$, which is expanded to the order $L^{-7}$,\nand in the three-body scattering amplitude in vacuum. Another key prediction is\nthat there is a violation of the effective field theory (EFT) in the condensate\nfraction in dilute BECs, caused by short-range physics. EFT predictions for the\nground state energy and few-body scattering amplitudes, however, are\ncorroborated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2007 06:08:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-27"}

We investigate the performance of a\nnulling interferometer optimised for the detection of exozodiacal discs at Dome\nC, on the high Antarctic plateau, and compare it to the expected performance of\nsimilar instruments at temperate sites. Based on the currently available\nmeasurements of the turbulence characteristics at Dome C, we adapt the GENIEsim\nsoftware (Absil et al. 2006, A&A 448) to simulate the performance of a nulling\ninterferometer on the high Antarctic plateau.

The\ncalculation of the chiral (8,2) SWSi_0.15C_0.85NT system gives a similar (0.6\neV) direct band gap. The regular distribution of Si atoms in the atomic lattice\nis by ~0.1 eV/atom energetically preferable in comparison with a random\ndistribution. Time dependent DFT calculations showed that the silicon\nsubstitution sufficiently increases (roughly by one order of magnitude) the\ntotal probability of optical transitions in the near infrared region, which is\ncaused by the opening of the direct band gap in metallic SWCNTs, the\nunification of the nature and energy of band gaps of all SWCNT species, the\nlarge values of <Si3p|r|Si3s> radial integrals and participation of Si3d states\nin chemical bonding in both valence and conductance bands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2007 10:02:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2007 13:08:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-09-18"}

However, solid state astrochemical\nlaboratory data on reactions of H-atoms with common interstellar ice\nconstituents are largely lacking. Aims: The goal of our laboratory work is to\ndetermine whether and how carbon dioxide (CO2), formic acid (HCOOH) and\nacetaldehyde (CH3CHO) react with H-atoms in the solid state at low temperatures\nand to derive reaction rates and production yields. Methods: Pure CO2, HCOOH\nand CH3CHO interstellar ice analogues are bombarded by H-atoms in an ultra-high\nvacuum experiment. The ices are monitored by reflection absorption infrared\nspectroscopy and the reaction products are detected in the gas phase through\ntemperature programmed desorption to determine the destruction and formation\nyields as well as the corresponding reaction rates. Results: Within the\nsensitivity of our set-up we conclude that H-atom bombardment of pure CO2 and\nHCOOH ice does not result in detectable reaction products. The upper limits on\nthe reaction rates are less or equal to 7e(-17) cm^2/s which make it unlikely\nthat these species play a major role in the formation of more complex organics\nin interstellar ices due to reactions with H-atoms. In contrast, CH3CHO does\nreact with H-atoms. At most 20% is hydrogenated to ethanol (C2H5OH) and a\nsecond reaction route leads to the break-up of the C-C bond to form solid state\nCH4 (~20%) as well as H2CO and CH3OH (15-50%). The methane production yield is\nexpected to be equal to the summed yield of H2CO and CH3OH and therefore CH4\nmost likely evaporates partly after formation due to the high exothermicity of\nthe reaction. The reaction rates for CH3CHO destruction depend on ice\ntemperature and not on ice thickness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2007 12:09:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Analytic\nexpressions for the derivative of the basis functions permit the evaluation of\nelastic and hydrodynamic stresses and bending forces at specified grid points\nin the membrane. Compared to methods employing a triangulation scheme, this\nmethod has the advantage that the resulting capsule shapes are automatically\nsmooth, and few modes are needed to describe the deformation accurately.\nComputations are performed for capsules both with spherical and ellipsoidal\nunstressed reference shape. Results for small deformations of initially\nspherical capsules coincide with analytic predictions. For initially\nellipsoidal capsules, recent approximative theories predict stable oscillations\nof the tank-treading inclination angle, and a transition to tumbling at low\nshear rate.

In\nthis master's thesis, we have studied one particular power-saving technique,\ni.e. frequency scaling. In particular, we analysed the close relationship\nbetween clock frequencies in a microcontroller and several types of constraints\nimposed on these frequencies, e.g. by other components of the microcontroller,\nby protocol specifications, by external factors etc. Among these constraints,\nwe were especially interested in the ones imposed by the timer service and by\nthe serial ports' transmission rates. Our efforts resulted in a microcontroller\nconfiguration management tool which aims at assisting application programmers\nin choosing microcontroller configurations, in function of the particular needs\nand constraints of their application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2007 06:25:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2012 14:50:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-28"}

Fluctuations of the background are\nmeasured using the auto-correlation function of the XRB determined in 5 energy\nbands between 0.3 and 4.5 keV.

For sufficiently small aspect ratios, a gap appears in\nthe first Brillouin zone of the chain lattice in which propagating modes do not\nexist. depending on the SPP polarization, the gap extends to certain intervals\nof the Bloch wave number q. Thus, for transverse polarization, no propagating\nSPPs exist with wave numbers q such that q_c^\\perp < | q | < \\pi/h, h being the\nchain period. For longitudinally polarized SPPs, the gap spans the interval\n|q|<q_c^\\parallel.

The dependence of the dispersion curves on the\nspheroid aspect ratio leads to a number of interesting effects.
