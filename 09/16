We\ncategorize these dynamics into two types: one is the disturbance due to the\nenvironment (e.g. wireless channel conditions, source traffic characteristics,\netc.) and the other is the impact caused by competing users. To analyze the\ninteractions among users given the environment disturbance, we propose a\ngeneral stochastic framework for modeling how the competition among users for\nspectrum opportunities evolves over time. At each stage of the dynamic resource\nallocation, a central spectrum moderator auctions the available resources and\nthe users strategically bid for the required resources.

Various other experimental\nresults seem to point in the same direction: For instance, localized wavelet-\ntype solutions to Maxwell equations have been found, both theoretically and\nexperimentally, that travel with superluminal speed. [Even muonic and\nelectronic neutrinos [it has been proposed] might be \"tachyons\", since their\nsquare mass appears to be negative]. With regard to the first-mentioned\nexperiments, it was recently claimed by Guenter Nimtz that those results with\nevanescent waves (or tunneling photons) imply superluminal signal and impulse\ntransmission, and therefore violate Einstein causality. In this note we want to\nstress that, on the contrary, all such results do not place relativistic\ncausality in jeopardy, even if they referred to actual tachyonic motions: In\nfact, Special Relativity can cope even with superluminal objects and waves. For\ninstance, it is possible (at least in microphysics) to solve also the known\ncausal paradoxes, devised for faster than light motion, although this is not\nwidely recognized yet. Here we show, in detail and rigorously, how to solve the\noldest causal paradox, originally proposed by Tolman, which is the kernel of\nmany further tachyon paradoxes (like J.Bell's, F.A.E.Pirani's, J.D.Edmonds' and\nothers'). The key to the solution is a careful application of tachyon\nmechanics, as it unambiguously follows from special relativity. At Last, in one\nof the two Appendices, we propose how to evaluate the group-velocity in the\ncase of evanescent waves.
