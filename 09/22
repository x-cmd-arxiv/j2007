Direct, co--planar merging orbits produce the largest tidal\ndisturbance and yield that most intense burst of star formation. Contrary to\nnaive expectations, a more compact distribution of gas or an increased gas\nfraction both decrease the burst efficiency.

In these models the motion of molecular\nmotors is viewed as a random walk along the lattices with periodically\ndistributed weak links (bridges). When the particle crosses the weak link it\ncan be destroyed with a probability $p$, driving the molecular motor motion in\none direction. Dynamic properties and effective generated forces of dimer\nmolecular motors are calculated exactly as a function of a concentration of\nbridges $c$ and burning probability $p$ and compared with properties of the\nmonomer motors.

We perform\nsimulations using the same initial conditions, but including molecular cooling,\nusing a complex network that follows molecular hydrogen formation and also\ndirectly follows carbon monoxide and water. We find that molecular hydrogen\ncooling allows roughly equivalent fragmentation to proceed even at zero\nmetallicity for these initial conditions. The apparent transition just\nrepresents the point where metal line cooling becomes more important than\nmolecular cooling. In all cases, the fragments are massive enough to be\nconsistent with models of primordial stellar masses, suggesting that the\ntransition to the modern initial mass function may be determined by other\nphysics such as dust formation. We conclude that such additional cooling\nmechanisms, combined with the exact initial conditions produced by cosmological\ncollapse are likely more important than metal line cooling in determining the\ninitial mass function, and thus that there is unlikely to be a sharp transition\nin the initial mass function at Z/Z_sun = 10^{-3.5}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2007 20:49:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Jan 2009 11:49:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-12"}

We consider that the observed distinctive kinematics of GCs\nwith EHB has valuable information on the formation epochs of GCs and\naccordingly discuss this observational result based on cosmological N-body\nsimulations with a model of GC formation. We assume that GCs in galaxies were\ninitially formed in low-mass halos at high redshifts and we investigate final\nkinematics of GCs in their host halos at $z=0$. We find that GCs formed in\nhalos virialized at z>10 show lower velocity dispersions on average than those\nformed at z>6 for halos with GCs at z=0. We thus suggest that the origin of the\nobserved lower velocity dispersion for the Galactic GCs with EHBs is closely\nassociated with earlier formation epochs (z>10) of halos initially hosting the\nGCs in the course of the Galaxy formation. Considering that the origin of EHBs\ncan be due to the presence of helium-enhanced second-generation stars in GCs,\nwe discuss the longstanding second parameter problem of GCs in the context of\ndifferent degrees of chemical pollution in GC-forming gas clouds within\nlow-mass halos virialized at different redshifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Sep 2007 06:12:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Relying on Chebyshev expansions the Chebyshev space\nrepresentation of a bath has very favorable properties with respect to\nextremely precise and efficient calculations of groundstate properties, static\nand dynamical correlations, and time-evolution for a great variety of quantum\nsystems. The aim of the present work is to introduce the Chebyshev space in\ndetail and to demonstrate the capabilities of the Chebyshev space method.\nAlthough the central idea is derived in full generality the focus is on model\nsystems coupled to fermionic baths.

It is well known that DA: a) reduces the number\nof free parameters, b) guarantees scale invariance through dimensional\nhomogeneity and c) extracts functional information encoded in the dimensionless\ngrouping of variables. Less known are the results of Rudolph and co-workers\nthat DA also gives rise to a new pair of transforms - the similarity transform\n(S) that converts physical dimensional data into dimensionless space and its\ninverse (S'). Here, we present a new matrix generalisation of the Buckingham\nTheorem, made possible by recent developments in the theory of inverse\nnon-square matrices, and show how the transform pair arises naturally. We\ndemonstrate that the inverse transform S' is non-unique and how this casts\ndoubt on scaling relations obtained in cases where observational data has not\nbeen referred to in order to break the degeneracy inherent in transforming back\nto dimensional (physical) space. As an example, we show how the underlying\nfunctional form of the Planck Radiation Law can be deduced in only a few lines\nusing the matrix method and without appealing to first principles; thus\ndemonstrating the possibility of a priori knowledge discovery; but that\nsubsequent data analysis is still required in order to identify the exact\ncausal law. It is hoped that the proof presented here will give theoreticians\nconfidence to pursue inverse problems in physics using DA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Sep 2007 15:47:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2007 17:31:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2007 14:18:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

The initial configuration is chosen\nto have a large energy excess, relative to the thermal equilibrium value at the\nrunning temperature. We show that the initial energy surplus is dissipated in a\nseries of intermittent bursts, or quakes, whose rate decreases as the inverse\nof the age of the system. In addition, one observes energy fluctuations with a\nzero centered Gaussian distribution. These pertain to the pseudo equilibrium\ndynamics within a single metastable state, and do not contribute to the energy\ndissipation. The derivative of the thermal energy with respect to the logarithm\nof time is asymptotically constant, and comprises a temperature independent\npart, and a part with an Arrhenius temperature dependence. The findings closely\nmirror recent numerical simulation results obtained for microscopic glassy\nmodels. For these models, record-sized energy fluctuations have been claimed to\ntrigger intermittent events during low temperature thermalization. In the\npresent model record-sized fluctuations are by construction needed to trigger\nchanges from one metastable state to another. This property thus suffices to\nexplain the statistical property of intermittent energy flow in complex\nmetastable systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Sep 2007 15:52:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2008 12:55:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Apr 2008 13:47:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Vector based data analysis methods have\ntherefore to be adapted in order to be used with non standard complex data. A\nflexible and general solution for this adaptation is to use a (dis)similarity\nmeasure. Indeed, thanks to expert knowledge on the studied data, it is\ngenerally possible to define a measure that can be used to make pairwise\ncomparison between observations. General data analysis methods are then\nobtained by adapting existing methods to (dis)similarity matrices. In this\narticle, we propose an adaptation of Kohonen's Self Organizing Map (SOM) to\n(dis)similarity data. The proposed algorithm is an adapted version of the\nvector based batch SOM.
