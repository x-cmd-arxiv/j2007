We show how a broad class of gravity\ntheories can be tested by combining these probes.

We also discuss quasilinear effects that carry\nsignatures of gravity, such as through induced three-point correlations.\n  Clustering of dark energy can mimic features of modified gravity theories and\nthus confuse the search for distinct signatures of such theories. It can\nproduce pressure perturbations and anisotropic stresses, which breaks the\nequality between the two metric potentials even in general relativity. With\nthese two extra degrees of freedom, can a clustered dark energy model mimic\nmodified gravity models in all observational tests?

In this paper we analyze these claims and\nidentify a number of physical and geometrical effects which invalidate these\nscenarios. We point out two key problems. First, the interacting particles must\nbe causally connected to interact, and this condition is satisfied by only a\nsmall fraction of the emitted particles close to the black hole. Second, a\nscattered particle requires a distance ~ E/m_e^2 for completing each\nbremsstrahlung interaction, with the consequence that it is improbable for\nthere to be more than one complete bremsstrahlung interaction per particle near\nthe black hole. These two effects have not been included in previous analyses.\nWe conclude that the emitted particles do not interact sufficiently to form a\nQED photosphere. Similar arguments apply in the QCD case and prevent a QCD\nphotosphere (chromosphere) from developing when the black hole temperature is\nmuch greater than Lambda_QCD, the threshold for QCD particle emission.\nAdditional QCD phenomenological arguments rule out the development of a\nchromosphere around black hole temperatures of order Lambda_QCD. In all cases,\nthe observational signatures of a cosmic or Galactic halo background of\nprimordial black holes or an individual black hole remain essentially those of\nthe standard Hawking model, with little change to the detection probability. We\nalso consider the possibility, as proposed by Belyanin et al. and D. Cline et\nal., that plasma interactions between the emitted particles form a photosphere,\nand we conclude that this scenario too is not supported.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2007 19:01:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2008 20:34:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 17 Mar 2008 19:06:11 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 23 Mar 2008 17:40:28 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 29 Jul 2008 22:59:10 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 25 Sep 2008 17:18:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

A O(n^3)-algorithm has been introduced for\nfinding such a causal flow when the numbers of output and input vertices in the\ngraph are equal, otherwise no polynomial time algorithm was known for deciding\nwhether a graph has a causal flow or not. Our main contribution is to introduce\na O(n^2)-algorithm for finding a causal flow, if any, whatever the numbers of\ninput and output vertices are. This answers the open question stated by Danos\nand Kashefi and by de Beaudrap. Moreover, we prove that our algorithm produces\nan optimal flow (flow of minimal depth.)\n  Whereas the existence of a causal flow is a sufficient condition for\ndeterminism, it is not a necessary condition. A weaker version of the causal\nflow, called gflow (generalized flow) has been introduced and has been proved\nto be a necessary and sufficient condition for a family of deterministic\ncomputations. Moreover the depth of the quantum computation is upper bounded by\nthe depth of the gflow. However, the existence of a polynomial time algorithm\nthat finds a gflow has been stated as an open question. In this paper we answer\nthis positively with a polynomial time algorithm that outputs an optimal gflow\nof a given graph and thus finds an optimal correction strategy to the\nnondeterministic evolution due to measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2007 17:05:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-23"}

Such survivors, which would by now have become independent relaxed\ngalaxies, would be ideal laboratories, if nearby enough, to tackle a number of\ntopical issues, including the distribution of Dark Matter in and around\ngalaxies. However finding old dwarf galaxies with a confirmed tidal origin is\nan observational challenge. A dwarf galaxy in the Virgo Cluster, VCC 2062,\nexhibits several unusual properties that are typical of a galaxy made out of\nrecycled material. We discuss whether it may indeed be a TDG. We analysed\nmulti-wavelength observations of VCC 2062, including an IRAM CO map, an optical\nspectrum of its HII regions, GALEX ultraviolet and archival broad-band and\nnarrow-band optical images as well as a VLA HI datacube, originally obtained as\npart of the VIVA project. VCC 2062 appears to be the optical, low surface\nbrightness counterpart of a kinematically detached, rotating condensation that\nformed within an HI tail apparently physically linked to the disturbed galaxy\nNGC 4694. In contrast to its faint optical luminosity, VCC 2062 is\ncharacterised by strong CO emission and a high oxygen abundance more typical of\nspiral disks. Its dynamical mass however, is that of a dwarf galaxy. VCC 2062\nwas most likely formed within a pre-enriched gaseous structure expelled from a\nlarger galaxy as a result of a tidal interaction. The natural provider for the\ngaseous tail is NGC 4694 or rather a former companion which subsequently has\nbeen accreted by the massive galaxy. According to that scenario, VCC 2062 has\nbeen formed by a past tidal encounter. Since its parent galaxies have most\nprobably already totally merged, it qualifies as an old TDG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2007 23:19:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

These data are used to investigate the blue-red-near-infrared\ncolours and the colour gradients of the host galaxies of BL Lacs in comparison\nwith other elliptical galaxies with and without nuclear activity. In all cases\ngalaxies are well represented by an elliptical model, with average absolute\nmagnitude M_B=-21.6+-0.7 and average scale length R_e=7.6+-3.2 kpc. The\nbest-fit B-band Kormendy relation is in reasonable agreement with that obtained\nfor normal ellipticals and radio galaxies. This structural and dynamical\nsimilarity indicates that all massive elliptical galaxies can experience\nnuclear activity without significant perturbation of their global structure.\nThe distributions of the integrated blue/near-infrared colour (with average\nB-H=3.5+-0.5) and colour gradient (with average Delta(B-R)/Delta(log\nr)=-0.14+-0.75) of the BL Lac hosts are much wider than those for normal\nellipticals, and most BL Lac objects have bluer hosts and/or steeper colour\ngradients than those in normal ellipticals. The blue colours are likely caused\nby a young stellar population component, and indicates a link between star\nformation caused by an interaction/merging event and the onset of the nuclear\nactivity. This result is corroborated by stellar population modelling,\nindicating a presence of young/intermediate age populations in the majority of\nthe sample, in agreement with low redshift quasar hosts. The lack of strong\nsigns of interaction may require a significant time delay between the event\nwith associated star formation episodes and the start of the nuclear activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2007 09:37:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The TRG is a local coarse-graining transformation, with\nthe elements of the tensor at each lattice site playing the part of the\ninteractions that undergo the renormalization-group flows. These tensor flows\nare directly related to the phase diagram structure of the infinite system,\nwith each phase flowing to a distinct surface of fixed points. Fixed-point\nanalysis and summation along the flows give the critical exponents, as well as\nthermodynamic functions along the entire temperature range. Thus, for the\nferromagnetic triangular lattice Ising model, the free energy is calculated to\nbetter than 10^-5 along the entire temperature range. Unlike previous\nposition-space renormalization-group methods, the truncation (of the tensor\nindex range D) in this general method converges under straightforward and\nsystematic improvements. Our best results are easily obtained with D = 24,\ncorresponding to 4624-dimensional renormalization-group flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2007 12:00:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-18"}

None of the host galaxies are well fit by a simple elliptical\nprofile. The fraction of quasars showing interaction is significantly higher\nthan the 30% seen in samples of host galaxies of normal, unobscured quasars.\nThere is a weak correlation between the amount of dust reddening and the\nmagnitude of interaction in the host galaxy, measured using the Gini\ncoefficient and the Concentration index.

We focus attention on the fact that in such systems confluence of all\nthe factors necessary for gene expression is a comparatively rare event, and\nonly massive redundancy makes such events sufficiently frequent. An immediate\nconsequence of this rareness is burstiness in mRNA and protein copy numbers, a\nwell known experimentally observed effect. We introduce the concept of\nstochastic cooperativity and show that this phenomenon is a natural consequence\nof high dimensionality coupled with highly nonlinearity of a dynamical system.\nIn mathematical terms, burstiness is associated with heavy-tailed probability\ndistributions of stochastic processes describing the dynamics of the system.\nThe sequence of stochastic cooperativity events allows for transition from\ncontinuous deterministic dynamics expressed in terms of ordinary differential\nequations (ODE) to discrete stochastic dynamics expressed in terms of Langevin\nand Fokker-Plank equations. We demonstrate also that high-dimensional nonlinear\nsystems, even in the absence of explicit mechanisms for suppressing inherent\ninstability, may nevertheless reside in a state of stationary pseudo-random\nfluctuations which for all practical purposes may be regarded as stochastic\nprocess.

Because of a\ndecrease by a factor of 30 of the effective bending rigidity of a sequence of\nbroken bonds, or bubble, compared to the double stranded state, the inclusion\nof the molecular conformational degrees of freedom in a more general mesoscopic\nmodel is needed. In this paper we do so by presenting a 1D Ising model, which\ndescribes the internal base pair states, coupled to a discrete worm like chain\nmodel describing the chain configurations [J. Palmeri, M. Manghi, and N.\nDestainville, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 088103 (2007)]. This coupled model is\nexactly solved using a transfer matrix technique that presents an analogy with\nthe path integral treatment of a quantum two-state diatomic molecule. When the\nchain fluctuations are integrated out, the denaturation transition temperature\nand width emerge naturally as an explicit function of the model parameters of a\nwell defined Hamiltonian, revealing that the transition is driven by the\ndifference in bending (entropy dominated) free energy between bubble and\ndouble-stranded segments.

Although\nvery promising from a conceptual point of view, the optimization of the sum of\nper-link rates hinges, in principle, on tough issues such as computational\ncomplexity and the requirement for heavy receiver-to-transmitter channel\ninformation feedback across all network cells. In this paper, we show that, in\nfact, distributed algorithms are actually obtainable in the asymptotic regime\nwhere the numbers of users per cell is allowed to grow large.
