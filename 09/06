In the original classification, it is usual to find planetary nebulae\nthat cannot be associated with a single type; these most likely have dubious\nclassifications into two or three types. Statistical methods can greatly\ncontribute in providing a better characterization of planetary nebulae groups.\nWe use the Bayes Theorem to calculate the posterior probabilities for an object\nto be member of each of the types I, IIa, IIb, III and IV.

The posterior probabilities are defined from the\nprobability density function of classificatory parameters of a well-defined\nsample, composed only by planetary nebulae unambiguously fitted into the\nPeimbert types. Because the probabilities depend on the available observational\ndata, they are conditional probabilities, and, as new observational data are\nadded to the sample, the classification of the nebula can be improved, to take\ninto account this new information. This method differs from the original\nclassificatory scheme, because it provides a quantitative result of the\nrepresentativity of the object within its group.

Aims: We\ntest whether downsizing is caused by activity shifting towards low-mass black\nholes accreting at near-Eddington rates, or by a change in the average rate of\naccretion onto supermassive black holes. We estimate the black hole masses and\nEddington ratios of an X-ray selected sample of AGN in the Chandra Deep Field\nSouth at z<1, probing the epoch where AGN cosmic downsizing has been reported.\nMethods: Black hole masses are estimated both from host galaxy stellar masses,\nwhich are estimated from fitting to published optical and near-infrared\nphotometry, and from near-infrared luminosities, applying established\ncorrelations between black hole mass and host galaxy properties. Both methods\ngive consistent results. Comparison and calibration of possible\nredshift-dependent effects is also made using published faint host galaxy\nvelocity dispersion measurements. Results: The Eddington ratios in our sample\nspan the range 10^{-5} to 1, with median log(L_bol/L_Edd)=-2.87, and with\ntypical black hole masses about 10^{8} solar masses. The broad distribution of\nEddington ratios is consistent with that expected for AGN samples at low and\nmoderate luminosity. We find no evidence that the CDF-S AGN population is\ndominated by low-mass black holes accreting at near-Eddington ratios and the\nresults suggest that diminishing accretion rates onto average-sized black holes\nare responsible for the reported AGN downsizing at redshifts below unity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Sep 2007 08:03:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Our\ncriterion is based on a comparison of the orbits found in N-body realizations\nof analytical potential-density models of triaxial galaxies, in which the\npotential is fitted by the SCF method using a variety of basis sets, with those\nof the original models. Our tests refer to maximally triaxial Dehnen\ngamma-models for values of $\\gamma$ in the range 0<=gamma<=1. When an N-body\nrealization of a model is fitted by the SCF method, the choice of radial basis\nfunctions affects significantly the way the potential, forces, or derivatives\nof the forces are reproduced, especially in the central regions of the system.\nWe find that this results in serious discrepancies in the relative amounts of\nchaotic versus regular orbits, or in the distributions of the Lyapunov\ncharacteristic exponents, as found by different basis sets.

Parametrising the\nrecent star formation (RSF) in terms of the mass fraction of stars less than a\nGyr old, we find that the early-type population as a whole shows a typical RSF\nbetween 5 and 13% in the redshift range 0.5<z<1. Early-types on the UV red\nsequence show RSF values less than 5% while the reddest early-types are\nvirtually quiescent with RSF values of ~1%. We find compelling evidence that\nearly-types of all luminosities form stars over the lifetime of the Universe,\nalthough the bulk of their star formation is already complete at high redshift.\nThis tail-end of star formation is measurable and not negligible, with luminous\n(-23<M(V)<-20.5) early-types potentially forming 10-15% of their mass since\nz=1, with their less luminous (M(V)>-20.5) counterparts potentially forming\n30-60 percent of their mass in the same redshift range.

This quantity is defined as\nthe maximum value of the purity one can get at the output of a channel by\nvarying over all physical input states, when purity is measured by the Schatten\n$q$-norm, and is denoted by $\\nu_q$. The multiplicativity problem is the\nquestion whether two channels used in parallel have a combined $\\nu_q$ that is\nthe product of the $\\nu_q$ of the two channels. A positive answer would imply a\nnumber of other additivity results in QIT.\n  Very recently, P. Hayden has found counterexamples for every value of $q>1$.\nNevertheless, these counterexamples require that the dimension of these\nchannels increases with $1-q$ and therefore do not rule out multiplicativity\nfor $q$ in intervals $[1,q_0)$ with $q_0$ depending on the channel dimension. I\nargue that this would be enough to prove additivity of entanglement of\nformation and of the classical capacity of quantum channels.\n  More importantly, no counterexamples have as yet been found in the important\nspecial case where one of the channels is a qubit-channel, i.e. its input\nstates are 2-dimensional. In this paper I focus attention to this qubit case\nand I rephrase the multiplicativity conjecture in the language of block\nmatrices and prove the conjecture in a number of special cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Sep 2007 13:03:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Spectra from the entire second year of the survey\nand part of the third year (59 total SNe candidates with 46 confirmed SNe Ia)\nare published here for the first time. The spectroscopic measurements made on\nthis data set are used determine if these distant SNe comprise a population\nsimilar to those observed locally. Methods: Rest-frame equivalent width and\nejection velocity measurements are made on four spectroscopic features.\nCorresponding measurements are presented for a set of 167 spectra from 24 low-z\nSNe Ia from the literature. Results: We show that there exists a sample at high\nredshift with properties similar to nearby SNe. No significant difference was\nfound between the distributions of measurements at low and high redsift for\nthree of the features. The fourth feature displays a possible difference that\nshould be investigated further. Correlations between Type Ia SNe properties and\nhost galaxy morphology were also found to be similar at low and high z, and\nwithin each host galaxy class we see no evidence for redshift-evolution in SN\nproperties. A new correlation between SNe Ia peak magnitude and the equivalent\nwidth of SiII absorption is presented. We demonstrate that this correlation\nreduces the scatter in SNe Ia luminosity distances in a manner consistent with\nthe lightcurve shape-luminosity corrections that are used for Type Ia SNe\ncosmology.
