By considering the variation of\nlibration width with different orbital parameters, we identify regions of phase\nspace which give rise to different resonant ''depths,'' and propose methods to\nmodel libration profiles.

Furthermore, couplings of these KK states to light\nquarks and leptons are suppressed, whereas those to top and bottom quarks are\nenhanced compared to the SM gauge couplings. Therefore, the production of light\nquark and lepton states is suppressed relative to other beyond the SM\nconstructions, and the fermionic decays of these states are dominated by the\ntop and bottom quarks, which are, though, overwhelmed by KK gluons dominantly\ndecaying into them.

We investigate\nthe \"critical metallicity\", defined as the the value, Z_crit, at which\nprimordial gas cools more efficiently by fine-structure lines of O I (63.18\nmicrons, Si II 34.8 microns, Fe II (25.99 and 35.35 microns), and C II (157.74\nmicrons) than by either H I or H2 line emission. We explore the time-dependent\nthermodynamics and fragmentation of cooling gas at redshifts z = 10-30, seeded\nby trace heavy elements expelled from early supernovae. Because different modes\nof nucleosynthesis (alpha-process, Fe-group) produce abundance ratios far from\nsolar values, these early stellar populations are likely to be influenced by O,\nSi, and Fe cooling. Our models also include radiative coupling of the fine\nstructure lines and H2 to the cosmic microwave background (CMB), which sets a\ntemperature floor (70-80K at z = 25-30) that may increase the Jeans mass. The\nH2 forms from catalytic effects of electrons left over from the recombination\nepoch or produced during virialization. These electrons form the H^- ion (H + e\n-> H- + gamma), which in turn forms H2 through associative detachment (H- + H\n-> H2 + e). In virialized halos at z = 10-30, the gas densities (n = 1-100\ncm^{-3}) are well below the critical densities, n_cr = 10^{5-6} cm^{-3}, at\nwhich (O, Si, Fe) fine-structure lines reach LTE populations and produce their\nmost efficient cooling.

The X-ray binary nature is further confirmed\nby the report of a detection of a faint point source at the position of the XRT\ncounterpart of the burst in archival XMM-Newton data approximately 6 years\nbefore the burst and in more recent XMM-Newton data obtained at the end of\nSeptember 2006 (nearly 4 months after the burst).

It is\nrevealed that the shape of laser-induced damage in the dielectric crystals\ndepends on the elastic symmetry of crystal and the propagation direction of the\nlaser beam. When the beam propagates along the optic axis of crystals, the\nfigures of the laser damage are six-path stars for LiNbO3 and four-path ones\nfor KDP crystals. For the direction parallel to X and Y axes in KDP crystal,\nthe damage has initially cross-like configuration, with further splitting of\nZ-oriented crack into two cracks in the process of damage evolution, leading to\ntransformation of orthogonal-type damage to a hexagonal-type one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Sep 2007 13:06:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-09-04"}

Massless QCD is\nconsidered, by implementing the usual multiplicative scaling of the gluon and\nquark wave functions and vertices. However, also massive quark and gluon\ncounter-terms are allowed in this mass less theory since the condensates are\nexpected to generate masses. A natural set of expansion parameters of the\nphysical quantities is introduced: the coupling itself and to masses $m_q$ and\n$m_g$ associated to quarks and gluons respectively. This procedure allows to\nimplement a dimensional transmutation effect through these new mass scales. A\ngeneral expression for the new generating functional in terms of the mass\nparameters $m_q$ and $m_g$ is obtained in terms of integrals over arbitrary but\nconstant gluon or quark fields in each case. Further, the one loop potential,\nis evaluated in more detail in the case when only the quark condensate is\nretained.
