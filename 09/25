If indeed bound, then the timing argument combined with the known\nage of the Universe implies that M = 5.58^{+0.85}_{-0.72}x10^{12} solar masses.\nThis is on the high end of the allowed mass range suggested by cosmologically\nmotivated models for the individual structure and dynamics of M31 and the Milky\nWay, respectively. It is therefore possible that the timing mass is an\noverestimate of the true mass, especially if one takes into account recent\nresults from the Millennium Simulation that show that there is also a\ntheoretical uncertainty of 41 percent (Gaussian dispersion) in timing mass\nestimates. The M31 transverse velocity implies that M33 is in a tightly bound\norbit around M31. This may have led to some tidal deformation of M33. It will\nbe worthwhile to search for observational evidence of this.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2007 17:40:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2008 23:40:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

This\nalso seems to be the case of Sagittarius A* in the Galactic Center, where the\nbroad-band radiation is produced, likely via the synchrotron self-Compton\nmechanism. It has been proposed that strong-field gravitational lensing\nmagnifies the flares. The effect of lensing is generally weak and requires a\nfine-tuned geometrical arrangement, which occurs with only a low probability.\nHowever, there are several aspects that make Sagittarius A* a promising target\nto reveal strong gravity effects. Unlike type II (obscured) active galaxies,\nchances are that a flare is detected at high inclination, which would be\nfavourable for lensing. Time delays can then significantly influence the\nobserved flare duration and the form of light-curve profiles. Here we discuss\nan idea that the impact of lensing amplification should be considerably\nenhanced when the shape of the flaring clump is appropriately elongated in the\nform of a spiral wave or a narrow filament, rather than a simple (circular)\nspot which we employed previously within the phenomenological `orbiting spot\nmodel'. By parameterizing the emission region in terms of the spiral shape and\ncontrast, we are able to extend the spot model to more complicated sources. In\nthe case of spirals, we notice a possibility that more photons reach a distant\nobserver at the same moment because of interplay between lensing and\nlight-travel time. The effect is not symmetrical with respect to leading versus\ntrailing spirals, so in principle the source geometry can be constrained. In\nspite of this, the spot model seems to provide entirely adequate framework to\nstudy the currently available data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2007 20:18:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2007 18:43:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-17"}

Aims: We explore the stability of stratified,\nrotating, relativistic two-component jets, in turn embedded in static\ninterstellar medium. Methods: In a grid-adaptive relativistic hydrodynamic\nsimulation with the AMRVAC code, the non-linear azimuthal stability of\ntwo-component relativistic jets is investigated. We simulate until multiple\ninner jet rotations have been completed. Results: We find evidence for the\ndevelopment of an extended shear flow layer between the two jet components,\nresulting from the growth of a body mode in the inner jet, Kelvin-Helmholtz\nsurface modes at their original interface, and their nonlinear interaction.\nBoth wave modes are excited by acoustic waves which are reflected between the\nsymmetry axis and the interface of the two jet components. Their interaction\ninduces the growth of near stationary, counterrotating vortices at the outer\nedge of the shear flow layer. The presence of a heavy external jet allows to\nslow down their further development, and maintain a collimated flow. At the\nouter jet boundary, small-scale Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities develop, without\ndisrupting the jet configuration.

To characterize this multi-user interaction, the\nStackelberg equilibrium is introduced, and the existence of this equilibrium\nfor the investigated non-cooperative game is shown.

Thus, these neutrinos can\nbe a striking dark matter signature at neutrino telescopes looking towards the\nSun and/or the Earth. Here, we improve previous analyses on computing the\nneutrino yields from WIMP annihilations in several respects. We include\nneutrino oscillations in a full three-flavor framework as well as all effects\nfrom neutrino interactions on the way through the Sun (absorption, energy loss,\nand regeneration from tau decays). In addition, we study the effects of\nnon-zero values of the mixing angle $\\theta_{13}$ as well as the normal and\ninverted neutrino mass hierarchies. Our study is performed in an event-based\nsetting which makes these results very useful both for theoretical analyses and\nfor building a neutrino telescope Monte Carlo code. All our results for the\nneutrino yields, as well as our Monte Carlo code, are publicly available. We\nfind that the yield of muon-type neutrinos from WIMP annihilations in the Sun\nis enhanced or suppressed, depending on the dominant WIMP annihilation channel.\nThis effect is due to an effective flavor mixing caused by neutrino\noscillations. For WIMP annihilations inside the Earth, the distance from source\nto detector is too small to allow for any significant amount of oscillations at\nthe neutrino energies relevant for neutrino telescopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2007 09:13:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 2008 14:24:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-06"}

The resulting couplings in such\nmodels are an artifact of the compactification of the extra dimensions present\ninevitably in a string scenario. The moduli parameters which encode the compact\nmanifold therefore play a crucial role in determining the axion-photon\ncoupling. In this work we examine the possible bounds on the value of compact\nmodulus that emerge from the experimental limits on the coupling obtained from\nthe PVLAS data. In particular we focus into the Randall-Sundrum (RS) type of\nwarped geometry model whose modulus parameter is already restricted from the\nrequirement of the resolution of gauge hierarchy problem in connection with the\nmass of the Higgs. We explore the bound on the modulus for a wide range of the\naxion mass for both the birefringence and the dichroism data in PVLAS. We show\nthat the proposed value of the modulus in the RS scenario can only be\naccommodated for axion mass $\\gsim$ 0.3 eV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2007 13:03:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2008 13:00:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-17"}

The capacitor consists of a cavity which is via a quantum\npoint contact connected to an electron reservoir and Coulomb coupled to a gate.\nThe capacitor is in a perpendicular high magnetic field such that only one\n(spin polarized) edge state is (partially) transmitted through the contact. In\nthe coherent limit the charge relaxation resistance for a single channel\ncontact is independent of the transmission probability of the contact and given\nby half a resistance quantum. The loss of coherence in the conductor is modeled\nby attaching to it a fictitious probe, which draws no net current. In the\nincoherent limit one could expect a charge relaxation resistance that is\ninversely proportional to the transmission probability of the quantum point\ncontact. However, such a two terminal result requires that scattering is\nbetween two electron reservoirs which provide full inelastic relaxation. We\nfind that dephasing of a single edge state in the cavity is not sufficient to\ngenerate an interface resistance. As a consequence the charge relaxation\nresistance is given by the sum of one constant interface resistance and the\n(original) Landauer resistance. The same result is obtained in the high\ntemperature regime due to energy averaging over many occupied states in the\ncavity. Only for a large number of open dephasing channels, describing\nspatially homogenous dephasing in the cavity, do we recover the two terminal\nresistance, which is inversely proportional to the transmission probability of\nthe QPC.
