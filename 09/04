The calculated results are compared with a simple scaling of the\nHeitler-London hydrogenic exchange; the scaled hydrogenic results give the\ncorrect order of magnitude but fail to reproduce quantitatively our\ncalculations. We calculate the donor exchange in silicon including inter-valley\ninterference terms for donor pairs along the $\\{100\\}$ direction, and also show\nthe influence of the donor type on the distribution of nearest-neighbour\nexchange constants at different concentrations. Our methods can be used to\ncompute the exchange interactions between two donor electrons with arbitrary\nbinding energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Sep 2007 16:34:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Their existence was discovered in\nthe early 1980's, independently by Herman for quasiperiodic SL(2,R)-cocycles\nand by Grebogi et al for so-called 'pinched skew products'. However, except for\nthese two particular classes there are still hardly any rigorous results on the\ntopic, despite a large number of numerical studies which all confirmed the\nwidespread existence of SNA in quasiperiodically forced systems.\n  Here, we prove the existence of SNA in quasiperiodically forced circle maps\nunder rather general conditions, which can be stated in terms of C 1\n-estimates. As a consequence, we obtain the existence of strange non-chaotic\nattractors for parameter sets of positive measure in suitable parameter\nfamilies. Further, we show that the considered systems have minimal dynamics.\nThe results apply in particular to a forced version of the Arnold circle map.\nFor this particular example, we also describe how the first Arnold tongue\ncollapses and looses its regularity due to the presence of strange non-chaotic\nattractors and a related unbounded mean motion property.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Sep 2007 16:44:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-09-04"}

In this paper, we definitively identify the dust trail and\nthe neckline structure using a wide-field CCD camera attached to the Kiso\n1.05-m Schmidt telescope. The dust trail of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko was\nevident as scattered sunlight in all images taken between September 9, 2002 and\nFebruary 1, 2003, whereas the neckline structure became obvious only after late\n2002.\n  We compared our images with a semi-analytical dynamic model of dust grains\nemitted from the nucleus. A fading of the surface brightness of the dust trail\nnear the nucleus enabled us to determine the typical maximum size of the\ngrains. Assuming spherical compact particles with a mass density of 103 kg m-3\nand an albedo of 0.04, we deduced that the maximum diameter of the dust\nparticles was approximately 1 cm.

The\ninstantaneous propagation of Newtonian gravity is obtained with an\nincompressible ether, giving a field equation for p_e. For a compressible\nether, this equation holds in the static case. The extension to non-static\nsituations follows the lines of acoustics and leads to gravitational (pressure)\nwaves. To account for metric effects, the modern version of the\nLorentz-Poincare interpretation of special relativity is used. Einstein's\nequivalence principle (EP) is seen as a correspondence between the metric\neffects of gravity and those of uniform motion with respect to the ether: a\ngravitational contraction (dilation) of space (time) standards is assumed. This\nimplies geodesic motion for test particles in a static field. The scalar field\nequation is now expressed in terms of the physical space and time metrics in\nthe frame of ether. Since both metrics depend on p_e due to the EP, it becomes\nnon-linear in p_e. In the spherical static situation, Schwarzschild's exterior\nmetric is predicted, but the interior metric differs from GR. Since pressure\nproduces gravitation also in the investigated theory, no equilibrium is\npossible for very massive objects. But the gravitational collapse in free fall\ndoes not lead to any singularity.

Numerical ocean models are essential for creating\nstorm surge forecasts for coastal areas. These models are driven primarily by\nthe surface wind forcings. Currently, the gridded wind fields used by ocean\nmodels are specified by deterministic formulas that are based on the central\npressure and location of the storm center. While these equations incorporate\nimportant physical knowledge about the structure of hurricane surface wind\nfields, they cannot always capture the asymmetric and dynamic nature of a\nhurricane. A new Bayesian multivariate spatial statistical modeling framework\nis introduced combining data with physical knowledge about the wind fields to\nimprove the estimation of the wind vectors. Many spatial models assume the data\nfollow a Gaussian distribution. However, this may be overly-restrictive for\nwind fields data which often display erratic behavior, such as sudden changes\nin time or space. In this paper we develop a semiparametric multivariate\nspatial model for these data. Our model builds on the stick-breaking prior,\nwhich is frequently used in Bayesian modeling to capture uncertainty in the\nparametric form of an outcome. The stick-breaking prior is extended to the\nspatial setting by assigning each location a different, unknown distribution,\nand smoothing the distributions in space with a series of kernel functions.\nThis semiparametric spatial model is shown to improve prediction compared to\nusual Bayesian Kriging methods for the wind field of Hurricane Ivan.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2007 13:27:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

Our conclusion is that under reasonable smoothness, one\ndoes not need to consider too closely how the microstructure is formed, while\nif severe non-smoothness is suspected, one needs to pay attention to the\nprecise structure and also the use to which the estimator of volatility will be\nput.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2007 14:27:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-02"}

We show that, in disk formation, the requirement is far less\nstringent. This conclusion is drawn from a set of 2D (axisymmetric) simulations\nof the collapse of rotating, magnetized, singular isothermal cores. We find\nthat a weak field corresponding to 1ambda~100 can begin to disrupt the\nrotationally supported disk through magnetic braking, by creating regions of\nrapid, supersonic collapse in the disk. These regions are separated by one or\nmore centrifugal barriers, where the rapid infall is temporarily halted. The\nnumber of centrifugal barriers increases with lambda. When lambda>~100, they\nmerge together to form a more or less contiguous, rotationally supported disk.\nEven though the magnetic field in such a case is extremely weak on the scale of\ndense cores, it is amplified by collapse and differential rotation, to the\nextent that its pressure dominates the thermal pressure in both the disk and\nits surrounding region. For relatively strongly magnetized cores with\nlambda<~10, the disk formation is suppressed completely, as found previously. A\nnew feature is that the mass accretion is highly episodic, due to reconnection\nof the accumulated magnetic field lines. For rotationally supported disks to\nappear during the protostellar mass accretion phase of star formation in dense\ncores with realistic field strengths, the powerful magnetic brake must be\nweakened, perhaps through nonideal MHD effects and/or protostellar winds. We\ndiscuss the possibility of observing a generic product of the magnetic braking,\nan extended circumstellar region that is supported by a combination of toroidal\nmagnetic field and rotation - a \"magnetogyrosphere\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2007 15:51:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
