We measure accelerations using a\nformal analysis method that involves simultaneous decomposition of maser\nspectra for all epochs into multiple, Gaussian components. Components are\ncoupled between epochs by linear drifts (accelerations) from their centroid\nvelocities at a reference epoch. For high-velocity emission, accelerations lie\nin the range -0.7 to +0.7 km/s/yr indicating an origin within 13 degrees of the\ndisk midline (the perpendicular to the line-of-sight to the black hole).\nComparison of high-velocity emission projected positions in VLBI images, with\nthose derived from acceleration data, provides evidence that masers trace real\ngas dynamics. High-velocity emission accelerations do not support a model of\ntrailing shocks associated with spiral arms in the disk.

Even when supersymmetry is\nbroken softly, there often remain directions in the scalar field space along\nwhich the potential is almost flat. Upon breaking a gauge symmetry along one of\nthese almost flat directions, cosmic strings may form. Relative to the standard\ncosmic string picture based on the abelian Higgs model, these flat-direction\ncosmic strings have the extreme Type-I properties of a thin gauge core\nsurrounded by a much wider scalar field profile. We perform a comprehensive\nstudy of the microscopic, macroscopic, and observational characteristics of\nthis class of strings.

But the most distinct imprint of AGN feedback is a\nsubstantial increase in the thermal SZ distortions around elliptical galaxies,\npost-starburst ellipticals, and quasars, which is linearly proportional to the\noutflow energy. While point source subtraction is difficult for quasars, we\nshow that by appropriately stacking microwave measurements around early-type\ngalaxies, the new generation of small-scale microwave telescopes will be able\nto directly measure AGN feedback at the level important for current theoretical\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Sep 2007 20:46:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Many previous\nalgorithms for distributed topology control have assumed an ability at each\nnode to deduce some location-based information such as the direction and the\ndistance of its neighbor nodes with respect to itself. Such a deduction of\nlocation-based information, however, cannot be relied upon in real environments\nwhere the path loss exponents vary greatly leading to significant errors in\ndistance estimates. Also, multipath effects may result in different signal\npaths with different loss characteristics, and none of these paths may be\nline-of-sight, making it difficult to estimate the direction of a neighboring\nnode. In this paper, we present Step Topology Control (STC), a simple\ndistributed topology control algorithm which reduces energy consumption while\npreserving the connectivity of a heterogeneous sensor network without use of\nany location-based information.

To\nlowest order, the shear is proportional to the mean image ellipticity. If the\nimage sizes are not small compared to the scale over which the shear varies,\nhigher-order distortions occur, called flexion. For ordinary weak lensing, the\nobservable quantity is not the shear, but the reduced shear, owing to the\nmass-sheet degeneracy. Likewise, the flexion itself is unobservable. Rather,\nhigher-order image distortions measure the reduced flexion, i.e., derivatives\nof the reduced shear. We derive the corresponding lens equation in terms of the\nreduced flexion and calculate the resulting relation between brightness moments\nof source and image. Assuming an isotropic distribution of source orientations,\nestimates for the reduced shear and flexion are obtained; these are then tested\nwith simulations. In particular, the presence of flexion affects the\ndetermination of the reduced shear. The results of these simulations yield the\namount of bias of the estimators, as a function of the shear and flexion. We\npoint out and quantify a fundamental limitation of the flexion formalism, in\nterms of the product of reduced flexion and source size. If this product\nincreases above the derived threshold, multiple images of the source are formed\nlocally, and the formalism breaks down. Finally, we show how a general\n(reduced) flexion field can be decomposed into its four components: two of them\nare due to a shear field, carrying an E- and B-mode in general. The other two\ncomponents do not correspond to a shear field; they can also be split up into\ncorresponding E- and B-modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2007 06:58:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Magnetic flux transport and the finite time delay it introduces,\nspecifically in the so-called Babcock-Leighton models of the solar cycle with\nspatially segregated source regions for the alpha and omega effects, play a\ncrucial rule in this predictability. Through dynamo simulations with such a\nmodel, we study the physical basis of solar cycle predictions by examining two\ncontrasting regimes, one dominated by diffusive magnetic flux transport in the\nsolar convection zone, the other dominated by advective flux transport by\nmeridional circulation. Our analysis shows that diffusion plays an important\nrole in flux transport, even when the solar cycle period is governed by the\nmeridional flow speed. We further examine the persistence of memory of past\ncycles in the advection and diffusion dominated regimes through stochastically\nforced dynamo simulations. We find that in the advection-dominated regime, this\nmemory persists for up to three cycles, whereas in the diffusion-dominated\nregime, this memory persists for mainly one cycle. This indicates that solar\ncycle predictions based on these two different regimes would have to rely on\nfundamentally different inputs - which may be the cause of conflicting\npredictions.

In the absence of electrolyte and surfactant,\nparticle interactions exhibit a long-range repulsion, yet the variation of the\ninteraction for different particle pairs is found to be considerable. Averaging\nover several particle pairs was hence found to be necessary to obtain reliable\nassessment of the effects of salt and surfactant.

This implies that\ncharges on the water side also contribute significantly to the electrostatic\ninteractions. An increase in the concentration of SDS leads to a similar\ndecrease of the interaction force. Moreover the repulsion at fixed SDS\nconcentrations decreases over longer times.

During epochs of high X-ray/radio activity near the beginning and end of\nthis period, we find that the $1.87 $\\um infrared flux is generally low ($\\sim\n2$ mJy) and relatively steady. However, during the X-ray/radio ``plateau''\nstate between these epochs, we find that the infrared flux is significantly\nhigher ($\\sim 4-6$ mJy), and strongly variable. In particular, we find events\nwith amplitudes $\\sim 20-30$% occurring on timescales of $\\sim 10-20$s\n(e-folding timescales of $\\sim 30$s). These flickering timescales are several\ntimes faster than any previously-observed infrared variability in GRS 1915+105\nand the IR variations exceed corresponding X-ray variations at the same ($\\sim\n8s$) timescale. These results suggest an entirely new type of infrared\nvariability from this object. Based on the properties of this flickering, we\nconclude that it arises in the plateau-state jet outflow itself, at a distance\n$<2.5$ AU from the accretion disk. We discuss the implications of this work and\nthe potential of further flickering observations for understanding jet\nformation around black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2007 14:47:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We present a new statistical\ntreatment of the available observational data on the star formation rate and\nmetallicity that accounts for the presence of possible systematics.

We distinguish between these modes by\ndefining a characteristic minimum mass, M > 10^{11} M_solar, in our fiducial\nmodel, for early type galaxies where star formation occurs efficiently. Our\nresults indicate that the hierarchical star formation model can achieve better\nagreement with the data, but that this requires a high efficiency of\nsupernova-driven outflows. In a monolithic model, our analysis points to the\nneed for a mechanism that drives metal-poor winds, perhaps in the form of\nsupermassive black hole-induced outflows. Furthermore, the relative absence of\nstar formation beyond z ~ 5 in the monolithic scenario requires an alternative\nmechanism to dwarf galaxies for reionizing the universe at z ~ 11, as required\nby observations of the microwave background.
