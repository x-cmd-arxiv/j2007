The resulting distribution in the\ntwo-jet region T~1 is found to agree with the corresponding expression derived\nby the standard approach. A matching procedure to account for finite\ncorrections at T < 1 is then described. There are two important advantages of\nthe SCET approach. First, SCET manifests a dynamical seesaw scale q = p^2/Q in\naddition to the center-of-mass energy Q and the jet mass scale p ~ Q ~ sqrt(1 -\nT). Thus, the resummation of logs of p/q can be cleanly distinguished from the\nresummation of logs of Q/p. Second, finite parts of loop amplitudes appear in\nspecific places in the perturbative distribution: in the matching to the hard\nfunction, at the scale Q, in matching to the jet function, at the scale p, and\nin matching to the soft function, at the scale q. This allows for a consistent\nmerger of fixed order corrections and resummation. In particular, the total NLO\ne+e- cross section is reproduced from these finite parts without having to\nperform additional infrared regulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2007 18:55:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Dec 2007 15:26:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The\nmembers of this family involve the nonlinear advection of a dynamically active\nscalar field, the locality of the streamfunction-scalar relation is denoted by\n$\\alpha$, with smaller $\\alpha$ implying increased locality. The dispersive\nnature arises via a linear term whose strength is characterized by a parameter\n$\\epsilon$. Setting $0 < \\epsilon \\le 1$, we investigate the interplay of\nadvection and dispersion for differing degrees of locality. Specifically, we\nstudy the forward (inverse) transfer of enstrophy (energy) under large-scale\n(small-scale) random forcing. Straightforward arguments suggest that for small\n$\\alpha$ the scalar field should consist of progressively larger eddies, while\nfor large $\\alpha$ the scalar field is expected to have a filamentary structure\nresulting from a stretch and fold mechanism. Confirming this, we proceed to\nforced/dissipative dispersive numerical experiments under weakly non-local to\nlocal conditions.

After\ndeveloping intuition about the predictions from these models through analytic\napproximations, we compute the predicted cosmological observables through full\nnumerical evolution of the equations of motion, relating the mass scale and\nscale of dissipation to the characteristic amplitude and shape of the\nprimordial power spectrum. We then use Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques to\nconstrain a subset of the models with cosmological data from the cosmic\nmicrowave background (WMAP three-year data) and large scale structure (SDSS\nLuminous Red Galaxy power spectrum). We find that the posterior distributions\nof the dissipative parameters are highly non-Gaussian and their allowed ranges\nagree well with the expectations obtained using analytic approximations. In the\nweak regime, only the mass scale is tightly constrained; conversely, in the\nstrong regime, only the dissipative coefficient is tightly constrained. A lower\nlimit is seen on the inflation scale: a sub-Planckian inflaton is disfavoured\nby the data. In both weak and strong regimes, we reconstruct the limits on the\nprimordial power spectrum and show that these models prefer a {\\it red}\nspectrum, with no significant running of the index. We calculate the reheat\ntemperature and show that the gravitino problem can be overcome with large\ndissipation, which in turn leads to large levels of non-Gaussianity: if\ndissipative inflation is to evade the gravitino problem, the predicted level of\nnon-Gaussianity might be seen by the Planck satellite.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2007 14:20:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2008 11:45:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-12"}

One is\nwhen high dimensional measurements are available, for example, gene expression\ndata produced by microarray techniques. For computational or other reasons,\npeople may select only a small subset of features when modelling such data, by\nlooking at how relevant the features are to predicting the response, based on\nsome measure such as correlation with the response in the training data.\nAlthough it is used very commonly, this procedure will make the response appear\nmore predictable than it actually is. In Chapter 2, we propose a Bayesian\nmethod to avoid this selection bias, with application to naive Bayes models and\nmixture models.\n  High dimensional features also arise when we consider high-order\ninteractions. The number of parameters will increase exponentially with the\norder considered. In Chapter 3, we propose a method for compressing a group of\nparameters into a single one, by exploiting the fact that many predictor\nvariables derived from high-order interactions have the same values for all the\ntraining cases.

We report an orbital period of 3376.3+/-0.3 s, or\n56.272+/-0.005 min, based on an observed `S-wave' in the helium emission lines\nof the spectra. This confirms the ultracompact nature of the binary. Despite\nits relative closeness to the orbital period minimum for hydrogen-rich donors,\nthere is no evidence for hydrogen in the spectra. We thus classify SDSS J1552\nas a new bona fide AM CVn star, with the second-longest orbital period after\nV396 Hya (P=65.5 min). The continuum of SDSS J1552 is compatible with either a\nblackbody or helium atmosphere of 12,000-15,000 K. If this represents the\nphotosphere of the accreting white dwarf, as is expected, it puts the accretor\nat the upper end of the temperature range predicted by thermal evolution\nmodels. This suggests that SDSS J1552 consists of (or formerly consisted of)\nrelatively high-mass components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2007 05:32:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

This is important for\nthe chemical evolution of galaxies, the enrichment of the intergalactic medium,\nand for the understanding of the formation of galaxies in the early universe.\n  Aims: We want to investigate whether the ionized gas detected in two\nirregular dwarf galaxies (NGC 2366 and NGC 4861) stays gravitationally bound to\nthe host galaxy or can escape from it by becoming a freely flowing wind.\n  Methods: Very deep H\\alpha images of NGC 2366 and NGC 4861 were obtained to\ndetect and catalog both small and large scale ionized gas structures down to\nvery low surface brightnesses. Subsequently, high-resolution long-slit echelle\nspectroscopy of the H\\alpha line was performed for a detailed kinematic\nanalysis of the most prominent filaments and shells.

A key example is the\nmeasurement of optical phase, used in length metrology and many other\napplications. Advances in precision measurement have consistently led to\nimportant scientific discoveries. At the fundamental level, measurement\nprecision is limited by the number N of quantum resources (such as photons)\nthat are used. Standard measurement schemes, using each resource independently,\nlead to a phase uncertainty that scales as 1/sqrt(N) - known as the standard\nquantum limit. However, it has long been conjectured that it should be possible\nto achieve a precision limited only by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle,\ndramatically improving the scaling to 1/N. It is commonly thought that\nachieving this improvement requires the use of exotic quantum entangled states,\nsuch as the NOON state. These states are extremely difficult to generate.\nMeasurement schemes with counted photons or ions have been performed with N <=\n6, but few have surpassed the standard quantum limit and none have shown\nHeisenberg-limited scaling. Here we demonstrate experimentally a\nHeisenberg-limited phase estimation procedure. We replace entangled input\nstates with multiple applications of the phase shift on unentangled\nsingle-photon states.

This {measurable} world-velocity\ntherefore represents the speed at which \"all\" kinds of particles move in\nspacetime, according to any observer.

The energy input from an active central\nmassive black hole is invoked to suppress star formation in early-type galaxies\nat later epochs. A major problem is that this process is poorly understood, and\ncompelling observational evidence for its mere existence is still missing. In\nsearch for signatures of AGN feedback, we have compiled a sample of 16,000\nearly-type galaxies in the redshift range 0.05<z<0.1 from the SDSS database.\nKey in our approach is the use of a purely morphological selection criterion\nthrough visual inspection which produces a sample that is not biased against\nrecent star formation and nuclear activity. The objects with emission (~20 per\ncent) are offset from the red sequence and form a well-defined pattern in the\ncolour-mass diagram. Star forming early-types inhabit the blue cloud, while\nearly-types with AGN are located considerably closer to and almost on the red\nsequence. Star formation-AGN composites are found right between these two\nextremes. We further derive galaxy star formation histories using a novel\nmethod that combines multiwavelength photometry from near-UV to near-IR and\nstellar absorption indices. We find that in those objects deviating from the\nred sequence star formation occurred several 100 Myr in the past involving 1-10\nper cent of the total stellar mass. We identify an evolutionary sequence from\nstar formation via nuclear activity to quiescence. This transition process\nlasts about 1 Gyr, and the peak AGN phase occurs roughly half a Gyr after the\nstarburst.
