Which is the obliquity's\ndynamical behavior deriving from a complete spin-orbit motion of Mercury\nsimultaneously integrated with planetary interactions? We have used our SONYR\nmodel integrating the spin-orbit N-body problem applied to the solar System\n(Sun and planets). For lack of current accurate observations or ephemerides of\nMercury's rotation, and therefore for lack of valid initial conditions for a\nnumerical integration, we have built an original method for finding the\nlibration center of the spin-orbit system and, as a consequence, for avoiding\narbitrary amplitudes in librations of the spin-orbit motion as well as in\nMercury's obliquity. The method has been carried out in two cases: (1) the\nspin-orbit motion of Mercury in the 2-body problem case (Sun-Mercury) where an\nuniform precession of the Keplerian orbital plane is kinematically added at a\nfixed inclination (S2K case), (2) the spin-orbit motion of Mercury in the\nN-body problem case (Sun and planets) (Sn case). We find that the remaining\namplitude of the oscillations in the Sn case is one order of magnitude larger\nthan in the S2K case, namely 4 versus 0.4 arcseconds (peak-to-peak). The mean\nobliquity is also larger, namely 1.98 versus 1.80 arcminutes, for a difference\nof 10.8 arcseconds.

H3+ is detected in eight diffuse cloud\nsightlines with column densities varying from 0.6x10^14 cm^-2 to 3.9x10^14\ncm^-2. This brings to fourteen the total number of diffuse cloud sightlines\nwhere H3+ has been detected. These detections are mostly along sightlines\nconcentrated in the Galactic plane, but well dispersed in Galactic longitude.\nThe results imply that abundant H3+ is common in the diffuse interstellar\nmedium. Because of the simple chemistry associated with H3+ production and\ndestruction, these column density measurements can be used in concert with\nvarious other data to infer the primary cosmic-ray ionization rate, zeta_p.\nValues range from 0.5x10^-16 s^-1 to 3x10^-16 s^-1 with an average of 2x10^-16\ns^-1. Where H3+ is not detected the upper limits on the ionization rate are\nconsistent with this range. The average value of zeta_p is about an order of\nmagnitude larger than both the canonical rate and rates previously reported by\nother groups using measurements of OH and HD. The discrepancy is most likely\ndue to inaccurate measurements of rate constants and the omission of effects\nwhich were unknown when those studies were performed. We believe that the\nobserved column density of H3+ is the most direct tracer for the cosmic-ray\nionization rate due to its simple chemistry.

For each star we have a high signal to noise ratio\ntemplate spectrum, which we use to determine spectroscopic stellar parameters.\nAim: The aim of this paper is to present spectroscopic stellar parameters, i.e.\neffective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity and rotational velocity for\nour sample of G and K giant stars. Methods: Effective temperatures, surface\ngravities and metallicities are determined from the equivalent width of iron\nlines. Rotational velocities are determined from the full width at half maximum\n(FWHM) of moderate spectral lines. A calibration between the FWHM and total\nbroadening (rotational velocity and macro turbulence) is obtained from stars in\ncommon between our sample and the sample from Gray (1989). Results: The\nmetallicity we derive is essentially equal to the literature values, while the\neffective temperature and surface gravity are slightly higher by 56 K and 0.15\ndex, respectively. Our rotational velocities are comparable with the ones\nobtained by Gray (1989), but somewhat higher than the ones obtained by de\nMedeiros & Mayor (1999), consistent with the different diagnostics used.\nConclusions: We are able to determine spectroscopic stellar parameters for\nabout 380 G and K giant stars in a uniform way (112 stars are being analysed\nspectroscopically for the first time).

For both mass and light, we de-project the profiles to\nproduce 3D mass and light profiles over scales from 25 kpc/ to 22 Mpc/h. From\nthese profiles we calculate the cumulative excess mass M(r) and excess light\nL(r) as a function of separation from the BCG. On small scales, where \\rho(r)\n>> \\bar{\\rho}, the integrated mass-to-light profile may be interpreted as the\ncluster mass-to-light ratio. We find the M/L_{200}, the mass-to-light ratio\nwithin r_{200}, scales with cluster mass as a power law with index 0.33+/-0.02.\nOn large scales, where \\rho(r) ~ \\bar{\\rho}, the M/L approaches an asymptotic\nvalue independent of cluster richness. For small groups, the mean M/L_{200} is\nmuch smaller than the asymptotic value, while for large clusters it is\nconsistent with the asymptotic value. This asymptotic value should be\nproportional to the mean mass-to-light ratio of the universe <M/L>. We find\n<M/L>/b^2_{ml} = 362+/-54 h (statistical). There is additional uncertainty in\nthe overall calibration at the ~10% level. The parameter b_{ml} is primarily a\nfunction of the bias of the L <~ L_* galaxies used as light tracers, and should\nbe of order unity. Multiplying by the luminosity density in the same bandpass\nwe find \\Omega_m/b^2_{ml} = 0.02+/-0.03, independent of the Hubble parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2007 20:55:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2008 20:54:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-02"}

Analysis of C18O and NH3 molecular-line\nobservations reveals very narrow lines. The non-thermal velocity dispersions\nmeasured in both these tracers are found to be subsonic for the large majority\nof the cores and show no correlation with core mass (or size). Thermal pressure\nis thus the dominate source of internal gas pressure and support for most of\nthe core population. The total internal gas pressures of the cores are found to\nbe roughly independent of core mass over the entire range of the core mass\nfunction (CMF) indicating that the cores are in pressure equilibrium with an\nexternal source of pressure. This external pressure is most likely provided by\nthe weight of the surrounding Pipe cloud within which the cores are embedded.\nMost of the cores appear to be pressure confined, gravitationally unbound\nentities whose nature, structure and future evolution are determined by only a\nfew physical factors which include self-gravity, the fundamental processes of\nthermal physics and the simple requirement of pressure equilibrium with the\nsurrounding environment. The observed core properties likely constitute the\ninitial conditions for star formation in dense gas. The entire core population\nis found to be characterized by a single critical Bonnor-Ebert mass. This mass\ncoincides with the characteristic mass of the Pipe CMF indicating that most\ncores formed in the cloud are near critical stability. This suggests that the\nmass function of cores (and the IMF) has its origin in the physical process of\nthermal fragmentation in a pressurized medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2007 21:12:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The two kinds of presentation share many traits but also display\nprofound differences on issues ranging from decidability to modeling\nconvenience and physical implementability.\n  Following a conjecture by Toffoli and Margolus, it had been proved by Kari\n(and by Durand--Lose for more than two dimensions) that any invertible CA can\nbe rewritten as an LG (with a possibly much more complex ``unit cell''). But\nuntil now it was not known whether this is possible in general for\nnoninvertible CA--which comprise ``almost all'' CA and represent the bulk of\nexamples in theory and applications.

The models assume organisms\nwhose genomes consist of two chromosomes, where each chromosome is assumed to\nbe functional if it is equal to some master sequence $ \\sigma_0 $, and\nnon-functional otherwise. The first-order growth rate constant, or fitness, of\nan organism, is determined by whether it has zero, one, or two functional\nchromosomes in its genome. For a population replicating asexually, a given cell\nreplicates both of its chromosomes, and splits its genetic material evenly\nbetween the two cells. For a population replicating sexually, a given cell\nfirst divides into two haploids, which enter a haploid pool, fuse into\ndiploids, and then divide via the normal mitotic process. Haploid fusion is\nmodeled as a second-order rate process. When the cost for sex is small, as\nmeasured by the ratio of the characteristic haploid fusion time to the\ncharacteristic growth time, we find that sexual replication with random haploid\nfusion leads to a greater mean fitness for the population than a purely asexual\nstrategy. However, independently of the cost for sex, we find that sexual\nreplication with a selective mating strategy leads to a higher mean fitness\nthan the random mating strategy. This result is based on the assumption that a\nselective mating strategy does not have any additional time or energy costs\nover the random mating strategy, an assumption that is discussed in the paper.\nThe results of this paper are consistent with previous studies suggesting that\nsex is favored at intermediate mutation rates, for slowly replicating\norganisms, and at high population densities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Sep 2007 09:52:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-09-11"}

I will particularly focus on some\ninteresting relations between the Persian astronomical heritage and the\nAndalusian (Spanish) achievements in that period. After a brief introduction\ndealing mainly with a couple of terminological remarks, I will present a\nglimpse of the historical context in which Muslim science developed. In Section\n3, the origins of Muslim astronomy will be briefly examined. Section 4 will be\nconcerned with Khwarizmi, the Persian astronomer/mathematician who wrote the\nfirst major astronomical work in the Muslim world. His influence on later\nAndalusian astronomy will be looked into in Section 5. Andalusian astronomy\nflourished in the 11th century, as will be studied in Section 6. Among its\nmajor achievements were the Toledan Tables and the Alfonsine Tables, which will\nbe presented in Section 7. The Tables had a major position in European\nastronomy until the advent of Copernicus in the 16th century. Since Ptolemy's\nmodels were not satisfactory, Muslim astronomers tried to improve them, as we\nwill see in Section 8. This Section also shows how Andalusian astronomers took\npart in this effort, which was necessary in the path to the Scientific\nRevolution. Finally, Section 9 presents the Spanish influence on the eve of the\nRenaissance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Sep 2007 15:10:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-09-11"}
