We also model the measured cluster shear profile as a sum\nof contributions from the brightest central galaxy, the cluster dark matter\nhalo, and neighboring halos. We infer the relations between mean cluster virial\nmass and optical richness and luminosity over two orders of magnitude in\ncluster mass; the virial mass at fixed richness or luminosity is determined\nwith a precision of 13% including both statistical and systematic errors. We\nalso constrain the halo concentration parameter and halo bias as a function of\ncluster mass; both are in good agreement with predictions of LCDM models.

Although the necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor the production of a unique nonequilibrium steady state are unknown, if such\na steady state exists, the generation of the steady state fluctuation relation\nfrom the transient relation is shown to be very general.

In this paper we\nevaluate to which extent field star capture over a Hubble time may explain the\n'blue tilt'. We perform collisional N-body simulations to quantify the amount\nof field star capture occuring over a Hubble time to star clusters with 10^3 to\n10^6 stars. In the simulations we follow the orbits of field stars passing\nthrough a star cluster and calculate the energy change that the field stars\nexperience due to gravitational interaction with cluster stars during one\npassage through the cluster. The capture condition is that their total energy\nafter the passage is smaller than the gravitational potential at the cluster's\ntidal radius. By folding this with the fly-by rates of field stars with an\nassumed space density as in the solar neighbourhood and a range of velocity\ndispersions, we derive estimates on the mass fraction of captured field stars\nas a function of environment. We find that integrated over a Hubble time, the\nratio between captured field stars and total number of clusters stars is very\nlow (<~ 10^(-4)), even for the smallest considered field star velocity\ndispersion sigma=15 km/s.

We calculate stellar masses and photometric redshifts, based on\n~2,000 templates built with stellar and dust emission models fitting the\nUV-to-MIR SEDs of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts. We estimate stellar\nmass functions for different redshift intervals.

During the early embedded\nphase of protostellar disks, although embryos rapidly emerge in regions\ninterior to the ice line, uninhibited type-I migration leads to their efficient\nself-clearing. But, embryos continue to form from residual planetesimals at\nincreasingly large radii, repeatedly migrate inward, and provide a main channel\nof heavy element accretion onto their host stars. During the advanced stages of\ndisk evolution (a few Myr), the gas surface density declines to values\ncomparable to or smaller than that of the minimum mass nebula model and type-I\nmigration is no longer an effective disruption mechanism for mars-mass embryos.\nOver wide ranges of initial disk surface densities and type-I migration\nefficiency, the surviving population of embryos interior to the ice line has a\ntotal mass several times that of the Earth. With this reservoir, there is an\nadequate inventory of residual embryos to subsequently assemble into rocky\nplanets similar to those around the Sun. But, the onset of efficient gas\naccretion requires the emergence and retention of cores, more massive than a\nfew M_earth, prior to the severe depletion of the disk gas. The formation\nprobability of gas giant planets and hence the predicted mass and semimajor\naxis distributions of extrasolar gas giants are sensitively determined by the\nstrength of type-I migration. We suggest that the observed fraction of\nsolar-type stars with gas giant planets can be reproduced only if the actual\ntype-I migration time scale is an order of magnitude longer than that deduced\nfrom linear theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Sep 2007 12:36:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-09-11"}

Zeeman signatures are detected, both in\nphotospheric lines and in the emission lines formed at the base of the\naccretion funnels linking the disc to the protostar, and monitored over the\nwhole rotation cycle of V2129 Oph. We observe that rotational modulation\ndominates the temporal variations of both unpolarized and circularly polarized\nline profiles. We reconstruct the large-scale magnetic topology at the surface\nof V2129 Oph from both sets of Zeeman signatures simultaneously. We find it to\nbe rather complex, with a dominant octupolar component and a weak dipole of\nstrengths 1.2 and 0.35 kG, respectively, both slightly tilted with respect to\nthe rotation axis. The large-scale field is anchored in a pair of 2-kG unipolar\nradial field spots located at high latitudes and coinciding with cool dark\npolar spots at photospheric level. This large-scale field geometry is unusually\ncomplex compared to those of non-accreting cool active subgiants with moderate\nrotation rates. As an illustration, we provide a first attempt at modelling the\nmagnetospheric topology and accretion funnels of V2129 Oph using field\nextrapolation. We find that the magnetosphere of V2129 Oph must extend to about\n7R* to ensure that the footpoints of accretion funnels coincide with the\nhigh-latitude accretion spots on the stellar surface. It suggests that the\nstellar magnetic field succeeds in coupling to the accretion disc as far out as\nthe corotation radius, and could possibly explain the slow rotation of V2129\nOph. The magnetospheric geometry we derive produces X-ray coronal fluxes\ntypical of those observed in cTTSs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Sep 2007 14:56:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-09-11"}
