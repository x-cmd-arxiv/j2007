Their average\nlight profiles are potentially of great interest, since they may contain clues\nto the time since the onset of significant galaxy assembly. We separately\nco-add V, i' and z'-band HUDF images of sets of z~4,5 and 6 objects,\npre-selected to have nearly identical compact sizes and the roundest shapes.\n  From these stacked images, we are able to study the averaged radial structure\nof these objects at much higher signal-to-noise ratio than possible for an\nindividual faint object. Here we explore the reliability and usefulness of a\nstacking technique of compact objects at z~4-6 in the HUDF. Our results are:\n(1) image stacking provides reliable and reproducible average surface\nbrightness profiles; (2) the shape of the average surface brightness profiles\nshow that even the faintest z~4-6 objects are resolved; and (3) if late-type\ngalaxies dominate the population of galaxies at z~4-6, as previous HST studies\nhave shown, then limits to dynamical age estimates for these galaxies from\ntheir profile shapes are comparable with the SED ages obtained from the\nbroadband colors.

We propose new achievable rates based on elementary compression and\nalso on a Wyner-Ziv (CEO-like) processing, for both fast fading and block\nfading channels, as well as for general discrete channels. The simpler two\nagents scheme is solved, up to an implicit equation with a single variable.\nLimiting the nomadic transmitter to a circular-symmetric complex Gaussian\nsignalling, new upper bounds are derived for both fast and block fading, based\non the vector version of the entropy power inequality. These bounds are then\ncompared to the achievable rates in several extreme scenarios. The asymptotic\nsetting with numbers of agents and transmitter's antennas taken to infinity is\nanalyzed.

Three membranes are located at $z=-h$, $z=0$ and\n$z=h_1$. These membranes are impenetrable, except for the middle one at $z=0$,\nwhich has a narrow pore.

We show that in\nthis case $\\tau_d$ scales as $N^{2\\nu_{\\tinytext{2D}}}$, in agreement with\nseveral existing numerical results in the literature. This result violates the\nearlier reported lower bound $N^{1+\\nu}$ for $\\tau_d$ for field-driven\ntranslocation. We argue, based on energy conservation, that the actual lower\nbound for $\\tau_d$ is $N^{2\\nu}$ and not $N^{1+\\nu}$. Polymer translocation in\nsuch theoretically motivated geometries thus resolves some of the most\nfundamental issues that are the subjects of much heated debate in recent times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Sep 2007 15:22:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2007 11:31:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-29"}
