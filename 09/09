For this purpose, I calculate\nthe partial wave amplitude for the p-wave pion production (pp\\to pn\\pi^+) using\nthe pion production operator from the lowest and the next nonvanishing orders.\nThe operator includes a contact operator whose coupling has been fixed using a\nmatrix element of a low-energy weak process (pp\\to de^+\\nu_e). I find that this\noperator does not reproduce the partial wave amplitude extracted from\nexperimental data, showing that the bridging over the reactions with\nsignificantly different kinematics is not necessarily successful. I study the\ndependence of the amplitude on the various inputs such as the NN potential, the\n\\pi N\\Delta coupling, and the cutoff. I argue the importance of a higher order\ncalculation. In order to gain an insight into a higher order calculation, I add\na higher order counter term to the operator used above, and fit the couplings\nto both the low-energy weak process and the pion production. The energy\ndependence of the partial wave amplitude for the pion production is described\nby the operator consistently with the data. However, I find a result which\ntells us to be careful about the convergence of the chiral expansion for the\npp\\to pn\\pi^+ reaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Sep 2007 01:11:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2007 01:44:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 May 2008 19:17:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

If the thermophoretic force is\nstronger than gravity and cohesion, dust particles are ejected. Applied to\nprotoplanetary discs, dusty bodies smaller than several kilometres in size\nwhich are closer to a star than about 0.4 au are subject to a rapid and\ncomplete disassembly to submillimetre size dust aggregates by this process.\nWhile an inward-drifting dusty body is destroyed, the generated dust is not\nlost for the disc by sublimation or subsequent accretion on to the star but can\nbe reprocessed by photophoresis or radiation pressure.

The pentagram map, performed on N-gons, gives rise to a birational mapping\non the space of all N-gons. This paper finds what conjecturally are all the\ninvariants for this map, and along the way relates the construction to the\nmonodromy of 3rd order differential equations, and also to Dodgson's method of\ncondensation for computing determinants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Sep 2007 13:54:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-09-11"}

The survey is aimed primarily at\nidentifying new Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) from their spectroscopic\nsimilarity to known LBVs, avoiding the bias towards photometric variability,\nwhich may require centuries to manifest itself if LBVs go through long\nquiescent periods. Followup spectroscopy with WIYN confirms that our survey\ndetected a wealth of stars whose spectra are similar to the known LBVs. We\n\"classify\" the spectra of known LBVs, and compare these to the spectra of the\nnew LBV candidates. We demonstrate spectacular spectral variability for several\nof the new LBV candidates, such as AM2, previously classified as a Wolf-Rayet\nstar, which now shows FeI, FeII and Balmer emission lines but neither the NIII\n4634,42 nor HeII 4686 emission that it did in 1982. Profound spectral changes\nare also noted for other suspected and known LBVs. Several of the LBV\ncandidates also show >0.5 mag changes in V over the past 10-20 years. The\nnumber of known or suspected LBVs is now 24 in M31, 37 in M33, 1 in NGC 6822,\nand 3 in IC 10. We estimate that the total number of LBVs in M31 and M33 may be\nseveral hundred, in contrast to the 8 known historically through large-scale\nphotometric variability. This has significant implications for the time scale\nof the LBV phase.

Methods: We used a chi^2 procedure to constrain\nthe apparent magnitude of the host galaxy in archived HST images. Supposing\nthat the host galaxy is typical of BL Lac objects (M_{R} -22.8), a lower limit\nto the distance can be obtained from the limit on the apparent magnitude of the\nhost galaxy. Results: Using the 3 sigma limit on the host galaxy magnitude, the\nredshift is found to be greater or equal to 0.25. Conlusions: The redshift of\nPG 1553+11 is probably in the range z=0.3-0.4, making this object the most\ndistant extragalactic source so far detected in the TeV energies.
