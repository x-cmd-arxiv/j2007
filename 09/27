Many of these investigations require preparation of the mechanical\nsystem in or close to its quantum ground state. Remarkable progress in ground\nstate cooling has been achieved for trapped ions and atoms confined in optical\nlattices. Imperative to this progress has been the technique of resolved\nsideband cooling, which allows overcoming the inherent temperature limit of\nDoppler cooling and necessitates a harmonic trapping frequency which exceeds\nthe atomic species' transition rate. The recent advent of cavity back-action\ncooling of mechanical oscillators by radiation pressure has followed a similar\npath with Doppler-type cooling being demonstrated, but lacking inherently the\nability to attain ground state cooling as recently predicted. Here we\ndemonstrate for the first time resolved sideband cooling of a mechanical\noscillator. By pumping the first lower sideband of an optical microcavity,\nwhose decay rate is more than twenty times smaller than the eigen-frequency of\nthe associated mechanical oscillator, cooling rates above 1.5 MHz are attained.\nDirect spectroscopy of the motional sidebands reveals 40-fold suppression of\nmotional increasing processes, which could enable reaching phonon occupancies\nwell below unity (<0.03). Elemental demonstration of resolved sideband cooling\nas reported here should find widespread use in opto-mechanical cooling\nexperiments. Apart from ground state cooling, this regime allows realization of\nmotion measurement with an accuracy exceeding the standard quantum limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2007 18:29:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We select RAVE stars with radial velocities that are sensitive to\nthe Galactic vertical space velocity (Galactic latitude b < -45 deg). Kuiper\nstatistics have been employed to test the symmetry of the Galactic vertical\nvelocity distribution functions in these samples for evidence of a net vertical\nflow that could be associated with a (tidal?) stream of stars with vertically\ncoherent kinematics. In contrast to the `Field of Streams' found in the outer\nhalo, we find that the local volumes of the solar neighbourhood sampled by the\nCORAVEL dwarfs (complete within ~3 x 10^-4 kpc^3), CORAVEL giants (complete\nwithin ~5 x 10^-2 kpc^3) and RAVE (5-15% complete within ~8 kpc^3) are devoid\nof any vertically coherent streams containing hundreds of stars.

The lack of a net vertical\nflow through the solar neighbourhood in the CORAVEL giants and RAVE samples\nargues against the Virgo overdensity crossing the disc near the Sun.

We illustrate both the ontological model formalism and our\ngeneralization of it through a series of example models taken from the\nliterature.

Since 2002, the whole production of waste\nedible oils (around 100 000 tons per year in France) must be collected and\ntransformed into secondary raw material by specific companies. The general aim\nof the present work is to produce one of the following target sources of\nenergy: (i) H2 for fuel cells, (ii) H2/CO in satisfactory ratios to produce\nbiodiesel by Fischer-Tropsch (FT) reaction, or (iii) hydrocarbon mixtures with\nhigh added value.

In support of our\nknowledge related to fatty acids and methyl esters, a laboratory pilot plant\nwas built to study the pyrolysis of used frying oils. Effects of temperature\n(700-800 degrees C), residence time, addition of reaction initiator (H2O2) or\ninhibitor (thiophene), and diluent (water or nitrogen) were analysed with\nregard to the nature and amounts of pyrolysis products. Results led to the\nconclusion that the best operating conditions of pyrolysis are 800 degrees C\nwith water as diluent, leading to the production of dihydrogen (40%) and\nhydrocarbons from methane to propylene, essentially.

According to\nthe constructive Gelfand duality theorem of Banaschewski and Mulvey, the latter\nhas an internal spectrum S(A) in T(A), which in our approach plays the role of\na quantum phase space of the system. Thus we associate a locale (which is the\ntopos-theoretical notion of a space and which intrinsically carries the\nintuitionistic logical structure of a Heyting algebra) to a C*-algebra (which\nis the noncommutative notion of a space). In this setting, states on A become\nprobability measures (more precisely, valuations) on S(A), and self-adjoint\nelements of A define continuous functions (more precisely, locale maps) from\nS(A) to Scott's interval domain. Noting that open subsets of S(A) correspond to\npropositions about the system, the pairing map that assigns a (generalized)\ntruth value to a state and a proposition assumes an extremely simple\ncategorical form. Formulated in this way, the quantum theory defined by A is\nessentially turned into a classical theory, internal to the topos T(A).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2007 11:42:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Apr 2008 18:56:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2009 10:45:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-12"}

We propose a theory based on decomposing the relaxation of the\nmacroscopic dipole moment into contributions from hydrogen bonded clusters of\n$s$ molecules, with $s_{min}\\le s \\le s_{max}$. The existence of $s_{max}$ is\ndue to dynamical arrest and its value may depend on the cooling protocol and on\nthe aging time. The existence of $s_{max}$ is translated into a sum-rule on the\nconcentrations of clusters of size $s$. We construct the statistical mechanics\nof the super-cooled liquid subject to this sum-rule as a constraint, to\nestimate the temperature-dependent density of clusters of size $s$. With a\ntheoretical estimate of the relaxation time of each cluster we provide\npredictions for the real and imaginary part of the frequency dependent\ndielectric response. The predicted spectra and their temperature dependence are\nin accord with measurements, explaining a host of phenomenological fits like\nthe Vogel-Fulcher fit and the stretched exponential fit. Using glycerol as a\nparticular example we demonstrate quantitative correspondence between theory\nand experiments. The theory also demonstrates that the $\\alpha$ peak and the\n\"excess wing\" stem from the same physics in this material.

This mode of protein function assignment\nis mostly based on the detection of sequence similarity and the premise that\nfunctional properties are conserved during evolution. Most automatic approaches\ndeveloped to date rely on the identification of clusters of homologous proteins\nand the mapping of new proteins onto these clusters, which are expected to\nshare functional characteristics. RESULTS: Here, we inverse the logic of this\nprocess, by considering the mapping of sequences directly to a functional\nclassification instead of mapping functions to a sequence clustering. In this\nmode, the starting point is a database of labelled proteins according to a\nfunctional classification scheme, and the subsequent use of sequence similarity\nallows defining the membership of new proteins to these functional classes. In\nthis framework, we define the Correspondence Indicators as measures of\nrelationship between sequence and function and further formulate two Bayesian\napproaches to estimate the probability for a sequence of unknown function to\nbelong to a functional class. This approach allows the parametrisation of\ndifferent sequence search strategies and provides a direct measure of\nannotation error rates. We validate this approach with a database of enzymes\nlabelled by their corresponding four-digit EC numbers and analyse specific\ncases. CONCLUSION: The performance of this method is significantly higher than\nthe simple strategy consisting in transferring the annotation from the highest\nscoring BLAST match and is expected to find applications in automated\nfunctional annotation pipelines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2007 15:22:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-09-28"}
