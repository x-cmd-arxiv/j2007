Similarly, accretion\nleaves a deeper imprint on the distribution of black hole spins than black hole\nmergers do.

Realistic correlations were produced by modulating the\ninstantaneous firing probabilities of all stimulated neurons by a common\noscillatory input whose amplitude and temporal structure were consistent with\nexperimentally measured field potentials and correlograms. Whereas previous\nstudies have typically measured synergy between pairs of ganglion cells\nexamined one at a time, or alternatively have employed optimized linear filters\nto decode activity across larger populations, the present study investigated a\ndistributed, non-linear encoding strategy by using Principal Components\nAnalysis (PCA) to reconstruct simple visual stimuli from up to one million\noscillatory pairwise correlations extracted on single trials from\nmassively-parallel spike trains as short as 25 msec in duration.

The average D/H of carbonaceous chondrites (CC's) is known to be close\nto the current D/H of the Earth's ocean, while those of comets and the solar\nnebula are larger by about a factor of two and smaller by about a factor of\nseven, respectively, than that of the Earth's ocean. Thus, the main source of\nthe Earth's ocean has been thought to be CC's or adequate mixing of comets and\nthe solar nebula. However, those conclusions are correct only if D/H of water\non the Earth has remained unchanged for the past 4.5 Gyr. In this paper, we\ninvestigate evolution of D/H in the ocean in the case that the early Earth had\na hydrogen-rich atmosphere, the existence of which is predicted by recent\ntheories of planet formation no matter whether the nebula remains or not. Then\nwe show that D/H in the ocean increases by a factor of 2-9, which is caused by\nthe mass fractionation during atmospheric hydrogen loss, followed by deuterium\nexchange between hydrogen gas and water vapor during ocean formation. This\nresult suggests that the apparent similarity in D/H of water between CC's and\nthe current Earth's ocean does not necessarily support the CC's origin of water\nand that the apparent discrepancy in D/H is not a good reason for excluding the\nnebular origin of water.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2007 09:09:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

We focus on the role of\ngravitational torques in transporting mass inward and angular momentum outward\nduring different evolutionary phases of a protostellar disc with disc-to-star\nmass ratio of order 0.1. In the early phase, when the infall of matter from the\nsurrounding envelope is substantial, mass is transported inward by the\ngravitational torques from spiral arms that are a manifestation of the\nenvelope-induced gravitational instability in the disc. In the late phase, when\nthe gas reservoir of the envelope is depleted, the distinct spiral structure is\nreplaced by ongoing irregular nonaxisymmetric density perturbations. The\namplitude of these density perturbations decreases with time, though this\nprocess is moderated by swing amplification aided by the existence of the\ndisc's sharp outer edge. Our global modelling of the protostellar disc reveals\nthat there is typically a residual nonzero gravitational torque from these\ndensity perturbations, i.e. their effects do not exactly cancel out in each\nregion. In particular, the net gravitational torque in the inner disc tends to\nbe negative during first several million years of the evolution, while the\nouter disc has a net positive gravitational torque.

After a brief\nreview of the classical theory, this paper reports on a recent study of spiral\ngrowth in the presence of step edge barriers. Our key observation is that step\nedge barriers lead to unconventionally shaped spiral hillocks that display the\nsame characteristic ever-steepening height profiles as wedding cakes formed\nduring growth by two-dimensional nucleation. This prediction was verified\nexperimentally by inducing screw dislocations through ion bombardment of the\nPt(111) surface, thus creating a homoepitaxial growth system on which spiral\nhillocks and wedding cakes coexist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2007 11:55:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-03-20"}

One can\nuse holography to map the amplitude describing the hadronic state in the fifth\ndimension of Anti-de Sitter space to the light-front wavefunctions of hadrons\nin physical space-time, thus providing a relativistic description of hadrons in\nQCD at the amplitude level.

The chameleonic force between two nearby bodies is more akin to a\nCasimir-like force than a gravitational one: The chameleon force behaves as an\ninverse power of the distance of separation between the surfaces of two bodies,\njust as the Casimir force does. Additionally, experimental tests of gravity\noften employ a thin metallic sheet to shield electrostatic forces, however this\nsheet mask any detectable signal due to the presence of a strongly coupled\nchameleon field. As a result of this shielding, experiments that are designed\nto specifically test the behaviour of gravity are often unable to place any\nconstraint on chameleon fields with a strong coupling to matter. Casimir force\nmeasurements do not employ a physical electrostatic shield and as such are able\nto put tighter constraints on the properties of chameleons fields with a strong\nmatter coupling than tests of gravity. Motivated by this, we perform a full\ninvestigation on the possibility of testing chameleon model with both present\nand future Casimir experiments.

We show\nthat, quantum clique problem can be defined as follows; Given a quantum\nchannel, decide whether there are k states that are distinguishable, with no\nerror, after passing through channel. This definition comes from reconsidering\nthe clique problem in terms of the zero-error capacity of graphs, and then\nredefining it in quantum information theory.

The aim is to get an overall picture of the\nhot, warm and cold ISM of ETG, as a function of galaxy mass and environment, to\nunderstand its origin and fate, and to relate it to the formation and evolution\nhistory of these objects. Methods: This paper deals with the first part of our\nstudy, which is devoted to the 8-16 deg. declination strip in the Virgo\ncluster. In this sky region, using the Virgo Cluster Catalogue (VCC), we have\ndefined an optical sample of 939 ETG, 457 of which are brighter than the VCC\ncompleteness limit at B_T=18.0. We have correlated this optical sample with the\ncatalogue of detected HI sources from ALFALFA. Results: Out of the 389 ETG from\nthe VCC with B_T<=18.0, outside the 1 deg. region of poor HI detection around\nM87, and corrected for background contamination of VCC galaxies without a known\nradial velocity, only 9 galaxies (2.3%) are detected in HI with a completeness\nlimit of 3.5 and 7.6 x 10^7 Mo of HI for dwarf and giant ETG, respectively.
