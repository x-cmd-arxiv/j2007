The Gibbs scheme is modified aiming to describe the statistical\nproperties of a class of non-equilibrium and metastable states. The system is\nassumed to maximize the usual definition of the Entropy, subject to the\nstandard constant energy and norm restrictions, plus additional constraints.\nThe central assumption is that the existence of the considered metastable state\nis determined by the action of this additional dynamical constraint, that\nblocks the evolution of the system up to its maximum Entropy state, thus\nmaintaining it in the metastable or stationary configuration. After requiring\nfrom the statistical description to be valid for the combination of two nearly\nindependent subsystems, it follows that the eigenvalues of the constraint\noperators C should have the restricted homogeneous form C(p{i})=p{i}^{q}, in\nterms of the eigenvalues of the density matrix p{i}, where q is a fixed real\nnumber. Therefore, the distribution of the eigenvalues of the constraint\nfunction have the Tsallis structure. This conclusion suggests the\ninterpretation of the q parameter as reflecting the homogeneous dependence of\nthe constraint determining the metastable state on the density matrix. An\napplication to the plasma experiments of Huang and Driscoll is expected to be\nconsidered elsewhere in order to compare the results with Tsallis scheme and\nthe minimal Enstrophy one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Sep 2007 20:08:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-09-04"}
