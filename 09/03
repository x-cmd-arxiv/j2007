Presently researchers concerned with nonequilibrium\nprocesses have turned back to Fermat's idea in the form of the maximum entropy\nproduction principle (MEPP). MEPP has proved to be good for understanding and\ndescription of diverse nonequilibrium processes in physics, chemistry and\nbiology. This brings up two questions: 1) Can this principle claim to be the\nbasis of all nonequilibrium physics? 2) Is it possible to prove MEPP?\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Sep 2007 06:17:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-09-04"}

Two\nboundary conditions are taken into account: periodic boundary conditions (where\nthe nth oscillator is coupled back to the first oscillator) and fixed wall\nboundary conditions (where the first oscillator and the $n$th oscillator are\ncoupled to a fixed wall). The two systems are characterized by their\nHamiltonian. For their quantization, we treat these systems as Wigner Quantum\nSystems (WQS), allowing more solutions than just the canonical quantization\nsolution. In this WQS approach, one is led to certain algebraic relations for\noperators (which are linear combinations of position and momentum operators)\nthat should satisfy triple relations involving commutators and\nanti-commutators. These triple relations have a solution in terms of the Lie\nsuperalgebra gl(1|n). We study a particular class of gl(1|n) representations\nV(p), the so-called ladder representations. For these representations, we\ndetermine the spectrum of the Hamiltonian and of the position operators (for\nboth types of boundary conditions). Furthermore, we compute the eigenvectors of\nthe position operators in terms of stationary states. This leads to explicit\nexpressions for position probabilities of the n oscillators in the chain. An\nanalysis of the plots of such position probability distributions gives rise to\nsome interesting observations. In particular, the physical behavior of the\nsystem as a WQS is very much in agreement with what one would expect from the\nclassical case, except that all physical quantities (energy, position and\nmomentum of each oscillator) have a finite spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Sep 2007 09:43:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

After investigating for possible Wolf-Rayet emission features\nin our spectra, we consider dubious the classification of HG031203 as a\nWolf-Rayet galaxy. Long gamma-ray burst (LGRB) and supernova hosts in the local\nuniverse (z<0.2) show, on average, specific star formation rates higher than\nordinary star forming galaxy at the same redshift. On the other hand, we find\nthat half of the hosts follows the metallicity-luminosity relation found for\nstar-burst galaxies; HG031203 is a clear outlier, with its really low\nmetallicity (12+\\log{{O/H}}=8.12+/-0.04).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Sep 2007 11:55:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Sep 2007 08:51:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-27"}

In order to avoid a negative norm state, we must associate the creation\noperator of the ghost mode with a negative-energy mode function instead of a\npositive-energy one as the mode function. Namely, we have to adopt a different\nprocedure of quantization for a ghost. When a theory has a symmetry mixing a\nghost mode with ordinary non-ghost modes, the choice of a ghost mode is not\nunique. However, quantization of a ghost is impossible without specifying a\nchoice of ghost mode, which breaks the symmetry. For this reason, the vacuum\nstate cannot respect the symmetry. In the massive gravity theory with a\ngraviton ghost mode in de Sitter background, the ghost is the helicity-0 mode\nof the graviton. This ghost mode is mixed with the other helicity graviton\nmodes under the action of de Sitter symmetry. Therefore, there is no de Sitter\ninvariant vacuum in such models. This leads to an interesting possibility that\nnon-covariant cutoff of the low energy effective theory may naturally arise. As\na result, the instability due to the pair production of a ghost and normal\nnon-ghost particles gets much milder and that the model may escape from being\nrejected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Sep 2007 11:55:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2007 10:05:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-20"}

Numerical solutions of the Clark-alpha model are\ncompared to two previously employed regularizations, LANS-alpha and Leray-alpha\n(at Re ~ 3300, Taylor Re ~ 790) and to a DNS. We derive the Karman-Howarth\nequation for both the Clark-alpha and Leray-alpha models.

At sub-filter scales, Clark-alpha possesses\nsimilar total dissipation and characteristic time to reach a statistical\nturbulent steady-state as Navier-Stokes, but exhibits greater intermittency. As\na SGS model, Clark reproduces the energy spectrum and intermittency properties\nof the DNS. For the Leray model, increasing the filter width decreases the\nnonlinearity and the effective Re is substantially decreased. Even for the\nsmallest value of alpha studied, Leray-alpha was inadequate as a SGS model. The\nLANS energy spectrum k^1, consistent with its so-called \"rigid bodies,\"\nprecludes a reproduction of the large-scale energy spectrum of the DNS at high\nRe while achieving a large reduction in resolution.

METHODS:\nThe Submillimeter Array (SMA) has observed the high-mass star forming region\nAFGL 2591 in lines of CS, SO, HCN, HCN(v2=1), and HC15N with 0.6\" resolution at\n350 GHz probing radial scales of 600-3500 AU for an assumed distance of 1 kpc.\nThe SMA observations are compared with the predictions of a chemical model\nfitted to previous single-dish observations. RESULTS: The CS and SO main peaks\nare extended in space at the FWHM level, as predicted in the model assuming\nprotostellar X-rays. However, the main peak sizes are found smaller than\nmodeled by nearly a factor of 2. On the other hand, the lines of CS, HCN, and\nHC15N, but not SO and HCN(v2=1), show pedestal emissions at radii of about 3500\nAU that are not predicted.

Our results are summarised as follows:\nbulges that form early have larger starburst fraction and hence should be\nsmaller than their counter parts that form later. The quiescent fraction in\nbulges is an increasing function of bulge mass, becoming constant at\n$M_{\\rm{q}}/M_{\\rm{bul}} \\sim 0.8$, mainly due to the infall of satellite\ngalaxies that contribute disc stars to the bulge.
