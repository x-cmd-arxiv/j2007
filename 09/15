PG\n2112+059 was found in a deep minimum state as its 0.2-12 keV flux decreased by\na factor of 10 in comparison to the May 2003 observation. During the deep\nminimum state the spectra show strong emission in excess of the continuum in\nthe 3-6 keV region. The excess emission corresponds to an EW = 26.1 keV whereas\nits shape resembles that of heavily absorbed objects. The spectra of both\nobservations of PG 2112+059 can be explained statistically by a combination of\ntwo absorbers where one shows a high column density, $N_{H} \\sim 4.5 \\times\n10^{23} cm^{-2}$, and the other high ionisation parameters.

Apart from the 24 micron\npassband, all sample-averaged radial color profiles have measurable slopes\nwithin about twice the (K band) effective radius. Evidently this variation\narises because of an increase in stellar metallicity toward the galactic cores.\nFor example, the sampled-averaged color profile (K - 5.8 microns) has a\npositive slope although no obvious absorption feature is observed in spectra of\nelliptical galaxies near 5.8 microns. This, and the minimum in the effective\nradius, suggests that the K band may be anomalously luminous in metal-rich\nstars in galaxy cores.
