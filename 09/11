This result agrees\nqualitatively with the predictions of models in which Thermally Pulsing\nAsymptotic Giant Branch (TP-AGB) stars dominate the H and K-band light of a\ngalaxy following a burst of star formation. We also find a surprisingly strong\ncorrelation between the near-IR colours of star-forming galaxies and their dust\nattenuation as measured from the Balmer decrement. Unlike optical colours,\nhowever, near-IR colours exhibit very little dependence on galaxy inclination.\nThis suggests that the correlation of near-IR colours with dust attenuation\narises because TP-AGB stars are the main source of dust in the galaxy.

There is a fundamental difference between\nthe classical expressions for the retarded potential and field: while the\nboundary contribution for the potential can always be made zero via a gauge\ntransformation preserving the Lorenz condition, that for the field may be\nneglected only if it diminishes with distance faster than the contribution of\nthe source density in the far zone. In the case of a rotating superluminal\nsource, however, the boundary term in the retarded solution for the field is by\na factor of order R^(1/2) larger than the source term of this solution in the\nlimit, which explains why an argument based on the solution of the wave\nequation governing the field that neglects the boundary term (such as that\npresented by J.

The two notions are equivalent to clique-width.

A cubic-time algorithm to decide whether a\nF-colored graph has F-rank-width (resp. F-bi-rank-width) at most k, for fixed\nk, is also given.

The planetesimals accretion rate was\ncoupled in a self-consistent way to the envelope's evolution. Results. We\nperformed several simulations for the formation of a Jupiter-like object by\nassuming various surface densities for the protoplanetary disc and two\ndifferent sizes for the accreted planetesimals. We find that the atmospheric\ngas drag gives rise to a major enhancement on the effective capture radius of\nthe protoplanet, thus leading to an average timescale reduction of 30% -- 55%\nand ultimately to an increase by a factor of 2 of the final mass of solids\naccreted as compared to the situation in which drag effects are neglected. With\nregard to the size of accreted planetesimals, we find that for a swarm of\nplanetesimals having a radius of 10 km, the formation time is a factor 2 to 3\nshorter than that of planetesimals of 100 km, the factor depending on the\nsurface density of the nebula.

We construct a model of the gaseous\ncontent in which the absorption equivalent width W_r is determined by the the\namount of cold gas, in the form of discrete clouds, along a sightline through a\nhalo. The two quantities that we specify per halo in the model are (1) the mean\nabsorption strength per unit surface mass density A_W(M), and (2) the mean\ncovering factor kappa_g(M) of the gaseous clouds. These parameters determine\nthe conditional probability distribution of W_r as a function of halo mass,\nP(W_r|M). Two empirical measurements are applied to constrain the model: (i)\nthe absorber frequency distribution function and (ii) the W_r-dependent\nclustering amplitude. We find that the data demand a rapid transition in the\ngas content of halos at ~10^11.5 Msol/h, below which halos contain\npredominantly cold gas and beyond which gas becomes predominantly hot. In order\nto reproduce the observed overall strong clustering of the absorbers and the\nanti-correlation between W_r and halo mass M, roughly 5% of gas in halos up to\n10^14 Msol/h is required to be cold. The gas covering factor is near unity over\na wide range of halo mass, supporting that Mg II systems probe an unbiased\nsample of typical galaxies.

This conversion\nis based on a constant initial mass function (IMF) independent of the total\nSFR. As recently recognised the maximum stellar mass in a star cluster is\nlimited by the embedded total cluster mass and, in addition, the maximum\nembedded star cluster mass is constrained by the current SFR. The combination\nof these two relations leads to an integrated galaxial initial stellar mass\nfunction (IGIMF, the IMF for the whole galaxy) which is steeper in the high\nmass regime than the constant canonical IMF, and is dependent on the SFR of the\ngalaxy. Consequently, the L_Halpha-SFR relation becomes non-linear and flattens\nfor low SFRs. Especially for dwarf galaxies the SFRs can be underestimated by\nup to three orders of magnitude. We revise the existing linear L_Halpha-SFR\nrelations using our IGIMF notion. These are likely to lead to a revision of the\ncosmological star formation histories. We also demonstrate that in the case of\nthe Sculptor dwarf irregular galaxies the IGIMF-formalism implies a linear\ndependence of the total SFR on the total galaxy gas mass. A constant gas\ndepletion time scale of a few Gyrs results independently of the galaxy gas mass\nwith a reduced scatter compared to the conventional results.

The low intrinsic polarization (~0.2%) at the first\nepoch is consistent with an almost spherical (<10% deviation from spherical\nsymmetry) hydrogen dominated ejecta. Similar to SN 1987A and to Type IIP SNe, a\nsharp increase in the degree of the polarization (~1%) is observed when the\nouter hydrogen layer becomes optically thin by day 31; only at this epoch is\nthe polarization well described by a ``dominant axis.'' The polarization angle\nof the data shows a rotation through ~40 degrees between the first and second\nepochs, indicating that the asymmetries of the first epoch were not directly\ncoupled with those observed at the second epoch. For the most polarized lines,\nwe observe wavelength-dependent loop structures in addition to the dominant\naxis on the Q-U plane. We show that the polarization properties of Type IIb SNe\nare roughly similar to one another, but with significant differences arising\ndue to line blending effects especially with the high velocities observed for\nSN 2001ig. This suggests that the geometry of SN 2001ig is related to SN 1993J\nand that these events may have arisen from a similar binary progenitor system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Sep 2007 21:10:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

This is an analogue of an\ninsulator-metal transition, since the system goes from being an insulator with\nzero current (in the applied field) to a conductor with free charge carriers\n(the quarks). At finite temperature this phenomenon persists, with the\ndissociation transition become subsumed into the more familiar meson melting\ntransition. Here, the dissociation phenomenon reduces the critical melting\ntemperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2007 09:44:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Sep 2008 00:24:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 21 Sep 2008 17:49:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-11"}

So far,\nmost attempts to model the effects of high-redshift microlensing by a\ncosmologically distributed population of MACHOs have assumed the compact\nobjects to be randomly and uniformly distributed along the line of sight. Here,\nwe present a more realistic model, in which the MACHOs are assumed to follow\nthe spatial clustering of cold dark matter. Because of sightline-to-sightline\nvariations in surface mass density, this scenario leads to substantial scatter\nin MACHO optical depths, which we quantify as a function of source redshift. We\nfind that while optical depth estimates based on a uniform line-of-sight\ndistribution are reasonable for the highest-redshift light sources, such\nestimates can be incorrect by a factor of ~2 for the nearby (z~0.25) Universe.\nHence, attempts to derive the cosmological density of MACHOs from microlensing\nobservations of only a few independent sightlines can be subject to substantial\nuncertainties. We also apply this model to the prediction of\nmicrolensing-induced variability in quasars not subject to macrolensing, and\ndemonstrate that relaxing the assumption of randomly and uniformly distributed\nMACHOs only has a modest impact on the predicted light curve amplitudes.

Methods: The Stokes profiles of four visible and three infrared\nspectral lines are subject to inversions based on simple one-component models\nas well as more sophisticated realizations of penumbral flux tubes embedded in\na static ambient field (uncombed models). Results: According to the\none-component inversions, the EC phenomenon can be understood as a perturbation\nof the magnetic and dynamic configuration of the penumbral filaments along\nwhich these structures move. The uncombed inversions, on the other hand,\nsuggest that ECs are the result of enhancements in the visibility of penumbral\nflux tubes.

It is found\nthat the average fidelity of teleportation and the range of states to be\nteleported depend on the type and rate of the damping in the channel. Using the\nfully entangled fraction, we derive two bounds on the damping rates of the\nchannels: one is to beat the classical limit and the second is to guarantee the\nnon-existence of any other copy with better fidelity. Effect of the initially\ndistributed maximally entangled state on the process is presented; and the\nconcurrence and the fully entangled fraction of the shared states are\ndiscussed. We intend to show that prior information on the dissipative channel\nand the range of qubit states to be teleported is helpful for the evaluation of\nthe success of teleportation, where success is defined as surpassing the\nfidelity limit imposed by the fidelity of 1-to-2 optimal cloning machine for\nthe specific range of qubits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2007 15:30:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-11-17"}

Analyses of this kind have been done\nat lower centre--of--mass energies and have shown that, once the appropriate\nkinematic variables are chosen, particle production is characterized by\nuniversal properties: no matter the nature of the interacting particles, the\nfinal states have identical features. Assuming that this universality picture\ncan be extended to {\\it ion--ion} collisions, as suggested by recent results\nfrom RHIC experiments, a novel approach based on the scaling hypothesis for\nlimiting fragmentation has been used to derive the expected charged event\nmultiplicity in $AA$ interactions at LHC. This leads to scenarios where the\nmultiplicity is significantly lower compared to most of the predictions from\nthe models currently used to describe high energy $AA$ collisions.

The Standard Model, while providing a\nsuccessful framework for the electroweak and strong interactions still needs to\nbe developed further to fully account fot the mass of strong interaction data\ncollected over the decades. A multitude of new phenomena have been discovered\nhowever, or predicted theoretically, in the physics of very low temperatures\n(e.g. fractional Hall effect, Bose-Einstein condensation) and quantum\nmacroscopic effects (liquid crystals, high temperature superconductivity), some\nof which remain to be fully explained. Therefore if there is any \"Trouble with\nPhysics\", as implied by the author of this book, it mainly concerns speculative\nwork on Superstring theory, which may or may not turn out to agree with the\nresults of observation.
