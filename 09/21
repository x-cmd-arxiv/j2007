Here, we give the\nmicroscopic derivation. The solution reveals a new mechanism of confinement in\nQCD(adj) in the regime where we have control over both perturbative and\nnonperturbative aspects. In particular, consider SU(2) QCD(adj) theory with $1\n\\leq n_f \\leq 4$ Majorana fermions, a theory which undergoes gauge symmetry\nbreaking at small $S^1$. If the magnetic charge of the BPS monopole is\nnormalized to unity, we show that confinement occurs due to condensation of\nobjects with magnetic charge 2, not 1. Because of index theorems, we know that\nsuch an object cannot be a two identical monopole configuration. Its net\ntopological charge must vanish, and hence it must be topologically\nindistinguishable from the perturbative vacuum. We construct such non-self-dual\ntopological excitations, the magnetically charged, topologically null molecules\nof a BPS monopole and ${\\bar{\\rm KK}}$ antimonopole, which we refer to as\nmagnetic bions. An immediate puzzle with this proposal is the apparent Coulomb\nrepulsion between the BPS-${\\bar{\\rm KK}}$ pair. An attraction which overcomes\nthe Coulomb repulsion between the two is induced by $2n_f$-fermion exchange.\nBion condensation is also the mechanism of confinement in $\\N=1$ SYM on the\nsame four-manifold. The SU(N) generalization hints a possible hidden\nintegrability behind nonsupersymmetric QCD of affine Toda type, and allows us\nto analytically compute the mass gap in the gauge sector.

Thus the photons emitted from\ndifferent sources will not be perfectly identical, and there will be some\nvariation in their frequencies. Here, we analyse the effect of this frequency\nmismatch on QIP schemes. As examples, we consider the distributed QIP protocol\nproposed by Barrett and Kok, and Hong-Ou-Mandel interference which lies at the\nheart of many linear optical schemes for quantum computing. In the distributed\nQIP protocol, we find that the fidelity of entangled qubit states depends\ncrucially on the time resolution of single photon detectors. In particular,\nthere is no reduction in the fidelity when an ideal detector model is assumed,\nwhile reduced fidelities may be encountered when using realistic detectors with\na finite response time. We obtain similar results in the case of Hong-Ou-Mandel\ninterference -- with perfect detectors, a modified version of quantum\ninterference is seen, and the visibility of the interference pattern is reduced\nas the detector time resolution is reduced.

This pre-Galactic (but\nnon-primordial) lithium should contribute to the primordial 7Li measured in\nhalo stars and must be subtracted in order to arrive to the true observed\nprimordial lithium abundance. In this paper we point out that the recent halo\nstar 6Li measurements can be used to place a strong constraint to the level of\nsuch contamination, because the exclusive astrophysical production of 6Li is\nfrom cosmic-ray interactions. We find that the putative 6Li plateau, if due to\npre-Galactic cosmic-ray interactions, implies that SFCR-produced lithium\nrepresents Li_{SFCR}/Li_{plateau}\\approx 15% of the observed elemental Li\nplateau. Taking the remaining plateau Li to be cosmological 7Li, we find a\nrevised (and slightly worsened) discrepancy between the Li observations and Big\nBang Nucleosynthesis predictions by a factor of ^7Li_{BBN}/^7Li_{plateau}\n\\approx 3.7. Moreover, SFCRs would also contribute to the extragalactic\ngamma-ray background (EGRB) through neutral pion production.

(2005) used the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) UV imaging\nsurvey to show that there exists a rare population of nearby compact\nUV-luminous galaxies (UVLGs) that closely resembles high redshift Lyman break\ngalaxies (LBGs). We present HST images in the UV, optical, and Ha, and\nresimulate them at the depth and resolution of the GOODS/UDF fields to show\nthat the morphologies of UVLGs are also similar to those of LBGs. Our sample of\n8 LBG analogs thus provides detailed insight into the connection between star\nformation and LBG morphology. Faint tidal features or companions can be seen in\nall of the rest-frame optical images, suggesting that the starbursts are the\nresult of a merger or interaction. The UV/optical light is dominated by\nunresolved (~100-300 pc) super starburst regions (SSBs). A detailed comparison\nwith the galaxies Haro 11 and VV 114 at z=0.02 indicates that the SSBs\nthemselves consist of diffuse stars and (super) star clusters. The structural\nfeatures revealed by the new HST images occur on very small physical scales and\nare thus not detectable in images of high redshift LBGs, except in a few cases\nwhere they are magnified by gravitational lensing. We propose, therefore, that\nLBGs are mergers of gas-rich, relatively low-mass (~10^10 Msun) systems, and\nthat the mergers trigger the formation of SSBs. If galaxies at high redshifts\nare dominated by SSBs, then the faint end slope of the luminosity function is\npredicted to have slope alpha~2.

The discovery\nthat both the retrograde and prograde free core nutations are in free decay\n(Palmer and Smylie, 2005) allows direct measures of viscosity at the top of the\nouter core, while the reduction in the rotational splitting of the two\nequatorial translational modes of the inner core allows it to be measured at\nthe bottom. We find 2,371 plus/minus 1,530 Pa.s at the top and 1.247 plus/minus\n0.035 x 10^11 Pa.s at the bottom.

We analyzed all high resolution X-ray\nspectra by fitting photoionization and absorption models from the most recent\nversion of the XSTAR code.

The folding\nkinetics of these proteins is usually explored via mutational analysis. A\ncentral question is which structural information on the transition state can be\nderived from the mutational data. In this article, we model and structurally\ninterpret mutational Phi-values for two small beta-sheet proteins, the PIN and\nthe FBP WW domain. The native structure of these WW domains comprises two\nbeta-hairpins that form a three-stranded beta-sheet. In our model, we assume\nthat the transition state consists of two conformations in which either one of\nthe hairpins is formed. Such a transition state has been recently observed in\nMolecular Dynamics folding-unfolding simulations of a small designed\nthree-stranded beta-sheet protein. We obtain good agreement with the\nexperimental data (i) by splitting up the mutation-induced free-energy changes\ninto terms for the two hairpins and for the small hydrophobic core of the\nproteins, and (ii) by fitting a single parameter, the relative degree to which\nhairpin 1 and 2 are formed in the transition state. The model helps to\nunderstand how mutations affect the folding kinetics of WW domains, and\ncaptures also negative Phi-values that have been difficult to interpret.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2007 09:11:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Following Zimanyi's lines of\nreasoning we show that kinetic freeze-out necessarily leads to a dependence of\nthe corresponding freeze-out temperature on collision centrality. This\ncentrality dependence can be predicted within hydrodynamic models, and for\nAu+Au collisions at RHIC this prediction is shown to reproduce the\nexperimentally observed centrality dependence of the thermal decoupling\ntemperature, extracted from hadron momentum spectra. The fact that no such\ncentrality dependence is observed for the chemical decoupling temperature,\nextracted from the hadron yields measured in these collisions, excludes a\nsimilar kinetic interpretation of the chemical decoupling process. We argue\nthat the chemical decoupling data from Au+Au collisions at RHIC can only be\nconsistently understood if the chemical freeze-out process is driven by a phase\ntransition, and that the measured chemical decoupling temperature therefore\nmeasures the critical temperature of the quark-hadron phase transition.

In contrast with the\naccretion flows onto black holes (BHs), we find that the shell-shaped\nhigh-density regions form around the NSs, since the radiation force is enhanced\nin the innermost regions. The enhanced radiation force drives strong outflows\nabove and below the disk. The mass-accretion rate onto the NS exceeds the\ncritical rate, $L_{\\rm E}/c^2$, with $L_{\\rm E}$ being the Eddington\nluminosity. However it is about $20-30%$ of that onto the BH, under the\ncondition that we employ the same mass-input rate, $\\dot{M}_{\\rm input}$, which\nis mass injected from the outer disk boundary per unit time. The mass-outflow\nrate is a few-times larger in flows around NSs than in flows around BHs. The\nsupercritical NS accretion flows mainly release the accretion energy as the\nkinetic energy of the outflows, though the disk luminosity is predominant over\nthe kinetic energy output rate in the BH accretion flows. The resulting\nvelocity and mass-outflow rate of the outflows are $0.2-0.3c$ and\n$150-700L_{\\rm E}/c^2$, respectively, for the mass-input rate of $3\\times\n10^2\\lsim \\dot{M}_{\\rm input}/(L_{\\rm E}/c^2)\\lsim 3\\times 10^3$.

Nebular analysis indicates that the\nknots have an LMC-like metallicity of 12 + log(O/H) = 8.29 +/- 0.09. According\nto continuum subtracted H alpha ACS imaging, cluster 1 dominates the nebular\nemission of the brighter knot A. Conversely, negligible nebular emission in\nknot B originates from cluster 6.

The huge, well-characterised scatter of the [n-capture/Fe] ratios in\nour EMP stars is in stark contrast to the negligible dispersion in the\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] and [Fe-peak/Fe] ratios for the same stars found in Paper V.\nThese results demonstrate that a second (``weak'' or LEPP) $r$-process\ndominates the production of the lighter neutron-capture elements for [Ba/H] $<\n-2.5$. The combination of very consistent [$\\alpha$/Fe] and erratic\n[n-capture/Fe] ratios indicates that inhomogeneous models for the early\nevolution of the halo are needed. Our accurate data provide strong constraints\non future models of the production and mixing of the heavy elements in the\nearly Galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2007 14:59:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We find that the color distribution of AGN host galaxies is\nhighly dependent upon (1) the strong color-evolution of luminous (M_V < -20.7)\ngalaxies, and (2) the influence of ~10 Mpc scale structures. When excluding\ngalaxies within the redshift range 0.63 < z < 0.76, a regime dominated by\nsources in large-scale structures at z=0.67 and z=0.73, we observe a bimodality\nin the host galaxy colors. Galaxies hosting AGN at z > 0.8 preferentially have\nbluer (rest-frame U-V < 0.7) colors than their z <~ 0.6 counterparts (many of\nwhich fall along the red sequence). The fraction of galaxies hosting AGN peaks\nin the ``green valley'' (0.5 < U-V < 1.0); this is primarily due to enhanced\nAGN activity in the redshift interval 0.63 < z < 0.76. The AGN fraction in this\nredshift and color interval is 12.8% (compared to its `field' value of 7.8%)\nand reaches a maximum of 14.8% at U-V~0.8. We further find that blue,\nbulge-dominated (Sersic index n>2.5) galaxies have the highest fraction of AGN\n(21%) in our sample. We explore the scenario that the evolution of AGN hosts is\ndriven by galaxy mergers and illustrate that an accurate assessment requires a\nlarger area survey since only three hosts may be undergoing a merger with\ntimescales <1 Gyr following a starburst phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2007 14:52:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Mar 2008 19:01:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
