In fact, they represent the most populous class of\nGalactic sources at TeV energies. In addition, HESS has also discovered, in a\nsurvey of the Galactic plane, a population of TeV gamma-ray sources that are\nstill without definitive counterparts at longer wavelengths. For a number of\nthese sources, a pulsar is an evident association, which is often located\nwithin an extended region of the TeV gamma-ray emission. These particular HESS\nsources are promising candidates for yet not resolved pulsar wind nebulae. Here\nwe have undertaken a systematic search for X-ray counterparts of the sources,\nusing the archival Chandra data, within the spatial bounds of the unidentified\nHESS sources. A number of X-ray sources have been detected in the Chandra\nfields. Two of them, CXOU J161729.3-505512 and CXOU J170252.4-412848, are of a\nspecial interest because of their excellent positional coincidence with the\npulsars PSR J1617-5055 and PSR J1702-4128, respectively. The first source is\nextended, with a bright core of 2.6 arcsec (FWHM) in radius but the emission\ncan be seen up to roughly 20 arcsec. The second one is much fainter and\ndetected only with marginal significance (4.6 sigma). It might also be slightly\nextended, although the situation is quite uncertain due to very limited\nstatistics. The analysis of the archival Chandra data for a middle-aged pulsar\n(PSR J1913+1011) does not reveal any statistically significant excess at and\naround the position of the pulsar or the center of gravity of its plausible TeV\ngamma-ray counterpart (HESS J1912+101).

We show that XH3+ complexes\nform very stable structures in the gas phase and that their binding energies\nare much higher than those involved in the structures of X-H2O hydrates or pure\nX-X condensates. This implies that, in presence of H3+ ions, argon, krypton or\nxenon are likely to remain sequestrated in the form of XH3+ complexes embedded\nin the gas phase rather than forming ices during the cooling of protoplanetary\ndisks. The amount of the deficiency depends on how much H3+ is available and\nefficient in capturing noble gases. In the dense gas of the mid-plane of solar\nnebula, H3+ is formed by the ionization of H2 from energetic particles, as\nthose in cosmic rays or those ejected by the young Sun. Even using the largest\nestimate of the cosmic rays ionization rate, we compute that the H3+ abundance\nis two and three orders of magnitude lower than the xenon and krypton\nabundance, respectively. Estimating the ionization induced by the young Sun, on\nthe other hand, is very uncertain but leaves the possibility to have enough H3+\nto make krypton and xenon trapping efficent.

Using XMM-Newton and\nChandra observations we probe the spatial distribution and the temperature of\nthe cluster gas. We find that more than 60 per cent of powerful radio sources\nin the redshift range of our sample lie in a cluster of X-ray luminosity\ngreater than 10^44 erg/s, and all but one of the narrow-line radio galaxies,\nfor which the emission from the nucleus is obscured by a torus, lie in a\ncluster environment. Within the statistical uncertainties we find no\nsignificant difference in the properties of the environment as a function of\nthe orientation to the line of sight of the radio jet. This is in agreement\nwith unification schemes. Our results have important implications for cluster\nsurveys, as clusters around powerful radio sources tend to be excluded from\nX-ray and Sunyaev-Zeldovich surveys of galaxy clusters, and thus can introduce\nan important bias in the cluster luminosity function. Most of the radio sources\nare found close to pressure balance with the environment in which they lie, but\nthe two low-excitation radio galaxies of the sample are observed to be\nunder-pressured. This may be the first observational indication for the\npresence of non-radiative particles in the lobes of some powerful radio\ngalaxies. We find that the clusters around radio sources in the redshift range\nof our sample have a steeper entropy-temperature relation than local clusters,\nand the slope is in agreement with the predictions of self-similar\ngravitational heating models for cluster gas infall. This suggests that\nselection by AGN finds systems less affected by AGN feedback than the local\naverage.(Abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Sep 2007 13:05:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The number of variables hopefully can be reduced, by using either\nprojection techniques or selection methods; the latter allow for the\ninterpretation of the selected variables. Since the optimal approach of testing\nall possible subsets of variables with the prediction model is intractable, an\nincremental selection approach using a nonparametric statistics is a good\noption, as it avoids the computationally intensive use of the model itself. It\nhas two drawbacks however: the number of groups of variables to test is still\nhuge, and colinearities can make the results unstable. To overcome these\nlimitations, this paper presents a method to select groups of spectral\nvariables. It consists in a forward-backward procedure applied to the\ncoefficients of a B-Spline representation of the spectra. The criterion used in\nthe forward-backward procedure is the mutual information, allowing to find\nnonlinear dependencies between variables, on the contrary of the generally used\ncorrelation. The spline representation is used to get interpretability of the\nresults, as groups of consecutive spectral variables will be selected. The\nexperiments conducted on NIR spectra from fescue grass and diesel fuels show\nthat the method provides clearly identified groups of selected variables,\nmaking interpretation easy, while keeping a low computational load. The\nprediction performances obtained using the selected coefficients are higher\nthan those obtained by the same method applied directly to the original\nvariables and similar to those obtained using traditional models, although\nusing significantly less spectral variables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Sep 2007 14:08:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-09-26"}

Twenty-three spectra have been obtained\nwith the MMT, 14 of which show broad emission. The remaining 21 spectra with\nbroad emission have been selected from the Data Release 5 of the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey. The most plausible origin of broad line emission is the evolution\nof massive stars and their interaction with the circumstellar and interstellar\nmedium. The broad emission with the lowest H$\\alpha$ luminosities (10^36 -\n10^39 erg/s) is likely produced in circumstellar envelopes around hot Ofp/WN9\nand/or LBV stars. The broad emission with the highest Halpha luminosities\n(10^40 - 10^42 erg/s) probably arises from type IIp or type IIn supernovae\n(SNe). It can also come from active galactic nuclei (AGN) containing\nintermediate-mass black holes, although we find no strong evidence for hard\nnon-thermal radiation in our sample galaxies.
