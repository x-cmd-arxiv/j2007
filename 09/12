In the first half of the present work\nthe abstract framework of \\cite{uno} is extended, so as to be applicable to\nevolutionary PDEs whose nonlinearities contain derivatives in the space\nvariables. In the second half of the paper this extended framework is applied\nto theincompressible Navier-Stokes equations, on a torus T^d of any dimension.\nIn this way a number of results are obtained in the setting of the Sobolev\nspaces H^n(T^d), choosing the approximate solutions in a number of different\nways. With the simplest choices we recover local existence of the exact\nsolution for arbitrary data and external forces, as well as global existence\nfor small data and forces. With the supplementary assumption of exponential\ndecay in time for the forces, the same decay law is derived for the exact\nsolution with small (zero mean) data and forces. The interval of existence for\narbitrary data, the upper bounds on data and forces for global existence, and\nall estimates on the exponential decay of the exact solution are derived in a\nfully quantitative way (i.e., giving the values of all the necessary constants;\nthis makes a difference with most of the previous literature). Nextly, the\nGalerkin approximate solutions are considered and precise, still quantitative\nestimates are derived for their H^n distance from the exact solution; these are\nglobal in time for small data and forces (with exponential time decay of the\nabove distance, if the forces decay similarly).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2007 16:26:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Jul 2008 12:24:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The proposed algorithm can be used for any constellation (QAM or PSK)\nand any labeling method. The decoder is based on matrix-lifting Semi-Definite\nProgramming (SDP). The strength of the proposed method lies in a new relaxation\nalgorithm applied to the method of Mobasher et al. This results in a reduction\nof the number of variables from $(NK+1)^2$ to $(2N+K)^2$, where $N$ is the\nnumber of antennas and $K$ is the number of constellation points in each real\ndimension. Since the computational complexity of solving SDP is a polynomial\nfunction of the number of variables, we have a significant complexity\nreduction.

We present two complementary methods for optimizing the\nimplementation of Transaction Logic. The first method is based on tabling and\nwe modified the proof theory to table calls and answers on states (practically,\nequivalent to dynamic programming). The call-answer table is indexed on the\ncall and a signature of the state in which the call was made. The answer\ncolumns contain the answer unification and a signature of the state after the\ncall was executed. The states are signed efficiently using a technique based on\ntries and counting. The second method is based on incremental evaluation and it\napplies when the data oracle contains derived relations. The deletions and\ninsertions (executed in the transaction oracle) change the state of the\ndatabase. Using the heuristic of inertia (only a part of the state changes in\nresponse to elementary updates), most of the time it is cheaper to compute only\nthe changes in the state than to recompute the entire state from scratch. The\ntwo methods are complementary by the fact that the first method optimizes the\nevaluation when a call is repeated in the same state, and the second method\noptimizes the evaluation of a new state when a call-state pair is not found by\nthe tabling mechanism (i.e. the first method). The proof theory of Transaction\nLogic with the application of tabling and incremental evaluation is sound and\ncomplete with respect to its model theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2007 19:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-09-12"}

We\nshow that these assumptions may not be generally applicable. Instead, we\ncalculate the quasi-static thermal evolution of irradiated disks by directly\nintegrating the global optical depths to determine the optical surface and the\ntotal emitting area-filling factor of surface dust. We show that, in disks with\nmodest mass accretion rates, thermal waves are spontaneously and continually\nexcited in the outer disk, propagate inward through the planet-forming domains,\nand dissipated at small radii where viscous dissipation is dominant. This state\nis quasi-periodic over several thermal timescales and its pattern does not\ndepend on the details of the opacity law. The viscous dissipation resulting\nfrom higher mass accretion stabilizes this instability such that an\napproximately steady state is realized throughout the disk. In passive\nprotostellar disks, especially transitional disks, these waves induce\nsignificant episodic changes in SEDs, on the time scales of years to decades,\nbecause the midplane temperatures can vary by a factor of two between the\nexposed and shadowed regions. The transitory peaks and troughs in the potential\nvorticity distribution may also lead to baroclinic instability and excite\nturbulence in theplanet-forming regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2007 06:10:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The\nsimulation includes an equation of state for a two-component relativistic gas\nthat allows a separate treatment of leptonic and baryonic matter.

Our\nresults show that the bow shock evolves self-similarly at a quasi-constant\nspeed, with slight deceleration by the end of the simulation, in agreement with\nrecent X-ray observations that show the presence of bow shocks in FRI sources.\nThe jet expands until it becomes underpressured with respect to the ambient\nmedium, and then recollimates. Subsequent oscillations around pressure\nequilibrium and generation of standing shocks lead to the mass loading and\ndisruption of the jet flow. We derive an estimate for the minimum age of the\nsource of $t>1. 10^8 \\rm{yrs}$, which may imply continuous activity of 3C 31\nsince the triggering of its activity.

The velocity field of the absorbers show a clear rotation pattern but\nglobally blueshifted ($\\sim$ -115 km/s) with respect to the systemic velocity\nof the galaxy.\n  The emission lines also present a blueward component arising from the ionized\ngas phase of the galactic wind.

The proposed\nmethod is enabling in situ IR measurement among operating cards of a system\ne.g. in a rack, enabling the immediate detection of potential hot spots in the\nsystem. .

In an effort to reduce the computation time,\nwe have developed a new method, deemed power blurring, for calculating\ntemperature distributions using a matrix convolution technique in analogy with\nimage blurring. For steady state analysis, power blurring was able to predict\nhot spot temperatures within 1 degree C with computation times 3 orders of\nmagnitude faster than FEA. For transient analysis the computation times where\nenhanced by a factor of 1000 for a single pulse and around 100 for multiple\nfrequency application, while predicting hot spot temperature within about 1\ndegree C. The main strength of the power blurring technique is that it exploits\nthe dominant heat spreading in the silicon substrate and it uses superposition\nprinciple. With one or two finite element simulations, the temperature point\nspread function for a sophisticated package can be calculated. Additional\nsimulations could be used to improve the accuracy of the point spread function\nin different locations on the chip. In this calculation, we considered the\ndominant heat transfer path through the back of the IC chip and the heat sink.\nHeat transfer from the top of the chip through metallization layers and the\nboard is usually a small fraction of the total heat dissipation and it is\nneglected in this analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2007 13:12:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-09-13"}

The key aspect of this model is the high temperature\nof the absorbing electrons. The heat input derives from nuclei accelerated in\nsemi-relativistic internal shocks, like in ordinary gamma-ray bursts. Coulomb\ncollisions transfer part of that energy to electrons. Inverse Compton cooling\non the X-ray photons leads to electron temperatures around 100 keV. Such a high\nbrightness temperature for the optical-UV emission implies an emitting area\nroughly equal to that of the thermal X-ray component. This suggests a model in\nwhich the radio, optical-UV and thermal X-ray emission are closely related:\nAlthough the optical-UV and thermal X-ray emission are two separate spectral\ncomponents, it is argued that they both come from the photosphere of a\nquasi-spherical, continuous outflow, whose interaction with the circumstellar\nmedium gives rise to the radio emission.

After discussing different mass loss mechanisms and their\nmetallicity dependence, we present the possibility of strong mass loss at very\nlow metallicity. Our models at Z=1e-8 show that stars more massive than about\n60 solar masses may lose a significant fraction of their initial mass in the\nred supergiant phase. This mass loss is due to the surface enrichment in CNO\nelements via rotational and convective mixing. Our 85 solar mass model ends its\nlife as a fast rotating WO type Wolf-Rayet star. Therefore the models predict\nthe existence of type Ic SNe and long and soft GRBs at very low metallicities.\nSuch strong mass loss in the red supergiant phase or the Omega-Gamma limit\ncould prevent the most massive stars from ending as pair-creation supernovae.\n  The very low metallicity models calculated are also very interesting from the\nnucleosynthesis point of view. Indeed, the wind of the massive star models can\nreproduce the CNO abundances of the most metal-poor carbon-rich star known to\ndate, HE1327-2326. Finally, using chemical evolution models, we are able to\nreproduce the evolution of CNO elements as observed in the normal extremely\nmetal poor stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2007 14:14:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

However, very little\nis known about the nature of such interaction, so that models and theories\nmostly rely on aprioristic assumptions. By reconstructing the three-dimensional\nposition of individual birds in airborne flocks of few thousands members, we\nprove that the interaction does not depend on the metric distance, as most\ncurrent models and theories assume, but rather on the topological distance. In\nfact, we discover that each bird interacts on average with a fixed number of\nneighbours (six-seven), rather than with all neighbours within a fixed metric\ndistance. We argue that a topological interaction is indispensable to maintain\nflock's cohesion against the large density changes caused by external\nperturbations, typically predation. We support this hypothesis by numerical\nsimulations, showing that a topological interaction grants significantly higher\ncohesion of the aggregation compared to a standard metric one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2007 14:53:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
