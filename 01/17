The fact\nthat the optical and X-ray lightcurves are often different, with breaks at\ndifferent times, makes contrived any explanation based on the same origin for\nboth the X-ray and optical fluxes. We here assume that the central engine can\nbe active for a long time, producing shells of decreasing bulk Lorentz factors\nGamma. We also assume that the internal dissipation of these late shells\nproduces a continuous and smooth emission (power-law in time), usually dominant\nin X-rays and sometimes in the optical. When Gamma of the late shells is larger\nthan 1/theta_j, where theta_j is the jet opening angle, we see only a portion\nof the emitting surface. Eventually, Gamma becomes smaller than 1/theta_j, and\nthe entire emitting surface is visible. Thus there is a break in the light\ncurve when Gamma=1/theta_j, which we associate to the time at which the plateau\nends. After the steeply decaying phase which follows the early prompt, we see\nthe sum of two emission components: the \"late-prompt\" emission (due to late\ninternal dissipation), and the \"real afterglow\" emission (due to external\nshocks). A variety of different optical and X-ray light curves are then\npossible, explaining why the X-ray and the optical light curves often do not\ntrack each other (but sometimes do), and often they do not have simultaneous\nbreaks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jan 2007 18:06:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Feb 2007 08:34:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Models including this\nprocess give the best agreement with the observations. In the midplane, cosmic\nray heating can desorb weakly bound molecules such as CO and N$_2$.

At lower energies, however, a substantial fraction of the\nsource-subtracted emission arises from diffuse hot gas extending to ~20 kpc\nfrom the galactic center. The observed diffuse X-ray emission from the galaxy\nshows a steep spectrum that can be characterized by an optically-thin thermal\nplasma with temperatures of ~0.6-0.7 keV, varying little with radius. The\ndiffuse emission has a total luminosity of ~3e39 erg/s in the 0.2-2 keV energy\nrange.

These membranes are only one atom thick and still\ndisplay a long-range crystalline order. However, our studies by transmission\nelectron microscopy (TEM) have revealed that suspended graphene sheets are not\nperfectly flat but exhibit intrinsic microscopic roughening such that the\nsurface normal varies by several degrees and out-of-plane deformations reach 1\nnm. The atomically-thin single-crystal membranes offer an ample scope for\nfundamental research and new technologies whereas the observed corrugations in\nthe third dimension may shed light on subtle reasons behind the stability of 2D\ncrystals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jan 2007 19:16:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this paper we will\nrevisit the solution of Juels and Wattenberg and we will provide answers to two\nimportant questions: What type of error-correcting codes should be used and\nwhat happens if biometric templates are not uniformly distributed, i.e. the\nbiometric data come with redundancy. Answering the first question will lead us\nto the search for low-rate large-minimum distance error-correcting codes which\ncome with efficient decoding algorithms up to the designed distance. In order\nto answer the second question we relate the rate required with a quantity\nconnected to the \"entropy\" of the string, trying to estimate a sort of\n\"capacity\", if we want to see a flavor of the converse of Shannon's noisy\ncoding theorem.

It is\nconsidered here that it should be possible to make several observations\nsimultaneously, using a large variety of independently developed analyzers. For\nthis purpose, we introduce the original notion of ``full trace'' to capture the\nidea that a process can be instrumented in such a way that it may broadcast all\ninformation which could ever be requested by any kind of observer. Each\nanalyzer can then find in the full trace the data elements which it needs. This\napproach uses what has been called a \"tracer driver\" which completes the tracer\nand drives it to answer the requests of the analyzers. A tracer driver allows\nto restrict the flow of information and makes this approach tractable. On the\nother side, the potential size of a full trace seems to make the idea of full\ntrace unrealistic. In this work we explore the consequences of this notion in\nterm of potential efficiency, by analyzing the respective workloads between the\n(full) tracer and many different analyzers, all being likely run in true\nparallel environments. To illustrate this study, we use the example of the\nobservation of the resolution of constraints systems (proof-tree, search-tree\nand propagation) using sophisticated visualization tools, as developed in the\nproject OADymPPaC (2001-2004).

This model involves a\nspace and time discretization of the dynamics and depends on only two\nparameters: the fraction of space-time occupied by rotating structures of the\ncarrier flow and the rate at which particles are ejected from them. The latter\ncan be heuristically related to the response time of the particles and hence\nmeasure their inertia. It is shown that such a model reproduces qualitatively\nmost aspects of the spatial distribution of heavy particles transported by\nrealistic flows. In particular the probability density function of the mass $m$\nin a cell displays an power-law behavior at small values and decreases faster\nthan exponentially at large values. The dependence of the exponent of the first\ntail upon the parameters of the dynamics is explicitly derived for the model.\nThe right tail is shown to decrease as $\\exp (-C m \\log m)$.

Magnetic resonance\nimaging at ultra-low fields (ULF MRI) is a new imaging approach that uses SQUID\n(superconducting quantum interference device) sensors to measure the spatially\nencoded precession of pre-polarized nuclear spin populations at\nmicrotesla-range measurement fields. In this work, parallel imaging at\nmicrotesla fields is systematically studied for the first time. A seven-channel\nSQUID system, designed for both ULF MRI and magnetoencephalography (MEG), is\nused to acquire 3D images of a human hand, as well as 2D images of a large\nwater phantom. The imaging is performed at 46 microtesla measurement field with\npre-polarization at 40 mT. It is shown how the use of seven channels increases\nimaging field of view and improves signal-to-noise ratio for the hand images. A\nsimple procedure for approximate correction of concomitant gradient artifacts\nis described. Noise propagation is analyzed experimentally, and the main source\nof correlated noise is identified. Accelerated imaging based on one-dimensional\nundersampling and 1D SENSE (sensitivity encoding) image reconstruction is\nstudied in the case of the 2D phantom.

To this\nend, we generalize the elementary concept of recurrence for a point process in\ntime to recurrent events in space and time. An event is defined to be a\nrecurrence of any previous event if it is closer to it in space than all the\nintervening events. As such, each sequence of recurrences for a given event is\na record breaking process. This definition provides a strictly data driven\ntechnique to search for structure. Defining events to be nodes, and linking\neach event to its recurrences, generates a network of recurrent events.\nSignificant deviations in properties of that network compared to networks\narising from random processes allows one to infer attributes of the causal\ndynamics that generate observable correlations in the patterns. We derive\nanalytically a number of properties for the network of recurrent events\ncomposed by a random process.

We show that any generalized measurement can\nbe decomposed as a sequence of weak measurements with a mathematical limit as a\ncontinuous stochastic process. We give an explicit construction for any\ngeneralized measurement, and prove that the resulting continuous evolution, in\nthe long-time limit, collapses the state of the quantum system to one of the\nfinal states generated by the generalized measurement, being decomposed, with\nthe correct probabilities. A prominent feature of the construction is the\npresence of a feedback mechanism--the instantaneous choice weak measurement at\na given time depends on the outcomes of earlier measurements. For a generalized\nmeasurement with $n$ outcomes, this information is captured by a real\n$n$-vector on an $n$-simplex, which obeys a simple classical stochastic\nevolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jan 2007 04:05:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2007 01:07:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
