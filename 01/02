We study the impact of spin state on ionic configuration, on\nglobal shape, and on optical response. For small clusters, the magic electronic\nshell at 4 spin-up electrons is a dominating feature leading to preferred\nbinding for all clusters having four spin-up electrons (combined with 1 to 4\nspin-down electrons). Such a preference fades away for larger systems where the\nunpolarized state is generally preferred.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jan 2007 12:55:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Since Chen claims otherwise by presenting a\nnew inequality, claimed to be a Bell-type one, which separable states\nsupposedly can violate, there must be a flaw in the argumentation. I will\nexpose this flaw, not merely for clarification of this issue, but perhaps even\nmore importantly since it re-teaches us an old lesson John Bell taught us over\n40 years ago. I will argue that this lesson provides us with a new morale\nespecially relevant to modern research in Bell-type inequalities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jan 2007 13:24:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This has been\ncommonly attributed to frequent velocity-changing collisions, known to narrow\nDoppler-broadened one-photon absorption lines (Dicke narrowing).
