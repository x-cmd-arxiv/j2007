HCN\nenhancement can be caused by many different effects, such as higher gas\ndensities/temperatures, UV/X-ray radiation, and non-collisional excitation. As\nactive galaxies often exhibit intense circumnuclear SB, high angular\nresolution/sensitivity observations are of paramount importance to\ndisentangling the influence of SB from that of nuclear activity on the\nchemistry of the surrounding molecular gas. The tight relation of HCN\nenhancement and nuclear activity may qualify HCN as an ideal tracer of\nmolecular gas close to the AGN, providing complementary and additional\ninformation to that gained via CO. NGC6951 houses nuclear and SB activity,\nmaking it an ideal testbed in which to study the effects of different\nexcitation conditions on the molecular gas. We used the new ABCD configurations\nof the IRAM PdBI to observe HCN(1-0) in NGC6951 at high angular resolution\n(1''). We detect very compact (<50pc) HCN emission in its nucleus, supporting\nprevious hints of nuclear gas structure. Our observations also reveal HCN\nemission in the SB ring and resolve it into several peaks, leading to a higher\ncoincidence between the HCN and CO distributions than previously reported. We\nfind a significantly higher HCN-to-CO intensity ratio (>0.4) in the nucleus\nthan in the SB ring (0.02-0.05). As for NGC1068, this might result from a\nhigher HCN abundance in the centre due to an X-ray dominated gas chemistry, but\na higher gas density/temperature or additional non-collisional excitation of\nHCN cannot be entirely ruled out, based on these observations. The compact HCN\nemission is associated with rotating gas in a circumnuclear disk/torus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jan 2007 22:14:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We prove that the Hartree-Fock (HF) wave\nfunction does not violate Bell's inequality, thus is not entangled while the\nconfiguration interaction (CI) wave function is entangled since it violates\nBell's inequality. Entanglement is related to electron correlation and might be\nused as an alternative measure of the electron correlation in quantum chemistry\ncalculations. As an example we show the calculations of entanglement for the\nH$_2$ molecule and how it is related to electron correlation of the system,\nwhich is the difference between the exact and the HF energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jan 2007 17:57:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2007 20:11:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-25"}

We then apply the second\nquantization functor to the damped harmonic oscillator and interpret the\nquantum dynamics of the position and energy operator as stochastic processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jan 2007 18:55:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This work is a further elaboration of work by Colin, in which a\nDirac sea pilot-wave model is presented for quantum electrodynamics. We extend\nhis work to non-electromagnetic interactions, we discuss a cut-off\nregularization of the pilot-wave model and study how it reproduces the standard\nquantum predictions. The Dirac sea pilot-wave model can be seen as a possible\ncontinuum generalization of a lattice model by Bell.
