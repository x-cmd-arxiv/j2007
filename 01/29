The difference in structure is reflected in the\nmass power spectrum of the molecular clouds, which is steeper for the\nmulti-phase calculations. The increase in molecular gas occurs as the addition\nof a hot phase leads to higher densities in the cold gas.

The\nproperties of the network are studied as a function of the temperature by Monte\nCarlo simulations carried out in the temperature range 300 \\div 800 K. At low\ntemperatures, the resistance fluctuations display long-term correlations\nexpressed by a power-law behavior of the auto-correlation function and by a\nvalue approx 1 of the alpha-exponent of the spectral density. On the contrary,\nat high temperatures the resistance fluctuations exhibit a finite and\nprogressively smaller correlation time associated with a non-exponential decay\nof correlations and with a value of the alpha-exponent smaller than one. This\ntemperature dependence of the alpha coefficient reproduces qualitatively well\nthe experimental findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jan 2007 14:14:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Different oscillation\nmechanisms based on cooperative effects between Min-proteins and on the\nexchange of Min-proteins between the cytoplasm and the cytoplasmic membrane\nhave been proposed. The parameters characterizing the dynamics of the\nMin-proteins in vivo are not known. It has therefore been difficult to compare\nthe models quantitatively with experiments. Here, we present in vivo\nmeasurements of the mobility of MinD and MinE using fluorescence correlation\nspectroscopy. Two distinct time-scales are clearly visible in the correlation\ncurves. While the faster time-scale can be attributed to cytoplasmic diffusion,\nthe slower time-scale could result from diffusion of membrane-bound proteins or\nfrom protein exchange between the cytoplasm and the membrane. We determine the\ndiffusion constant of cytoplasmic MinD to be approximately 16\\mu^{2}/s, while\nfor MinE we find about 10\\mu^{2}/s, independently of the processes responsible\nfor the slower time-scale. Implications of the measured values for the\noscillation mechanism are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jan 2007 14:57:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-17"}
