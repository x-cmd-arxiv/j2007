At such energies, the LPM effect\ndelays in average the first interactions of the photon in the atmosphere and\nhence slows down the whole shower development. They also have a smaller muonic\ncontent than hadronic ones. The response of a surface detector such as that of\nthe Auger Observatory to these specific showers is thus different and has to be\naccounted for in order to enable potential photon candidates reconstruction\ncorrectly. The energy reconstruction in particular has to be adapted to the\nlate development of photon showers. We propose in this article a method for the\nreconstruction of the energy of photon showers with a surface detector. The key\nfeature of this method is to rely explicitly on the development stage of the\nshower. This approach leads to very satisfactory results ($\\simeq 20%$). At\neven higher energies ($5.10^{19}$ eV and above) the probability for the photon\nto convert into a pair of e$^+$e$^-$ in the geomagnetic field becomes non\nnegligible and requires a different function to evaluate the energy with the\nproposed method. We propose several approaches to deal with this issue in the\nscope of the establishment of an upper bound on the photon fraction in UHECR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jan 2007 20:08:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The He\nI absorption shows significant radial velocity variations throughout the cycle,\nwith a rapid change of over 200 km/s near the 2003.5 event. The H I velocity\ncurve is similar to that of the He I absorption, though offset in phase and\nreduced in amplitude. We interpret the complex line profile variations in He I,\nH I and Fe II to be a consequence of the dynamic interaction of the dense wind\nof Eta Car A with the less dense, faster wind plus the radiation field of a hot\ncompanion star, Eta Car B. During most of the orbit, Eta Car B and the He+\nrecombination zone are on the near side of Eta Car A, producing blueshifted He\nI emission. He I absorption is formed in the part of the He+ zone that\nintersects the line-of-sight toward Eta Car. We use the variations seen in He I\nand the other P-Cygni lines to constrain the geometry of the orbit and the\ncharacter of Eta Car B.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jan 2007 21:55:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

In\nboth the cases, the $H^\\pm$ has a large branching ratio in the $W^\\pm \\phi$\nchannel, where $\\phi$ denotes a generic Higgs which is dominantly pseudoscalar\nand hence may be substantially lighter than the LEP-II mass bound. This $\\phi$\ndecays dominantly into a $b \\bar b$ pair.

For staircase polygons with punctures of arbitrary\nsize, a careful numerical analysis yields very accurate estimates for the area\nmoments. Interestingly, we find that the leading correction term for each area\nmoment is proportional to the corresponding area moment with one less puncture.\nWe finally analyse corresponding quantities for punctured self-avoiding\npolygons and find agreement with the conjectured formulas to at least 3-4\nsignificant digits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jan 2007 08:32:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Apr 2008 09:28:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-28"}

Thanks to a classical result by Kostant, we establish a\nsimilar result for the k-th graded component of the space H(g) of G-harmonic\npolynomials. These stabilization properties are equivalent to the existence of\na limit in infinitely many variables for the graded characters associated to\nS(g) and H(g).

Two main steps\nare: 1) an absorption of a single photon by an atom passing through a high-Q\ncavity containing electromagnetic field in a thermal or coherent state, 2) a\nsubsequent measurement of the photon statistics in the new field state arising\nafter the photon absorption. Then comparing the probabilities of finding 0 and\n1 photons in the initial and final states of the field, one can make\nconclusions on the form of the one-count operation. This method can be readily\napplied in the microwave cavity QED with present technology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jan 2007 19:08:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2007 23:17:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2007 09:45:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

As a key establishment primitive, QKD however does not\nprovide a standalone security service in its own: the secret keys established\nby QKD are in general then used by a subsequent cryptographic applications for\nwhich the requirements, the context of use and the security properties can\nvary. It is therefore important, in the perspective of integrating QKD in\nsecurity infrastructures, to analyze how QKD can be combined with other\ncryptographic primitives. The purpose of this survey article, which is mostly\ncentered on European research results, is to contribute to such an analysis. We\nfirst review and compare the properties of the existing key establishment\ntechniques, QKD being one of them. We then study more specifically two generic\nscenarios related to the practical use of QKD in cryptographic infrastructures:\n1) using QKD as a key renewal technique for a symmetric cipher over a\npoint-to-point link; 2) using QKD in a network containing many users with the\nobjective of offering any-to-any key establishment service. We discuss the\nconstraints as well as the potential interest of using QKD in these contexts.\nWe finally give an overview of challenges relative to the development of QKD\ntechnology that also constitute potential avenues for cryptographic research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jan 2007 14:25:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Dec 2014 18:07:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 4 Dec 2014 23:28:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-10"}
