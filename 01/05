The central problem is\nwhy the rotation power manifests itself in both gamma-ray beams and a highly\nrelativistic wind of electron-positron plasmas, which excites surrounding\nnebulae observed in X-ray.

The wind mechanism is the electromagnetic\ninduction which brings about fast azimuthal motion and eventually trans-field\ndrift by radiation drag in close vicinity of the light cylinder and beyond. The\nwind causes loss of particles from the system. This maintains charge deficiency\nin the outer gap and pair creation. The model is thus in a steady state,\nbalancing loss and supply of particles.

When the ratio of the time it takes the cluster to\ncross the density wave to the crossing time of stars in the cluster is much\nsmaller than one, the energy gain of stars can be predicted accurately in the\nimpulsive approximation. When this ratio is much larger than one, the cluster\nis heated adiabatically and the net effect of heating is largely damped. For a\ngiven duration of the perturbation, this ratio is smaller for stars in the\nouter parts of the cluster compared to stars in the inner part. The cluster\nenergy gain due to perturbations of various duration as obtained from our\nN-body simulations is in good agreement with theoretical predictions taking\ninto account the effect of adiabatic damping. Perturbations by the broad\nstellar component of the spiral arms on a cluster are in the adiabatic regime\nand, therefore, hardly contribute to the energy gain and mass loss of the\ncluster. We consider the effect of crossings through the high density shocked\ngas in the spiral arms, which result in a more impulsive compression of the\ncluster.

In strong contrast to this large-scale\nhydrodynamic viewpoint, we demonstrate in this study that the wettability of\nthe impacting body is a key factor in determining the degree of splashing. This\nunexpected result is illustrated in Fig.1: a large cavity is evident for an\nimpacting hydrophobic sphere (1.b), contrasting with the hydrophilic sphere's\nimpact under the very same conditions (1.a).

In this work, we reveal, by\ntheoretical prediction and numerical verification, negative refraction in\nnonlinear oscillatory systems. We demonstrate that unlike what happens in\nlinear optics, negative refraction of nonlinear waves does not depend on the\npresence of the special left-handed material, but depends on suitable physical\ncondition. Namely, this phenomenon can be observed in wide range of oscillatory\nmedia under the Hopf bifurcation condition. The complex Ginzburg-Landau\nequation and a chemical reaction-diffusion model are used to demonstrate the\nfeasibility of this nonlinear negative refraction behavior in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jan 2007 12:27:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The main finding of the present paper is the effect of pinning\nof the resonant levels to the Fermi energy due to the enhanced screening. Our\nresults represent a significant departure from a conventional picture where a\nvariation of external parameters (such as a gate voltage, magnetic field, etc.)\ncauses the successive dot states to sweep past the Fermi level in a linear\nfashion. We instead demonstrate highly nonlinear behavior of the resonant\nlevels in the vicinity of the Fermi energy. The pinning of the resonant levels\nin open quantum dots leads to the broadening of the conduction oscillations in\ncomparison to the one electron picture. The effect of pinning becomes much more\npronounced in the presence of the perpendicular magnetic field. This can be\nattributed to the enhanced screening efficiency because of the increased\nlocalization of the wave function. The strong pinning of the resonant energy\nlevels in the presence of magnetic field can have a profound effect on\ntransport properties of various devices operating in the edge state transport\nregime.

In the deconfinement phase of QCD, a colored single quark state is\nallowed as a finite energy state, which yields to a contribution of wraparound\nquark propagation to temporal meson correlators. We investigate the effects in\nthe free quark case and quenched QCD at finite temperature. The ``scattering''\ncontribution causes a constant mode in meson correlators with zero spatial\nmomentum and degenerate quark masses, which can dominate the correlators in the\nregion of large imaginary times. In the free spectral function, the\ncontribution yields a term proportional to $\\omega\\delta(\\omega)$. Therefore\nthis contribution is related to transport phenomena in the quark gluon plasma.\nIt is possible to distinguish the constant contribution from the other part\nusing several analysis methods proposed in this paper. As a result of the\nanalyses, we find that drastic changes in charmonium correlators for $\\chi_c$\nstates just above the deconfinement transition are due to the constant\ncontribution. The other differences in the $\\chi_c$ states are small.

In our model, two types of replicating\nmolecules, denoted A and B, are present in some initial concentration in the\nchemostat. Molecules A and B are stimulated to replicate by some growth\nfactors, denoted GA and GB, respectively. It is also assumed that A and B can\ncovalently link, and that the conjugated molecule can be stimulated by either\nthe GA or GB growth factors (and can be degraded). We show that, if the\nchemostat is stimulated by both growth factors for a certain time, followed by\na time gap during which the chemostat is not stimulated at all, and if the\nchemostat is then stimulated again by only one of the growth factors, then\nthere will be a transient increase in the number of molecules activated by the\nother growth factor. Therefore, the chemostat bears the imprint of earlier,\nsimultaneous stimulation with both growth factors, which is indicative of\nassociative learning.
