The chemistry of, and infrared (IR) emission from, polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbons (PAHs) in disks around Herbig Ae/Be and T Tauri stars are\ninvestigated. The equilibrium distribution of the PAHs over all accessible\ncharge/hydrogenation states depends on the size and shape of the PAHs and on\nthe physical properties of the star and surrounding disk.\n  Methods. A chemistry model is created to calculate this equilibrium\ndistribution. Destruction of PAHs by ultraviolet (UV) photons, possibly in\nmulti-photon absorption events, is taken into account. The chemistry model is\ncoupled to a radiative transfer code to provide the physical parameters and to\ncombine the PAH emission with the spectral energy distribution (SED) from the\nstar+disk system.\n  Results. Normally hydrogenated PAHs in Herbig Ae/Be disks account for most of\nthe observed PAH emission, with neutral and positively ionized species\ncontributing in roughly equal amounts. Close to the midplane, the PAHs are more\nstrongly hydrogenated and negatively ionized, but these species do not\ncontribute to the overall emission because of the low UV/optical flux deep\ninside the disk. PAHs of 50 carbon atoms are destroyed out to 100 AU in the\ndisk's surface layer, and the resulting spatial extent of the emission does not\nagree well with observations. Rather, PAHs of about 100 carbon atoms or more\nare predicted to cause most of the observed emission. The emission is extended\non a scale similar to that of the size of the disk. Furthermore, the emission\nfrom T Tauri disks is much weaker and concentrated more towards the central\nstar than that from Herbig Ae/Be disks. Positively ionized PAHs are predicted\nto be largely absent in T Tauri disks because of the weaker radiation field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jan 2007 11:33:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

There are two directions of exploration. One\nis to study networks existing in the language system. Various lexical networks\ncan be built based on different relationships between words, being semantic or\nsyntactic. Recent studies have shown that these lexical networks exhibit\nsmall-world and scale-free features. The other direction of exploration is to\nstudy networks of language users (i.e. social networks of people in the\nlinguistic community), and their role in language evolution. Social networks\nalso show small-world and scale-free features, which cannot be captured by\nrandom or regular network models. In the past, computational models of language\nchange and language emergence often assume a population to have a random or\nregular structure, and there has been little discussion how network structures\nmay affect the dynamics. In the second part of the paper, a series of\nsimulation models of diffusion of linguistic innovation are used to illustrate\nthe importance of choosing realistic conditions of population structure for\nmodeling language change. Four types of social networks are compared, which\nexhibit two categories of diffusion dynamics. While the questions about which\ntype of networks are more appropriate for modeling still remains, we give some\npreliminary suggestions for choosing the type of social networks for modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jan 2007 00:45:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It has been assumed that the spike train coming out of a\nfiring neuron encodes all the information produced by it as output. This\ninformation over a period of time can be extracted by a Fourier transform. The\nFourier coefficients arranged in a vector form will uniquely represent the\nneural spike train over a period of time. The information emanating out of all\nthe neurons in a given neural circuit over a period of time will be represented\nby a collection of points in a multidimensional vector space. This cluster of\npoints represents the functional or behavioral form of the neural circuit. It\nhas been proposed that a particular cluster of vectors as the representation of\na new behavior is chosen by the brain interactively with respect to the memory\nstored in that circuit and the synaptic plasticity of the circuit. It has been\nproposed that in this situation a Coulomb force like expression governs the\ndynamics of functioning of the circuit and stability of the system is reached\nat the minimum of all the minima of a potential function derived from the force\nlike expression. The calculations have been done with respect to a pseudometric\ndefined in a multidimensional vector space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jan 2007 20:52:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Jun 2007 17:19:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-16"}

In\ncontrast to the commonly adobted quantum pure two-party model in the literature\nwhere classical communication is normally ignored, we propose an alternative\ninterpretation for the purification of classical communication in two-party\nprotocols by introducing a quantum third party for the classical channel. This\ninterpretation leads to a global three-party model, involving Alice's and Bob's\nmachines and the environment coupled to the macroscopic channel, using the\ndecoherence scheme in quantum measurements. This model could give a more\ngeneral view on the concealing/binding trade-off of quantum bit commitment\nprotocols.\n  Inspired from this three-party interpretation, we extend the no-go theorems\nfor denying some classes of two-party protocols having access to some\nparticular quantum trusted third-parties, known as quantum two-party oracles.\nThe extension implies that a quantum protocol for implementing secure two-party\ncomputations musts have access to a trusted third-party which erases\ninformation and thus makes dissipation of heat to the environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jan 2007 11:23:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 May 2007 17:59:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 25 May 2007 00:46:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 29 May 2007 14:56:03 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 21 Mar 2008 14:12:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-03-21"}
