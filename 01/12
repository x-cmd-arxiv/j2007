Some of them exhibit\nproperties quite different from the planets in our solar system and they have\neluded attempts to explain their formation. One such case is HD 149026 b. It\nwas discovered by Sato et al. (2005) . A transit-determined orbital inclination\nresults in a total mass of 114 earth masses. The unusually small radius can be\nexplained by a condensible element core with an inferred mass of 67 earth\nmasses for the best fitting theoretical model.\n  In the core accretion model, giant planets are assumed to form around a\ngrowing core of condensible materials. With increasing core mass, the amount of\ngravitationally bound envelope mass increases. This continues up to the\nso-called critical core mass -- the largest core allowing a hydrostatic\nenvelope. For larger cores, the lack of static solutions forces a dynamic\nevolution of the protoplanet in the process accreting large amounts of gas or\nejecting the envelope. This would prevent the formation of HD 149026 b.\n  By studying all possible hydrostatic equilibria we could show that HD 149026\nb can remain hydrostatic up to the inferred heavy core. This is possible if it\nis formed in-situ in a relatively low-pressure nebula. This formation process\nis confirmed by fluid-dynamic calculations using the environmental conditions\nas determined by the hydrostatic models.\n  We present a quantitative in-situ formation scenario for the massive core\nplanet HD 149026 b. Furthermore we predict a wide range of possible core masses\nfor close-in planets like HD 149026 b. This is different from migration where\ntypical critical core masses should be expected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jan 2007 16:11:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

In order to identify the young stellar objects\nin our sample, we use the color-color diagram of J - [3.6] vs. Ks - [4.5]. The\nSpitzer images of our sample show that the groups around HAEBEs, spectral types\nearlier than B8, are usually associated with bright infrared nebulosity. Within\nthis, there are normally 10 - 50 young stars distributed close to the HAEBEs\n($<$ 1 pc). Not only are there young stars around the HAEBEs, there are also\nyoung stellar populations throughout the whole cloud, some are distributed and\nsome are clumped. The groups around the HAEBEs are sub-structures of the large\nyoung population within the molecular cloud. The sizes of groups are also\ncomparable with those sub-structures seen in massive clusters. Young stars in\ngroups around HAEBEs have generally larger SED slopes compared to those\noutside, which suggests that the young stars in groups are probably younger\nthan the distributed systems. This might imply that there is usually a higher\nand more continuous star forming rate in groups, that the formation of groups\ninitiates later, or that low mass stars in groups form slower than those\noutside. Finally, there is no obvious trend between the SED slopes and the\ndistance to the HAEBEs for those young stars within the groups.

The scattered light escapes out the cavity, carved by\nmolecular outflows, in the circumstellar envelope. In particular, we observe\nprominent scattered light nebulae associated with the Class 0 sources:\nL1448-mm, L1448 IRS 2, and 3B, as well as a Class I source: IRS 3A. We use a\ngrid of models with probable protostellar properties to generate model spectral\nenergy distributions (SEDs) and images for bands sensitive to this scattered\nlight: J, H, Ks, and \\textit{Spitzer} IRAC bands. By simultaneously fitting\nSEDs and images of the outflow cavities, we are able to model geometric\nparameters, i.e. inclination angle and opening angle, and loosely constrain\nphysical parameters. The opening angle may be an important indicator of the\nevolutionary state of a source. We compare our results for Class 0 sources to\nsimilar studies of Class I sources. There may be a transition phase from Class\n0 to Class I when a source has an opening angle between 20$^o$ to 30$^o$. It is\nimportant to note that while the best fit model image and SED do not fully\ndescribe the sources, the fits generally describe the circumstellar structure\nof Class 0 sources in L1448.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jan 2007 22:22:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

Both methods\nsuffer from degeneracies, however, that are difficult to break. In this paper,\nwe present a new framework that self-consistently unifies gravitational lensing\nand stellar dynamics. This approach breaks some of classical degeneracies that\nhave limited their individual usage, in particular in the study of\nhigh-redshift galaxies. The methodology is based on the premise that, for any\ngiven galaxy potential, the mapping of both the unknown lensed source\nbrightness distribution and the stellar phase-space distribution function on to\nthe photometric and kinematic observables, can be cast as a single set of\ncoupled linear equations. This set of linear equations is solved, maximizing\nthe likelihood penalty function. The evidence penalty function, as derived from\nBayesian statistics, subsequently allows the best potential-model parameters to\nbe found and potential-model families, or other model assumptions (e.g. PSF),\nto be quantitatively ranked. We have implemented a fast algorithm that solves\nfor the maximum-likelihood pixelized lensed source brightness distribution and\nthe two-integral stellar phase-space distribution function f(E, L_z), assuming\naxisymmetric potentials. To make the method practical, we have devised a new\nMonte-Carlo approach to Schwarzschild's orbital superposition method, based on\nthe superposition of two-integral (E and L_z) toroidal components, to find the\nmaximum-likelihood two-integral distribution function in a matter of seconds in\nany axisymmetric potential. The non-linear parameters of the potential are\nsubsequently found through a hybrid MCMC and Simplex optimization of the\nevidence.

The simplest examples possess m states per site (m\\geq2),\nwith nearest-neighbor interactions with U(m) symmetry, under which the sites\ntransform alternately along the chain in the fundamental m and its conjugate\nrepresentation \\bar{m}. We find that these spin chains, even with {\\em\narbitrary} coefficients of these interactions, have a symmetry algebra A_m much\nlarger than U(m), which implies that the energy eigenstates fall into sectors\nthat for open chains (i.e., free boundary conditions) can be labeled by j=0, 1,\n>..., L, for the 2L-site chain, such that the degeneracies of all eigenvalues\nin the jth sector are generically the same and increase rapidly with j. For\nlarge j, these degeneracies are much larger than those that would be expected\nfrom the U(m) symmetry alone. The enlarged symmetry algebra A_m(2L) consists of\noperators that commute in this space of states with the Temperley-Lieb algebra\nthat is generated by the set of nearest-neighbor interaction terms; A_m(2L) is\nnot a Yangian. There are similar results for supersymmetric chains with\ngl(m+n|n) symmetry of nearest-neighbor interactions, and a richer\nrepresentation structure for closed chains (i.e., periodic boundary\nconditions). The symmetries also apply to the loop models that can be obtained\nfrom the spin chains in a spacetime or transfer matrix picture. In the loop\nlanguage, the symmetries arise because the loops cannot cross. We further\ndefine tensor products of representations (for the open chains) by joining\nchains end to end. The fusion rules for decomposing the tensor product of\nrepresentations labeled j_1 and j_2 take the same form as the Clebsch-Gordan\nseries for SU(2). This and other structures turn the symmetry algebra \\cA_m\ninto a ribbon Hopf algebra, and we show that this is ``Morita equivalent'' to\nthe quantum group U_q(sl_2) for m=q+q^{-1}. The open-chain results are extended\nto the cases |m|< 2 for which the algebras are no longer semisimple; these\npossess continuum limits that are critical (conformal) field theories, or\nmassive perturbations thereof. Such models, for open and closed boundary\nconditions, arise in connection with disordered fermions, percolation, and\npolymers (self-avoiding walks), and certain non-linear sigma models, all in two\ndimensions. A product operation is defined in a related way for the\nTemperley-Lieb representations also, and the fusion rules for this are related\nto those for A_m or U_q(sl_2) representations; this is useful for the continuum\nlimits also, as we discuss in a companion paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jan 2007 21:30:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Moreover, we show that the\nhigh order Fourier smoothing method captures about $12 \\sim 15%$ more effective\nFourier modes in each dimension than the 2/3 dealiasing method. For the 3D\nEuler equations, the gain in the effective Fourier codes for the high order\nFourier smoothing method can be as large as 20% over the 2/3 dealiasing method.\nAnother interesting observation is that the error produced by the high order\nFourier smoothing method is highly localized near the region where the solution\nis most singular, while the 2/3 dealiasing method tends to produce oscillations\nin the entire domain. The high order Fourier smoothing method is also found be\nvery stable dynamically. No high frequency instability has been observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jan 2007 03:07:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Continual sensory input of information related\nto the organism causes the organism's brain to learn the physical\ncharacteristics of the organism, in the sense that neural pathways are produced\nthat are reinforced by, and therefore recognize, various features associated\nwith the organism. This results in the formation of a set of associations that\nmay be termed an organismal self-image, which provides a mechanistic basis for\nthe emergence of various behaviors that are associated with self-awareness,\nsuch as self-recognition. In humans, self-awareness includes additional\nbehaviors such as recognition of self-awareness, the concept of I, and various\nexistential and religious questions. This paper shows how associative memory\nand learning, combined with an organismal self-image and, in the case of\nhumans, language, leads to the emergence of these various behaviors. This paper\nalso discusses various tautologies that invariably emerge when discussing\nself-awareness, that ultimately prevent an unambiguous resolution to the\nvarious existential issues that arise. We continue with various speculations on\nmanipulating self-awareness, and discuss how concepts from set and logic may\nprovide a highly useful set of tools in computational neuroscience for\nunderstanding the emergence of higher cognitive functions in complex organisms.\nThe existence of other types of awareness, and the role of mirror neurons in\nthe emergence of self-awareness, are also briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jan 2007 19:23:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Mar 2007 16:30:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 2 Jun 2007 10:54:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-13"}

In this paper we consider this issue in the context\nof `large' cluster states.
