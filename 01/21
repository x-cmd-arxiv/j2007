The\nproduction rate is normalized by adopting a reference value of 0.3 for the\nratio of RP to thermal pressure. The SRE content which obtains, when\nconstrained to reproduce the observed radio brightness profile, yields\nunivocally B(r), if the presence of primary RE were negligible. This procedure\nis applied to four radio halo clusters (Coma, A2163, A2255, A2319). In these\nobjects, the central value B_0 required is consistent with typical, albeit\nrather uncertain, values derived from FR. On the other hand, B(r) typically\nincreases beyond the thermal core, a hardly acceptable condition. This problem\nis alleviated by assuming a mix of SRE and of primary RE, with the latter\nbecoming the dominant component beyond the thermal core. These results suggest\nthat in clusters without a radio halo detected so far a diffuse radio emission\nshould also be observable due to SRE alone, and therefore more centrally\ncondensed. To encourage deeper radio observations of such clusters, some\nexamples were selected that seem rather promising. Efforts in this direction,\nif accompanied by FR measurements, could provide highly significant constraints\non the CR content in clusters, even before the GLAST mission will have\naccomplished the hard task of detecting the GR. A complementary result concerns\nthe excess far UV in the Coma cluster, that some authors have attributed to IC\nemission from SRE. It is shown that this hypothesis can be excluded, because it\nrequires a RP energy content in excess of the thermal one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jan 2007 16:53:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
