We report twelve DLAs (nine\nintervening and three at <5000 km/s from the QSO redshift) with detections of O\nVI absorption. There are no clear O VI non-detections, so the incidence of O VI\nin DLAs is between 34% (12/35) and 100%. Analysis of the line widths together\nwith photoionization modelling suggests that two phases of DLA plasma exist: a\nhot, collisionally ionized phase (seen in broad O VI components), and a warm,\nphotoionized phase (seen just in narrow C IV and Si IV components). We find\ntentative evidence (98% confidence) for correlations between the DLA\nmetallicity (measured in the neutral gas) and high-ion column density, and\nbetween the DLA metallicity and high-ion line width, as would be expected if\nsupernova-driven galactic outflows rather than accretion produced the high\nions. Using conservative ionization corrections, we find lower limits to the\ntotal hydrogen column densities in the hot (O VI-bearing) and warm (C\nIV-bearing) phases in the range log N(Hot H II) >19.5 to >21.1, and log N(Warm\nH II) >19.4 to >20.9. On average, the hot and warm phases thus contain >40% and\n>20% of the baryonic mass of the neutral phase in DLAs, respectively. If the\ntemperature in the O VI phase is ~10^6 K and so f(O VI)=O VI/O<<0.2 the plasma\ncan make a significant contribution to the metal budget at high redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jan 2007 10:14:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

This allowed to search and identify optical variability\nmodes, characteristic timescales and the signal power spectrum over 3 decades\nin time. In the last 10 years the optical flux of PKS 0735+178 exhibited a\nrather achromatic long-term behaviour and a variability mode resembling the\nshot-noise. The brightness level was in an intermediate/low state with a mild\nflaring activity and a superimposition/succession of rapid and slower flares,\nwith no extraordinary/isolated outbursts but, at any rate, characterized by 1\nmajor active phase in 2001. Several mid-term scales (days, weeks) were found,\nthe more common falling into values of about 27-28 days, 50-56 days and 76-79\ndays. The rapid variability in the historical curve appear to be modulated by a\ngeneral, slower and rather oscillating trend, where typical timescales of about\n4.5, 8.5 and 11-13 years can be identified. This spectral and temporal\nanalysis, accompanying our data publication, suggests the occurrence of\ndistinctive variability signatures at days/weeks scales, that can likely be of\ntransitory nature.

PCPD is a stochastic reaction-diffusion model which evolves by the\ncompetition of two binary reactions, $2A \\to 3A$ and $2A \\to 0$. In addition,\neach particle diffuses isotropically, which leads to the bidirectional coupling\nbetween solitary particles and pairs. The coupling from pairs to solitary\nparticles is linear, while the opposite coupling is quadratic. The spreading\ndomain formed from localized activities in vacuum consists of two regions, the\ncoupled region of size $R_p$ where pairs and solitary particles coexist and the\nuncoupled region of size $R_U$ where only solitary particles exist\nrespectively. As the size of the whole domain $R$ is given as $R=R_p + R_U$,\n$R_p$ and $R_U$ are the basic length scales of PCPD. At criticality, $R_p$ and\n$R_U$ scale as $R_p \\sim t^{1/Z_p}$ and $R_U \\sim t^{1/Z_U}$ with $Z_U > Z_p$.\nWe estimate $Z_p =1.61(1)$ and $Z_U =1.768(8)$.

The main result is that every infinite sequence S with\nconstructive Hausdorff dimension dim_H(S) and constructive packing dimension\ndim_P(S) is Turing equivalent to a sequence R with dim_H(R) <= (dim_H(S) /\ndim_P(S)) - epsilon, for arbitrary epsilon > 0. Furthermore, if dim_P(S) > 0,\nthen dim_P(R) >= 1 - epsilon. The reduction thus serves as a *randomness\nextractor* that increases the algorithmic randomness of S, as measured by\nconstructive dimension.\n  A number of applications of this result shed new light on the constructive\ndimensions of Turing degrees. A lower bound of dim_H(S) / dim_P(S) is shown to\nhold for the Turing degree of any sequence S. A new proof is given of a\npreviously-known zero-one law for the constructive packing dimension of Turing\ndegrees. It is also shown that, for any regular sequence S (that is, dim_H(S) =\ndim_P(S)) such that dim_H(S) > 0, the Turing degree of S has constructive\nHausdorff and packing dimension equal to 1.\n  Finally, it is shown that no single Turing reduction can be a universal\nconstructive Hausdorff dimension extractor, and that bounded Turing reductions\ncannot extract constructive Hausdorff dimension.

In order to show the\nuniversality of the role of environment on bound entanglement, both bosonic and\nspin environments are considered. We found that the bound entanglement displays\ncollapses and revivals, and it can be stable against small temperature and time\nchange. The thermal fluctuation effects on bound entanglement are also\nconsidered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jan 2007 02:09:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In this paper we\nargue that \"free will\" can be defined in different ways. The definition usually\nemployed is clearly invalid in strictly deterministic theories. A different,\nmore precise formulation is proposed here, defining a condition that may well\nbe a more suitable one to impose on theoretical constructions and models. Our\naxiom, to be referred to as the `unconstrained initial state' condition, has\nconsequences similar to \"free will\", but does not clash with determinism, and\nappears to lead to different conclusions concerning causality and locality in\nquantum mechanics. Models proposed earlier by this author fall in this\ncategory. Imposing our `unconstrained initial state' condition on a\ndeterministic theory underlying Quantum Mechanics, appears to lead to a\nrestricted free-will condition in the quantum system: an observer has the free\nwill to modify the setting of a measuring device, but has no control over the\nphase of its wave function. The dismissal of the usual \"free will\" concept does\nnot have any consequences for our views and interpretations of human activities\nin daily life, and the way our minds function, but it requires a more careful\ndiscussion on what, in practice, free will actually amounts to.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jan 2007 14:09:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
