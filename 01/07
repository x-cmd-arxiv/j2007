After demonstrating that the chemical features of Omega Cen can\nnot be reproduced in the framework of the closed-box self-enrichment scenario,\nwe discuss a model in which this cluster is the remnant of a dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxy evolved in isolation and then swallowed by the Milky Way. Both infall of\nprimordial matter and metal-enriched gas outflows have to be considered in\norder to reproduce the stellar metallicity distribution function, the\nage-metallicity relation and several abundance ratios. Yet, as long as an\nordinary stellar mass function and standard stellar yields are assumed, we fail\nby far to get the enormous helium enhancement required to explain the blue main\nsequence (and, perhaps, the extreme horizontal branch) stellar data. Rotating\nmodels of massive stars producing stellar winds with large helium excesses at\nlow metallicities have been put forward as promising candidates to solve the\n`helium enigma' of Omega Cen (Maeder & Meynet, 2006, A&A, 448, L37). However,\nwe show that for any reasonable choice of the initial mass function the\nhelium-to-metal enrichment of the integrated stellar population is unavoidably\nmuch lower than 70 and conclude that the issue of the helium enhancement in\nOmega Cen still waits for a satisfactory explanation.

The magnetic field randomly switches between two symmetric solutions B\nand -B. We observe a hierarchy of time scales similar to the Earth's magnetic\nfield: the duration of the steady phases is widely distributed, but is always\nmuch longer than the time needed to switch polarity. In addition to reversals\nwe report excursions. Both coincide with minima of the mechanical power driving\nthe flow. Small changes in the flow driving parameters also reveal a large\nvariety of dynamo regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jan 2007 16:32:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
