We compare theoretical models for error estimation with\nmontecarlo simulations where both the galaxy and the CMB maps vary around a\nfiducial auto-correlation and cross-correlation model which agrees well with\nthe current concordance LCDM cosmology.

We show that purely\nanalytic approaches yield accurate errors even in surveys that cover only 10%\nof the sky and that parameter constraints strongly depend on the fiducial model\nemployed. Alternatively, we discuss the advantages and limitations of error\nestimators that can be directly applied to data. In particular, we show that\nerrors and covariances from the Jack-Knife method agree well with the\ntheoretical approaches and simulations. We also introduce a novel method in\nreal space that is computationally efficient and can be applied to real data\nand realistic survey geometries.

We find ...there is a fast (33 -- 65 km/s) low ionization zone,\nsurrounding a slower (<~ 33 km/s) high ionization zone and, at the transition\nvelocity (33 km/s), vibrationally excited H_2 is intermixed with a\npredominately neutral atomic medium... Far-UV continuum fluorescence of H_2 is\nnot detected, but Lyman alpha (Lya) fluorescence is present. The diffuse\nnebular medium is inhospitable to molecules and dust. Maintaining the modest\nequilibrium abundance of H_2 (N(H_2)/N(HI) << 1) in the diffuse nebular medium\nrequires a source of H_2, mostly likely the clumpy nebular medium. The stellar\nSED shows no signs of reddening (E(B-V) < 0.01), but paradoxically measurements\nof Ha/Hb ... indicate E(B-V) ~ 0.1. ...the apparent enhancement of Ha/Hb in the\nabsence of dust may result from a two step process of H_2 ionization by Lyman\ncontinuum (Lyc) photons followed by dissociative recombination (H_2 + gamma ->\nH_2^+ + e -> H(1s) + H (nl)), which ultimately produces fluorescence of Ha and\nLya. In the optically thin limit at the inferred radius of the velocity\ntransition we find dissociation of H_2 by stellar Lyc photons is an order of\nmagnitude more efficient than spontaneous dissociation by far-UV photons.

If, as seems likely, submm-selected\ngalaxies are proto-ellipticals, one of the biggest unanswered questions is\nwhether a significant fraction form at very high redshift - perhaps by the\ncollapse of single gas clouds - or whether the entire population forms over a\nrange of redshifts, primarily via merging. The latter scenario is favoured\nstrongly by existing data for the majority of bright submm galaxies - mergers\nare common; typical spectroscopic redshifts are in the range 1 to 3. However,\nour reliance on radio imaging to pinpoint submm galaxies leaves open the\npossibility of a significant population of very distant, massive starbursts. To\nrule out such a scenario requires a completely unbiased redshift distribution\nfor submm-selected galaxies and this is unlikely to be forthcoming using\nconventional optical/infrared spectroscopic techniques. Here, I summarise\nrecent attempts to close that door, or pass through to an early Universe\ninhabited by a significant population of collosal, dust-obscured starbursts. I\nconclude that the door is only barely ajar; however, the idea of galaxies\nforming, near instantaneously, on a collosal scale is not dead: I show an SMG\nimaged by MERLIN+VLA for >1Ms - the deepest high-resolution radio image so far\nobtained. The data reveal a galaxy-wide starburst covering >=10kpc. Thus\ninterpreting SMGs in terms of compact ULIRG-like events may not always be\nappropriate, as one might expect when considering the Eddington limit for\n>~1000M(sun)/yr starbursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jan 2007 12:22:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We then consider how this `azimuthal\nmagnetorotational instability' (AMRI) is modified if the magnetic field is not\ncurrent-free, but also has an associated electric current throughout the fluid.\nThis gives rise to current-driven Tayler instabilities (TI) that exist even\nwithout any differential rotation at all. The interaction of the AMRI and the\nTI is then considered when both electric currents and differential rotation are\npresent simultaneously. The magnetic Prandtl number Pm turns out to be crucial\nin this case. Large Pm have a destabilizing influence, and lead to a smooth\ntransition between the AMRI and the TI. In contrast, small Pm have a\nstabilizing influence, with a broad stable zone separating the AMRI and the TI.\nIn this region the differential rotation is acting to stabilize the Tayler\ninstabilities, with possible astrophysical applications (Ap stars). The growth\nrates of both the AMRI and the TI are largely independent of Pm, with the TI\nacting on the timescale of a single rotation period, and the AMRI slightly\nslower, but still on the basic rotational timescale.

Even almost 30 years after it was first mentioned, it is still quite\npoorly understood. We discuss how tensionless strings give rise to exact\nsolutions to supergravity and solve closed tensionless string theory in the ten\ndimensional maximally supersymmetric plane wave background, a contraction of\nAdS(5)xS(5) where tensionless strings are of great interest due to their\nproposed relation to higher spin gauge theory via the AdS/CFT correspondence.\n  For a sigma model, the amount of supersymmetry on its worldsheet restricts\nthe geometry of the target space. For N=(2,2) supersymmetry, for example, the\ntarget space has to be bi-hermitian. Recently, with generalized complex\ngeometry, a new mathematical framework was developed that is especially suited\nto discuss the target space geometry of sigma models in a Hamiltonian\nformulation. Bi-hermitian geometry is so-called generalized Kaehler geometry\nbut the relation is involved. We discuss various amounts of supersymmetry in\nphase space and show that this relation can be established by considering the\nequivalence between the Hamilton and Lagrange formulation of the sigma model.\nIn the study of generalized supersymmetric sigma models, we find objects that\nfavor a geometrical interpretation beyond generalized complex geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jan 2007 09:49:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

Technical report ABRG 3, November, 2003","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"q-bio.NC","license":null,"abstract":"  The extant versions of many basal ganglia models use a `gating' model of\ndopamine function which enhances input to D1 receptor units and attenuates\ninput to D2 receptor units. There is evidence that this model is unsatisfactory\nbecause (a) there are not sufficient dopaminergic synapses to gate all input\nand (b) dopamine's main effect is likely to be on the ion-channels contributing\nto the neuron's membrane potential. Thus, an alternative output function-based\nmodel of dopamine's effect is proposed which accounts for the dopamine-mediated\nchanges in ion-channel based currents. Simulation results show that the\nselection and switching properties of the intrinsic and extended models are\nretained with the new models. The parameter regimes under which this occurs\nleads us to predict that an L-type Ca2+ current is likely to be the major\ndeterminant of striatal neuron output if the basal ganglia is indeed an action\nselection mechanism. In addition, the results provide evidence that increasing\ndopamine can improve a neuron's signal-to-noise ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jan 2007 16:50:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In the usual\nconstruction, Clifford operations arise as projective normalisers of the first\nand second tensor powers of the Pauli group. We consider replacing the Pauli\ngroup by an arbitrary finite subgroup G of U(d). In particular we seek G such\nthat G tensor G has an entangling normaliser.

For the qubit case d=2\nwe exhaustively treat all finite subgroups of U(2) and find that the only ones\n(up to unitary equivalence and trivial phase extensions) with entangling\nnormalisers are the groups G_n generated by X and the n^th root of Z.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jan 2007 21:44:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
