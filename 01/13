The focus\nof most current research on complex networks is on global network properties. A\ncaveat of this approach is that the relevance of global properties hinges on\nthe premise that networks are homogeneous, whereas most real-world networks\nhave a markedly modular structure. Here, we report that networks with different\nfunctions, including the Internet, metabolic, air transportation, and protein\ninteraction networks, have distinct patterns of connections among nodes with\ndifferent roles, and that, as a consequence, complex networks can be classified\ninto two distinct functional classes based on their link type frequency.\nImportantly, we demonstrate that the above structural features cannot be\ncaptured by means of often studied global properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jan 2007 17:04:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
