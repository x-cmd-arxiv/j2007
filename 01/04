This work more than doubles the sample of X-ray-detected\nMSPs observed with sensitivity to rotational variability; it is also the first\nsurvey of a large group of radio-discovered MSPs for which no previous X-ray\npulsations have been detected and is therefore an unbiased survey of the X-ray\nproperties of radio-discovered MSPs. We find that only 47 Tuc D, O and R show\nsignificant pulsations at the >~ 4-sigma level, but there is statistical\nevidence for rotational variability in five additional MSPs. Furthermore, we\nconstrain the pulsed magnetospheric emission of 7 more MSPs using Monte Carlo\nsimulations. The result is that the majority of the 47 Tuc MSPs are\ncharacterized by low pulsed fractions, <~ 50%. In cases where larger pulsed\nfractions are measured the folded pulse profiles show relatively large duty\ncycles. When considered with previous spectroscopic studies, this suggests that\nthe X-ray emission arises from the neutron star's heated polar caps, and in\nsome cases, from intra-binary shocks, but generally not directly from the\nstar's magnetosphere. We discuss the impact of these results on our\nunderstanding of high energy emission from MSPs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jan 2007 23:57:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

To a considerable extent, the final mass is\ndetermined by the ``fallback'', during the explosion, of matter that initially\nmoves outwards, yet ultimately fails to escape. We consider here the simulated\nexplosion of a large number of massive stars (10 to 100 \\Msun) of Population I\n(solar metallicity) and III (zero metallicity), and find systematic differences\nin the remnant mass distributions.

Automated or semi-automated computerized\nclassification schemes can be very useful in assisting radiologists with a\nsecond opinion about the visual diagnosis of breast lesions, thus leading to a\nreduction in the number of unnecessary biopsies. We present a computer-aided\ndiagnosis (CADi) system for the characterization of massive lesions in\nmammograms, whose aim is to distinguish malignant from benign masses. The CADi\nsystem we realized is based on a three-stage algorithm: a) a segmentation\ntechnique extracts the contours of the massive lesion from the image; b)\nsixteen features based on size and shape of the lesion are computed; c) a\nneural classifier merges the features into an estimated likelihood of\nmalignancy. A dataset of 226 massive lesions (109 malignant and 117 benign) has\nbeen used in this study. The system performances have been evaluated terms of\nthe receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, obtaining A_z =\n0.80+-0.04 as the estimated area under the ROC curve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jan 2007 14:59:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The starting point of a formal concept analysis model is presented.\nThe objects of a formal context are states of the interesting entities, and the\nattributes are the variable properties defining the current state (e.g.\nobserved presence or absence of proteins). Temporal transitions assign a\nrelation to the objects, defined by deterministic or non-deterministic\ntransition rules between sets of pre- and postconditions. This relation can be\ngeneralized to its transitive closure, i.e. states are related if one results\nfrom the other by a transition sequence of arbitrary length. The focus of the\nwork is the adaptation of the attribute exploration algorithm to such a\nrelational context, so that questions concerning temporal dependencies can be\nasked during the exploration process and be answered from the computed stem\nbase.
