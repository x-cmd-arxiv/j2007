In all of the scaling relations generated from the\nproperties we have studied, we observe a generic evolution (in good qualitative\nagreement with previous authors): a rapid transient roughly along the mass\nscaling relations, a subsequent slow drift across the scatter until\nvirialization, followed by a slow evolution along and up the mass scaling\nrelations as cooling recovers in the cluster cores. However, this drift is not\nsufficient to account for the observed scatter in the scaling relations.

The\nX-ray distribution of simulated IMBHs has been compared with that of observed\nsources in the dwarf galaxy Holmberg II, chosen for its richness in gas, its\nsmall mass (compared to spiral galaxies), and the accuracy of the available\nX-ray measurements. Holmberg II also hosts one of the strongest IMBH\ncandidates. From this comparison, we find that the density parameter of disc\n(halo) IMBHs must be <~ 10^-5 Omega_b (<~ 10^-2 Omega_b, where Omega_b is the\ndensity parameter of baryons), for a radiative efficiency 10^-3 and an IMBH\nmass of 10^4 solar masses. These constraints imply that a dwarf galaxy like\nHolmberg II cannot host more than 1 (1000) disc (halo) 10^4 solar mass IMBHs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jan 2007 08:06:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2007 17:13:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Unlike previous work, we allow for multiple fading blocks within each\ntransmission (ARQ round), and we constrain the transmitter to fixed rate codes\nconstructed over complex signal constellations. In particular, we examine the\ngeneral case of average input-power-constrained constellations as well as the\npractically important case of finite discrete constellations. This scenario is\na suitable model for practical wireless communications systems employing\northogonal frequency division multiplexing techniques over a MIMO ARQ channel.\nTwo cases of fading dynamics are considered, namely short-term static fading\nwhere channel fading gains change randomly for each ARQ round, and long-term\nstatic fading where channel fading gains remain constant over all ARQ rounds\npertaining to a given message. As our main result, we prove that for the\nblock-fading MIMO ARQ channel with discrete input signal constellation\nsatisfying a short-term power constraint, the optimal signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) exponent is given by a modified Singleton bound, relating all the system\nparameters. To demonstrate the practical significance of the theoretical\nanalysis, we present numerical results showing that practical\nSingleton-bound-achieving maximum distance separable codes achieve the optimal\nSNR exponent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jan 2007 04:01:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

Two vectors v,w in Z_k^n are qualitatively\nindependent if for all ordered pairs (a,b) in Z_k x Z_k there is a position i\nin the vectors where (a,b) = (v_i,w_i). A covering array is an array with the\nproperty that any pair of rows are qualitatively independent. A covering array\non a graph is an array with a row for each vertex of the graph with the\nproperty that any two rows which correspond to adjacent vertices are\nqualitatively independent. The addition of a graph structure to covering arrays\nmakes it possible to use methods from graph theory to study these designs.

Addition is an\nabelian group operation, whereas the maximum defines an idempotent semigroup\nstructure.

We show that commutative idempotent semigroups are\ncontractible, that systems of tropical polynomials, formed from univariate\nmonomials, define subsemigroups with respect to coordinate-wise tropical\naddition (maximum); and, finally, we prove that the subsemigroups in the\nEuclidean space, which are tropical hypersurfaces or tropical curves in the\nplane or in the three-space, have the above polynomial description.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jan 2007 21:58:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2010 16:29:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-18"}

This pattern is statistically steady, is oriented obliquely to the\nstreamwise direction, and has a very large wavelength relative to the gap. The\nmean flow, averaged in time and in the homogeneous direction, is analysed. The\nflow in the quasi-laminar region is not the linear Couette profile, but results\nfrom a non-trivial balance between advection and diffusion. This force balance\nyields a first approximation to the relationship between the Reynolds number,\nangle, and wavelength of the pattern. Remarkably, the variation of the mean\nflow along the pattern wavevector is found to be almost exactly harmonic: the\nflow can be represented via only three cross-channel profiles as U(x,y,z) =\nU_0(y) + U_c(y) cos(kz) + U_s(y) sin(kz). A model is formulated which relates\nthe cross-channel profiles of the mean flow and of the Reynolds stress. Regimes\ncomputed for a full range of angle and Reynolds number in a tilted rectangular\nperiodic computational domain are presented. Observations of regular\nturbulent-laminar patterns in other shear flows -- Taylor-Couette,\nrotor-stator, and plane Poiseuille -- are compared.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jan 2007 00:18:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-25"}

It is shown that if, as in the Penna model,\ngenetic information is represented by the fraction of defective genes in the\npopulation, the population numbers for each specific individual's age are\nrepresented by exactly the same functions of age in both models. This gives us\na new possibility to consider multi-species evolution without using detailed\nmicroscopic Penna model.\n  We discuss a particular case of the predator-prey system representing an\necosystem consisting of a limited amount of energy resources consumed by the\nage-structured species living in this ecosystem. Then, the increase in number\nof the individuals in the population under consideration depends on the\navailable energy resources, the shape of the distribution function of defective\ngenes in the population and the fertility age. We show that these parameters\ndetermine the trend toward equilibrium of the whole ecosystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jan 2007 15:54:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Jan 2007 08:18:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
