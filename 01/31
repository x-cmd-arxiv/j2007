It has recently been shown that in a\nmultifrequency observation, consisting of 2700 pulses, all driftmodes were\nvisible at low frequencies, while at 4.85 GHz only mode-A drift or non-drifting\nemission was detected. This suggests that modes A and B are emitted in\nsub-beams, rotating at a fixed distance from the magnetic axis, with the mode-B\nsub-beams being closer to the magnetic axis than the mode-A sub-beams. Diffuse\nemission between the sub-beams can account for the non-drifting emission.

It is concluded that the sharp increase of the plasma\ntemperature by two orders of magnitude is related to a self-induced opacity\nwith respect to Alfven waves. The maximal frequency for propagation of Alfven\nwaves is determined by the strongly temperature dependent kinematic viscosity.\nIn such a way the temperature jump is due to absorption of high frequency\nAlfven waves in a narrow layer above the solar surface. It is calculated that\nthe power per unit area dissipated in this layer due to damping of Alfven waves\nblows up the plasma and gives birth to the solar wind. A model short\nwave-length (WKB) evaluation takes into account the 1/f^2 frequency dependance\nof the transversal magnetic field and velocity spectral densities. Such\nspectral densities agree with old magnetometric data taken by Voyager 1 and\nrecent theoretical calculations in the framework of Langevin-Burgers MHD.

Methods: We demonstrate\nthis by simulating acoustic oscillations of a self-gravitating isentropic\nmonatomic gas-sphere (cf.

The hard algebra on which this\nexpansion is based, will be given in an independent publication.\n  Due to the composite nature of the particles, the scalar products of\n$N$-coboson states do not reduce to a set of Kronecker symbols, as for\nelementary bosons, but contain subtle exchange terms between two or more\ncobosons. These terms originate from Pauli exclusion between the fermionic\ncomponents of the particles.

The\nsum-rate-distortion region is characterized in terms of generalized directed\ninformation measures highlighting their role in delayed sequential source\ncoding problems. For video sources which are spatially stationary memoryless\nand temporally Gauss-Markov, MSE frame distortions, and a sum-rate constraint,\nour results expose the optimality of idealized differential predictive coding\namong all causal sequential coders, when the encoder uses a positive rate to\ndescribe each frame. Somewhat surprisingly, causal sequential encoding with\none-frame-delayed noncausal sequential decoding can exactly match the\nsum-rate-MSE performance of joint coding for all nontrivial MSE-tuples\nsatisfying certain positive semi-definiteness conditions. Thus, even a single\nframe-delay holds potential for yielding significant performance improvements.\nGeneralizations to higher order Markov sources are also presented and\ndiscussed.

The current paper compares this new data to five\ncurrently available arithmetic parameterizations. Although a precise fit is not\nexpected, two of the parameterizations do not work very well but the other\nthree are able to provide a moderately good, but not precise fit to the\nproton-proton data. The best two of these three parameterizations are scaled to\nthe proton-Carbon data and again provide a moderately good, but not precise\nfit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jan 2007 17:35:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The optimum\nadjustments of individual functional blocks and their joint performance in\ntypical experiments are determined in detail. Prior to testing the complete\nsetup, the performances of the numerical PLL and of the amplitude controller\nwere ascertained to be satisfactory compared to those of the real components.\nAttention is also focused on the issue of apparent dissipation, that is, of\nspurious variations in the driving amplitude caused by the nonlinear\ninteraction occurring between the tip and the surface and by the finite\nresponse times of the various controllers. To do so, an estimate of the minimum\ndissipated energy that is detectable by the instrument upon operating\nconditions is given. This allows us to discuss the relevance of apparent\ndissipation that can be conditionally generated with the simulator in\ncomparison to values reported experimentally. The analysis emphasizes that\napparent dissipation can contribute to the measured dissipation up to 15% of\nthe intrinsic dissipated energy of the cantilever interacting with the surface,\nbut can be made negligible when properly adjusting the controllers, the PLL\ngains and the scan speed.
