Our\ntheoretical analysis is based on the color dipole approach in the target rest\nframe, which has provided a successful phenomenological description of a\nvariety of hadronic reactions. The present application is relevant to the\nregime of short coherence length (SCL), where the spatial extent of the\nfluctuations of the projectile responsible for the Drell-Yan reaction is short\ncompared to the internucleon spacing. In this limit, momentum broadening comes\nfrom initial state interactions and is described as color filtering, i.e.\nabsorption of large-size dipoles leading to diminished transverse separation\nand hence enhanced transverse momentum. The predictions we present are in good\nagreement with the E866 data.

Using single-site entropy and by\nconstructing an entanglement witness, we search for the existence of\nentanglement when the system is at absolute zero, as well as in thermal\nequilibrium. Although the role of the alternating magnetic field b is, in\ngeneral, to suppress entanglement as do B and T, we find that when T=0,\nintroducing b allows the existence of entanglement even when the uniform\nmagnetic field B is arbitrarily large. We find that the region and the amount\nof entanglement in the spin chain can be enhanced by a staggered magnetic\nfield.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jan 2007 16:00:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2007 10:37:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-21"}
