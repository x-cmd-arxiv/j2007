The main\npositive sunspots were dominated by negative helicity fields, while positive\nhelicity patches persisted both inside and around the main positive sunspots.\nBased on a comparison of two days of deduced current helicity density,\npronounced changes were noticed which were associated with the occurrence of an\nX10 flare that peaked at 20:49 UT, 2003 October 29. The average current\nhelicity density (negative) of the main sunspots decreased significantly by\nabout 50. Accordingly, the helicity densities of counter-helical patches\n(positive) were also found to decay by the same proportion or more. In\naddition, two hard X-ray (HXR) `footpoints' were observed by the Reuven Ramaty\nHigh Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI} during the flare in the 50-100\nkeV energy range. The cores of these two HXR footpoints were adjacent to the\npositions of two patches with positive current helicity which disappeared after\nthe flare. This strongly suggested that the X10 flare on 2003 Oct. 29 resulted\nfrom reconnection between magnetic flux tubes having opposite current helicity.\nFinally, the global decrease of current helicity in AR 10486 by ~50% can be\nunderstood as the helicity launched away by the halo coronal mass ejection\n(CME) associated with the X10 flare.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jan 2007 18:33:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Here, we introduce an information theoretic\nframework to the covariant formalism, and use it to interpret the measurement\nprocess. We find that the time ordering of measurements emerges as an entropy\nrelationship in the state of the observers, giving unique probabilities for\nmultiple measurements. This approach suggests a new, fully self-contained\nprobability interpretation for generally covariant quantum physics, which makes\nuse of a quantum mechanical description of the observer, in contrast to\nstandard quantum mechanics which assumes an external, classical observer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Jan 2007 04:26:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 May 2007 18:50:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2008 12:19:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-09"}
