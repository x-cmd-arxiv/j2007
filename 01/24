However,\nbarred galaxies are complex objects where dynamical instabilities play a\nleading role in shaping any spatial distribution. The age distribution of\nstellar populations should thus be analyzed from the two points of view of\nstellar population evolution and dynamical secular evolution. Chemodynamical\nsimulations of single barred galaxies with simple but realistic star formation\nand feedback recipes are used to produce face-on mass-weighted maps of stellar\npopulation ages. Luminosity-weighted maps in V-band are also displayed after\ncalibrating the simulation with mass-to-light ratios provided by a synthesis\npopulation model. It is shown that inside a stellar bar two persistent\ndiametrically opposed regions display a mean age lower than the surrounding\naverage. These two low-age regions are due to the accumulation of young stellar\npopulations trapped on elliptical-like orbits along the bar, near the\nultra-harmonic resonance. Age gradients along the bar major-axis are comparable\nto recent observations. Another low-age region is the outer ring located near\nthe Outer Lindblad Resonance, but the presence and strength of this structure\nis very time-dependent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jan 2007 14:21:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Methods: VHE\ngamma-rays are attenuated by the photons of the EBL via pair production, which\nleaves an imprint in the measured spectra from distant sources. In this paper\nwe present a new method to derive constraints on the EBL. Hereby, we use only\nvery basic assumptions about TeV blazar physics and no pre-defined EBL model,\nbut rather a large number of generic shapes constructed from a grid in EBL\ndensity vs. wavelength. In our study we utilize spectral data from all known\nTeV blazars, making this the most complete study so far. Results: We derive\nlimits on the EBL for three individual TeV blazar spectra (Mkn 501, H1426+428,\n1ES1101-232) and for all spectra combined. Combining the results from\nindividual spectra leads to significantly stronger constraints over a wide\nwavelength range from the optical (~ 1 micron) to the far-infrared (~ 80\nmicrons). The limits are only a factor of 2 to 3 above the absolute lower\nlimits derived from source counts. In the mid-infrared our limits are the\nstrongest constraints derived from TeV blazar spectra so far. A high density of\nthe EBL around 1 micron, reported by direct detection experiments, can be\nexcluded. Conclusions: Our results can be interpreted in two ways: (i) The EBL\nis almost resolved by source counts, leaving only little room for additional\ncomponents by e.g. the first stars or (ii) the assumptions about the underlying\nphysics are not valid, which would require substantial changes in the standard\nemission models of TeV blazars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jan 2007 15:38:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2007 14:11:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2007 13:04:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

However, we find that the hopping integral $t$ plays a crucial role in\nthe short-range spin and charge correlations; i.e., the ferromagnetic spin\ncorrelations between electrons on the neighboring sites is enhanced and\nsimultaneously the spin-triplet pairing correlations is induced, of which the\nconsequences are clearly seen in the calculated spin and charge excitation\nspectra at low energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jan 2007 05:48:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Second, Frank assumes that one can derive a Fokker-Planck equation\nfrom a Chapman-Kolmogorov equation, but no proof was given that a\nChapman-Kolmogorov equation exists for memory-dependent processes. A nonlinear\nMarkov process is claimed on the basis of a nonlinear diffusion pde for a\n1-point probability density. We show that, regardless of which initial value\nproblem one may solve for the 1-point density, the resulting stochastic\nprocess, defined necessarily by the transition probabilities, is either an\nordinary linearly generated Markovian one, or else is a linearly generated\nnonMarkovian process with memory. We provide explicit examples of diffusion\ncoefficients that reflect both the Markovian and the memory-dependent cases. So\nthere is neither a nonlinear Markov process nor nonlinear Fokker-Planck\nequation for a transition density. The confusion rampant in the literature\narises in part from labeling a nonlinear diffusion equation for a 1-point\nprobability density as nonlinear Fokker-Planck, whereas neither a 1-point\ndensity nor an equation of motion for a 1-point density defines a stochastic\nprocess, and Borland misidentified a translation invariant 1-point density\nderived from a nonlinear diffusion equation as a conditional probability\ndensity.

The impact of multiple\nusers, multiple relays and multiple antennas on the key performance measures of\nthe high and low SNR regimes is investigated in order to shed new light on the\npossible reduction in power and bandwidth requirements through the usage of\nsuch practical relay cooperation techniques. Our results indicate that\npoint-to-point coded multi-user networks supported by distributed relay\nbeamforming techniques yield enhanced energy efficiency and spectral\nefficiency, and with appropriate signaling and sufficient antenna degrees of\nfreedom, can achieve asymptotically optimal power-bandwidth tradeoff with the\nbest possible (i.e., as in the cutset bound) energy scaling of $K^{-1}$ and the\nbest possible spectral efficiency slope at any SNR for large number of relay\nterminals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jan 2007 10:02:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Jan 2007 21:13:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 2 Feb 2007 18:42:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

Density functional theory structures and energies\nclarify these differences. Using relaxed surface energies, a Wulff construction\nyields a prism crystal shape exposing long (100) sides and much smaller (001)\nfaces. This is consistent with the BeO prisms observed when beryllium metal is\noxidized. A water oxygen atom binds to a single surface beryllium ion in the\npreferred adsorption geometry on either surface. The water oxygen/beryllium\nbonding is stronger on the surface with greater beryllium atom exposure, namely\nthe less-stable (001) surface. Water/beryllium coordination facilitates water\ndissociation. On the (001) surface, the dissociation products are a hydroxide\nbridging two beryllium ions and a metal coordinated hydride with some surface\ncharge depletion. On the (100) surface, water dissociates into a hydroxide\nligating a Be atom and a proton coordinated to a surface oxygen but the lowest\nenergy water state on the (100) surface is the undissociated metal-coordinated\nwater.

The model introduced in this theory has existence\nbefore time zero so that it is not necessary to interpret it as of big-bang\norigin. The location of the Cosmic Microwave Background, within the theoretical\nstructure gives a closing of the fundamentals of the model in terms of the\ndefinitions of Temperature, Entropy and other Thermodynamic aspects. Thus\nopening up a research tool in cosmology in exact agreement with experiment that\ncan compete with the so-called Standard Big Bang Model as a\nmathematical-physical description of our universe based rigorously on\nEinstein's general relativity.

An assessment of the\nrole of gene duplication based on protein domain architecture shows that (i)\ntranscriptional autoregulators have mostly arisen through duplication, while\n(ii) the expected feedback loops stemming from their initial cross-regulation\nare strongly selected against. This requires a divergent coevolution of the\ntranscription factor DNA-binding sites and their respective DNA cis-regulatory\nregions. Moreover, we find that the network tends to grow by expansion of the\nexisting hierarchical layers of computation, rather than by addition of new\nlayers. We also argue that rewiring of regulatory links due to\nmutation/selection of novel transcription factor/DNA binding interactions\nappears not to significantly affect the network global hierarchy, and that\nhorizontally transferred genes are mainly added at the bottom, as new target\nnodes.

If\nthis unitary evolution operator has an associated group of symmetries, then for\ncertain initial states the walk will be confined to a subspace of the original\nHilbert space. Symmetries of the original graph, given by its automorphism\ngroup, can be inherited by the evolution operator. We show that a quantum walk\nconfined to the subspace corresponding to this symmetry group can be seen as a\ndifferent quantum walk on a smaller quotient graph. We give an explicit\nconstruction of the quotient graph for any subgroup of the automorphism group\nand illustrate it with examples. The automorphisms of the quotient graph which\nare inherited from the original graph are the original automorphism group\nmodulo the subgroup used to construct it. We then analyze the behavior of\nhitting times on quotient graphs. Hitting time is the average time it takes a\nwalk to reach a given final vertex from a given initial vertex. It has been\nshown in earlier work [Phys. Rev. A {\\bf 74}, 042334 (2006)] that the hitting\ntime can be infinite. We give a condition which determines whether the quotient\ngraph has infinite hitting times given that they exist in the original graph.\nWe apply this condition for the examples discussed and determine which quotient\ngraphs have infinite hitting times. All known examples of quantum walks with\nfast hitting times correspond to systems with quotient graphs much smaller than\nthe original graph; we conjecture that the existence of a small quotient graph\nwith finite hitting times is necessary for a walk to exhibit a quantum\nspeed-up.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jan 2007 21:27:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
