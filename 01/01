Boundary conditions (BC's)\nemploying regulatory branes or demanding that the bulk metric be nonsingular\nhave yet to be implemented in full generality. In this paper, we take a\ndifferent route and specify boundary conditions directly on the brane thereby\narriving at a local and closed system of equations (on the brane). We consider\na one-parameter family of boundary conditions involving the anisotropic stress\nof the projection of the bulk Weyl tensor on the brane and derive an exact\nsystem of equations describing scalar cosmological perturbations on a generic\nbraneworld with induced gravity. Depending upon our choice of boundary\nconditions, perturbations on the brane either grow moderately (region of\nstability) or rapidly (instability). In the instability region, the evolution\nof perturbations usually depends upon the scale: small scale perturbations grow\nmuch more rapidly than those on larger scales. This instability is caused by a\npeculiar gravitational interaction between dark radiation and matter on the\nbrane. Generalizing the boundary conditions obtained by Koyama and Maartens, we\nfind for the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati model an instability, which leads to a\ndramatic scale-dependence of the evolution of density perturbations in matter\nand dark radiation. A different set of BC's, however, leads to a more moderate\nand scale-independent growth of perturbations. For the mimicry braneworld,\nwhich expands like LCDM, this class of BC's can lead to an earlier epoch of\nstructure formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jan 2007 11:15:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Jan 2007 09:44:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2007 20:14:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

A simple\nprototype consists of a lateral semiconductor channel with two ferromagnetic\ncontacts, one of which serves as a source of spin-polarized electrons and the\nother as a detector. Based on work in analogous metallic systems, two important\ncriteria have emerged for demonstrating electrical detection of spin transport.\nThe first is the measurement of a non-equilibrium spin population using a\nnon-local ferromagnetic detector through which no charge current flows. The\npotential at the detection electrode should be sensitive to the relative\nmagnetizations of the detector and the source electrodes, a property referred\nto as the spin-valve effect. A second and more rigorous test is the existence\nof a Hanle effect, which is the modulation and suppression of the spin valve\nsignal due to precession and dephasing in a transverse magnetic field. Here we\nreport on the observation of both the spin valve and Hanle effects in lateral\ndevices consisting of epitaxial Fe Schottky tunnel barrier contacts on an\nn-doped GaAs channel. The dependence on transverse magnetic field, temperature,\nand contact separation are in good agreement with a model incorporating spin\ndrift and diffusion. Spin transport is detected for both directions of current\nflow through the source electrode. The sign of the electrical detection signal\nis found to vary with the injection current and is correlated with the spin\npolarization in the GaAs channel determined by optical measurements. These\nresults therefore demonstrate a fully electrical scheme for spin injection,\ntransport, and detection in a lateral semiconductor device.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Dec 2006 22:48:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Drainholes (prototypical examples of `traversable\nwormholes') are topological tunnels in space which gravitationally attract on\ntheir front, entrance sides and repel more strongly on their back, exit sides.\nThe front sides serve both as the gravitating cores of the visible, baryonic\nparticles of primordial matter and as the continuously created, invisible\nparticles of the `dark matter' needed to hold together the large scale\nstructures seen in the universe; the back sides serve as the misnamed `dark\nenergy' driving the current acceleration of the expansion of the universe.\nFormation of cosmic voids, walls, filaments, and nodes is attributed to\nexpulsion of drainhole entrances from regions populated by drainhole exits, and\naccumulation of the entrances on boundaries separating those regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Dec 2006 23:41:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Apr 2007 00:03:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 30 May 2007 11:59:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2010 21:59:49 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2010 22:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sat, 23 Jul 2011 22:22:44 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Sun, 15 Mar 2015 08:03:51 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2016 12:48:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-18"}

These 35 triangulate six distinct\ntopological spaces. As a preliminary result, we show that any 8-vertex\n3-pseudomanifold is equivalent by proper bistellar moves to an 8-vertex\nneighbourly 3-pseudomanifold. This result is the best possible since there\nexists a 9-vertex non-neighbourly 3-pseudomanifold ($B^3_9$ in Example 7 below)\nwhich does not allow any proper bistellar moves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jan 2007 11:35:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Jul 2008 04:59:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-18"}

In this paper, we show that the addition of\nsimilar spatial feedback terms can be used to stabilize such waves. This type\nof feedback is a generalization of the time-delay method of Pyragus (Phys.\nLetts.

We\nconsider two cases in which the feedback contains either one or two spatial\nterms. We focus on how the spatial terms may be chosen to select the direction\nof travel of the plane waves.

We aim to enhance this treatment by making it\nmore appropriate for the biophysics of growth in porous soft tissue,\nspecifically tendon. This involves several modifications to the mathematical\nformulation to represent the reactions, transport and mechanics, and their\ninteractions. We also reformulate the governing differential equations for\nreaction-transport to represent the incompressibility constraint on the fluid\nphase of the tissue. This revision enables a straightforward implementation of\nnumerical stabilisation for the hyperbolic, or advection-dominated, limit. A\nfinite element implementation employing an operator splitting scheme is used to\nsolve the coupled, non-linear partial differential equations that arise from\nthe theory. Motivated by our experimental model, an in vitro scaffold-free\nengineered tendon formed by self-assembly of tendon fibroblasts (Tissue\nEngineering, 10, 2004, 755--761), we solve several numerical examples\ndemonstrating biophysical aspects of tissue growth, and the improved numerical\nperformance of the models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jan 2007 14:21:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Jan 2007 16:37:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 May 2007 19:44:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2007 15:37:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-09"}
