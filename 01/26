The first method, parameter space proximity (PSP), calculates the\ndistance of a single-line galaxy to galaxies of known redshift in (B-R), (R-I),\nR, observed wavelength parameter space. The second method is an artificial\nneural network (ANN). Prior information, such as allowable line widths and\nratios, rules out one or more of the four lines for some galaxies in both\nmethods.

We use 2D numerical simulations to explore formation of\nbound clouds and turbulence generation in the gas of two-component galactic\ndisks. We represent the stars with collisionless particles and follow their\norbits using a PM method, and treat the gas as an isothermal, unmagnetized\nfluid. The two components interact through a combined gravity. Using stellar\nparameters typical of mid-disk conditions, we find that models with gaseous\nToomre parameter Q_g < Q_c ~ 1.4 experience gravitational runaway and\neventually form bound condensations. This Q_c value is nearly the same as\npreviously found for razor-thin, gas-only models, indicating that the\ndestabilizing effect of live stars is offsets the reduced self-gravity of thick\ndisks. This result is also consistent with empirical studies showing that star\nformation is suppressed when Q_g > 1-2. The bound gaseous clouds that form have\nmass 6x10^7 Msun each; these represent superclouds that would subsequently\nfragment into GMCs. Self-gravity and sheared rotation also interact to drive\nturbulence in the gas when Q_g > Q_c. This turbulence is anisotropic, with more\npower in sheared than compressive motions. The gaseous velocity dispersion is ~\n0.6 times the thermal speed when Q_g ~ Q_c. This suggests that gravity is\nimportant in driving ISM turbulence in many spiral galaxies, since the low\nefficiency of star formation naturally leads to a state of marginal\ninstability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jan 2007 05:10:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

Extinction through the cloud has been derived by using the star count\nmethod at B- and I-bands, and color excess method at J, H and Ks bands.\nRadiative transfer calculations have been used to study the effects of\nincreasing absorption cross-section on the far-infrared emission and dust\ntemperature. Dust emissivity, measured by the ratio of far-infrared optical\ndepth to visual extinction, tau(far-IR)/A(V), increases with decreasing dust\ntemperature in L1642. There is about two-fold increase of emissivity over the\ndust temperature range of 19K-14K. Radiative transfer calculations show that in\norder to explain the observed decrease of dust temperature towards the centre\nof L1642 an increase of absorption cross-section of dust at far-IR is\nnecessary.This temperature decrease cannot be explained solely by the\nattenuation of interstellar radiation field. Increased absorption cross-section\nmanifests itself also as an increased emissivity.

In this work we present X-ray spectral and timing\nproperties of HD 110432 from three XMM-Newton observations in addition to new\noptical spectroscopic observations. Its X-ray spectrum, complex and timing\ndependent, is well described in each observation by three thermal plasmas with\ntemperatures ranging between 0.4-0.7, 3-6, and 21-37 keV.

Recurrent flare-like events on time\nscales as short as ~ 10 seconds are superimposed over a slowly ~ 5-10 x 10^3\nseconds varying basal flux, followed by similarly rapid hardness variabilities.\nThere is no evidence for coherent oscillations, and an upper limit of ~ 2.5% is\nderived on the pulsed fraction for short pulsations from 0.005 to 2.5 Hz.

For example, the size of projective geometric computing based on\nbracket algebra can often be restrained to two terms, using final polynomials,\narea method, Cayley expansion, etc. This is the \"binomial\" feature of\nprojective geometric computing in the language of bracket algebra.\n  In this paper we report a stunning discovery in Euclidean geometric\ncomputing: the term preservation phenomenon. Input an expression in the\nlanguage of Null Bracket Algebra (NBA), by the recipe we are to propose in this\npaper, the computing procedure can often be controlled to within the same\nnumber of terms as the input, through to the end. In particular, the\nconclusions of most Euclidean geometric theorems can be expressed by monomials\nin NBA, and the expression size in the proving procedure can often be\ncontrolled to within one term! Euclidean geometric computing can now be\nannounced as having a \"monomial\" feature in the language of NBA.\n  The recipe is composed of three parts: use long geometric product to\nrepresent and compute multiplicatively, use \"BREEFS\" to control the expression\nsize locally, and use Clifford factorization for term reduction and transition\nfrom algebra to geometry.\n  By the time this paper is being written, the recipe has been tested by 70+\nexamples from \\cite{chou}, among which 30+ have monomial proofs.

This transition occurs at a temperature T = 140 MeV and baryon chemical\npotential mu(B) = 410 MeV corresponding to an energy of sqrt(s) = 8.2 GeV.

The measured K+/pi+ ratio exceeds the calculated one just at the incident\nenergy when the freeze-out condition is changing.\n  We speculate that at this point freeze-out might occur in a modified way.

Thus nonclassicality of a state may be manifested through\nthe phase fluctuation parameters. As examples, quantum phase fluctuations in\ndifferent optical processes, such as four wave mixing, six wave mixing and\nsecond harmonic generation have been studied by using Carruthers-Nieto quantum\nphase fluctuation parameters. The operators required for the calculation of\nquantum phase fluctuations are expressed in closed analytical forms (up to\nsecond order in coupling constant). It is also found that the reduction of\nphase fluctuations compared to their initial values are possible in all three\ncases which means nonclassical (antibunched) state exists in all these cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jan 2007 19:21:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-10"}

To describe the normal\nordering in the multi-mode case for each mode a colour is introduced and\ncoloured contractions are considered. A depiction for coloured contractions via\ncoloured linear representations is given. In analogy to the single-mode case\nassociated coloured Stirling numbers are defined as coefficients appearing in\nthe process of normal ordering powers of the number operators.
