It is this force that is responsible for the transfer of angular\nmomentum of a neutron star to an outgoing magneto-dipole wave. If a pulsar is\nsurrounded by plasma, and there is no longitudinal current in its\nmagnetosphere, there is no energy loss (Beskin, Gurevich & Istomin 1993,\nMestel, Panagi & Shibata 1999).

Here, we\nsuggest a potential solution for this conundrum. In general, supersonic infall\nof surrounding gas onto a protoplanet is only possible interior to both of its\nBondi and Roche radii. At a critical mass, a protoplanet's Bondi and Roche\nradii are equal to the disk thickness. Above this mass, the protoplanets' tidal\nperturbation induces the formation of a gap. Although the disk gas may continue\nto diffuse into the gap, the azimuthal flux across the protoplanets' Roche lobe\nis quenched. Using two different schemes, we present the results of numerical\nsimulations and analysis to show that the accretion rate increases rapidly with\nthe ratio of the protoplanet's Roche to Bondi radii or equivalently to the disk\nthickness. In regions with low geometric aspect ratios, gas accretion is\nquenched with relatively low protoplanetary masses. This effect is important\nfor determining the gas-giant planets' mass function, the distribution of their\nmasses within multiple planet systems around solar type stars, and for\nsuppressing the emergence of gas-giants around low mass stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jan 2007 22:15:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

We consider several gas\ndynamical and nonlinear dynamo models that include plausible variations of\nparameters that are poorly known. Models of cosmic ray distribution in the\ngalaxy are introduced to produce synthetic radio polarization maps allowing\ndirect comparison with those observed at 3.5cm and 6.2cm.

In this paper we report on multifrequency monitoring by the WEBT\naimed at following the further evolution of the outburst in detail. In\nparticular, we investigate the expected correlation and time delays between the\noptical and radio emissions in order to derive information on the variability\nmechanisms and jet structure. A comparison among the light curves at different\nfrequencies is performed by means of visual inspection and discrete correlation\nfunction, and the results are interpreted with a simple model taking into\naccount Doppler factor variations of geometric origin. The high-frequency radio\nlight curves show a huge outburst starting during the dimming phase of the\noptical one and lasting more than 1 year. The first phase is characterized by a\nslow flux increase, while in early 2006 a major flare is observed. The\nlower-frequency radio light curves show a progressively delayed and fainter\nevent, which disappears below 8 GHz. We suggest that the radio major peak is\nnot physically connected with the spring 2005 optical one, but it is actually\ncorrelated with a minor optical flare observed in October-November 2005.

As arrays become larger and reach\nseveral hundred channels, the readout electronics have to be divided over\nseveral chassis, but still must maintain precise synchronization of clocks and\ntrigger signals across all channels. This division becomes necessary not only\nbecause of limits given by the instrumentation standards on module size and\nchassis slot numbers, but also because data readout times increase when more\nmodules share the same data bus and because power requirements approach the\nlimits of readily available power supplies. In this paper, we present a method\nfor distributing clocks and triggers between 4 PXI chassis containing DGF\nPixie-16 modules with up to 226 acquisition channels per chassis in a data\nacquisition system intended to instrument the over 600 channels of the SeGA\ndetector array at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory. Our\nsolution is designed to achieve synchronous acquisition of detector waveforms\nfrom all channels with a jitter of less then 1 ns, and can be extended to a\nlarger number of chassis if desired.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jan 2007 19:25:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Multiphoton processes occur and are important for many aspects\nof matter-radiation interactions that include the efficient ionization of atoms\nand molecules, and, more generally, atomic transition mechanisms;\nsystem-environment couplings and dissipative quantum dynamics; laser physics,\noptical parametric processes, and interferometry. A single review cannot\naccount for all aspects of such an enormously vast subject. Here we choose to\nconcentrate our attention on parametric processes in nonlinear media, with\nspecial emphasis on the engineering of nonclassical states of photons and\natoms. We present a detailed analysis of the methods and techniques for the\nproduction of genuinely quantum multiphoton processes in nonlinear media, and\nthe corresponding models of multiphoton effective interactions. We review\nexisting proposals for the classification, engineering, and manipulation of\nnonclassical states, including Fock states, macroscopic superposition states,\nand multiphoton generalized coherent states. We introduce and discuss the\nstructure of canonical multiphoton quantum optics and the associated one- and\ntwo-mode canonical multiphoton squeezed states. This framework provides a\nconsistent multiphoton generalization of two-photon quantum optics and a\nconsistent Hamiltonian description of multiphoton processes associated to\nhigher-order nonlinearities. Finally, we discuss very recent advances that by\ncombining linear and nonlinear optical devices allow to realize multiphoton\nentangled states of the electromnagnetic field, that are relevant for\napplications to efficient quantum computation, quantum teleportation, and\nrelated problems in quantum communication and information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jan 2007 21:46:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

This effect, named after the ancient Greek philosopher Zeno of\nElea (born about 485 B.C), were used in 1977 to analytically predict that an\ninitial quantum state may be preserved in time by merely repeating a large\nnumber of times, in a finite total time, the experiment of checking its state.\nSince then this effect has been experimentally validated and has become an\nestablished physical fact. It has been argued by Simonius that the Zeno effect\nmust be related not only to quantum phenomena but also to many macroscopic and\nclassical effects. Thus, since it operates in both quantum and classical\nregimes it must cause to a more generalized kind of decoherence than the\nrestricted one that ``classicalizes'' a quantum phenomenon. We show that this\ngeneralized decoherence, {\\it obtained as a result of dense measurement}, not\nonly gives rise to new phenomena that are demonstrated through new responses of\nthe densely interacted-upon system but also may physically {\\it establish}\nthem. For that matter we have found and established the analogous {\\it space\nZeno effect} which leads to the necessity of an ensemble of related observers\n(systems) for the remarked physical validation of new phenomena. As will be\nshown in Chapters 3-5 of this work the new phenomena (new responses of the\nsystem) that result from the space Zeno effect may be of an unexpected nature.\nWe use quantum field theory in addition to the more conventional methods of\nanalysis and also corroborate our analytical findings by numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jan 2007 00:26:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
