Moreover we\nconfirm that all the sodium-rich stars are \"mixed\" stars (i.e., giants located\nafter the bump, which have undergone an extra mixing). None of the turn-off\nstars is sodium-rich. As a consequence it is probable that the sodium\nenhancement observed in some mixed giants is the result of a deep mixing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jan 2007 17:44:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Jan 2007 13:16:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Bosons\ngive positive contributions to the DE while fermions yield negative\ncontributions. As usual in field theory, ultraviolet divergences are subtracted\nfrom the physical quantities. The subtractions respect the symmetries of the\ntheory and we normalize the physical quantities to be zero for the Minkowski\nvacuum. The resulting finite contributions to the energy density and the\npressure from the quantum vacuum grow as log a(t) where a(t) is the scale\nfactor, while the particle contributions dilute as 1/a^3(t), as it must be for\nmassive particles.

The axion\nvacuum thus appears as a natural candidate. The neutrino vacuum (especially the\nlightest mass eigenstate) can give negative contributions to the DE.

The two components are treated as\ninterpenetrating fluids in which the gas is treated as a Boussinesq fluid while\nthe dust is treated as pressureless. The only coupling between both fluid\nstates is kinematic drag. The channel gas experiences a temperature gradient in\nthe spanwise direction and it is adverse the constant force of gravity. The\nlatter effects only the gas and not the dust component which is considered to\nfree float in the fluid. The channel is also considered on an f-plane so that\nthe background vorticity gradient can cause any emerging vortex structure to\ndrift like a Rossby wave. A linear theory analysis is explored and a nonlinear\namplitude theory is developed for disturbances of this arrangement. It is found\nthat the presence of the dust can help generate and shape emerging convection\npatterns and dynamics in the gas so long as the state of the gas exceeds a\nsuitably defined Rayleigh number appropriate for describing drag effects. In\nthe linear stage the dust particles collect quickly onto sites in the gas where\nthe vorticity is minimal, i.e. where the disturbance vorticity is anticylonic\nwhich is consistent with previous studies. The nonlinear theory shows that, in\nturn, the local enhancement of dust concentration in the gas effects the vigor\nof the emerging convective roll by modifying the effective local Rayleigh\nnumber of the fluid. It is also found that without the f-plane approximation\nbuilt into the model the dynamics there is an algebraic runaway caused by\nunrestrained growth in the dust concentration. The background vorticity\ngradient forces the convective roll to drift like a Rossby wave and this causes\nthe dust concentration enhancements to not runaway.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jan 2007 06:01:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Jan 2007 06:42:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The comparisons are carried out by constructing a large set of mock\ngalaxy redshift surveys that have the same selection function as the SDSS Data\nRelease Four (DR4). The mock surveys are based on two sets of semi-analytic\ncatalogues presented by Croton et al. and Kang et al. From the mock catalogues,\nwe measure the redshift-space projected two-point correlation function, the\npower spectrum, and the pairwise velocity dispersion (PVD) in Fourier space and\nin configuration space, for galaxies in different luminosity intervals. We then\ncompare these theoretical predictions with the measurements derived from the\nSDSS DR4. On large scales and for galaxies brighter than L*, both sets of mock\ncatalogues agree well with the data.

The disk's profile has the shape of a\nsombrero curved in the direction of acceleration. For this novel state of\nminimum energy, we derive the temperature profile of thin disks. The flaring\ngeometry caused by the sombrero profile increases the disk temperature\nespecially in its outer regions. The jet-induced acceleration disturbs the\nvertical equilibrium of the disk leading to mass loss in the form of a\nsecondary wind emanating from the upper face of the disk. Jet time variability\ncauses the disk to radially expand or contract depending on whether the induced\nacceleration increases or decreases.

The pseudospin symmetry\nof Hubbard models on bipartite lattices turns out to play a crucial role in our\nanalysis, and we develop our formalism primarily for the case of a bipartite\nlattice. We also sketch its development for a general Hubbard model. We develop\na mean-field theory and apply it to the honeycomb lattice. On the insulating\nside of the Mott transition, we find an SU(2) algebraic spin liquid (ASL),\ndescribed by gapless S = 1/2 Dirac fermions (spinons) coupled to a fluctuating\nSU(2) gauge field. We construct a low-energy effective theory describing the\nASL phase, the conducting semimetal phase and the Mott transition between them.\nThis physics can be detected in numerical simulations via the simultaneous\npresence of substantial antiferromagnetic and valence-bond solid correlations.\nOur analysis suggests that both a third-neighbor electron hopping, and/or\npseudospin-breaking terms such as a nearest-neighbor density interaction, may\nhelp to stabilize a spin liquid phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jan 2007 16:41:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2007 17:33:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2007 21:21:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 9 Jun 2007 18:13:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

This paper proposes a\nformalism that exploits these two opportunities to reduce the number of bits\ntransmitted by a sensor node in a cluster, hence enhancing its lifetime. We\nargue that our approach has several inherent advantages in scenarios where the\nsensor nodes are acutely energy and computing-power constrained, but the\nbase-station is not so.

We are\ninterested in maximizing the lifetime of this network. Even though the setting\nof our problem is very simple, it turns out that the solution is far from easy.\nThe complexity arises from several competing system-level opportunities\navailable to reduce the energy consumed in radio transmission. First, sensor\ndata is spatially and temporally correlated. Recent advances in distributed\nsource-coding allow us to take advantage of these correlations to reduce the\nnumber of transmitted bits, with concomitant savings in energy. Second, it is\nalso well-known that channel-coding can be used to reduce transmission energy\nby increasing transmission time. Finally, sensor nodes are cooperative, unlike\nnodes in an ad hoc network that are often modeled as competitive, allowing us\nto take full advantage of the first two opportunities for the purpose of\nmaximizing cluster lifetime. In this paper, we pose the problem of maximizing\nlifetime as a max-min optimization problem subject to the constraint of\nsuccessful data collection and limited energy supply at each node. By\nintroducing the notion of instantaneous decoding, we are able to simplify this\noptimization problem into a joint scheduling and time allocation problem.

Its applicability is illustrated by a study of program\ncomposition when communication is reliable but not necessarily FIFO\\@. In this\nmodel, special care must be taken to ensure that messages do not accidentally\novertake one another in the composed program. We show that barriers do not\nexist in this model. Indeed, no program that sends or receives messages can\nautomatically be composed with arbitrary programs without jeopardizing their\nintended behavior. Safety of composition becomes context-sensitive and new\ntools are needed for ensuring it. A notion of \\emph{sealing} is defined, where\nif a program $P$ is immediately followed by a program $Q$ that seals $P$ then\n$P$ will be communication-closed--it will execute as if it runs in isolation.\nThe investigation of sealing in this model reveals a novel connection between\nLamport causality and safe composition. A characterization of sealable programs\nis given, as well as efficient algorithms for testing if $Q$ seals $P$ and for\nconstructing a seal for a significant class of programs.

The\nsymmetric orbital states are treated by analogy to the ground state. For mixed\nsymmetric states, two approaches are presented.

To reproduce all these features we describe a\nsimple model of mobile colliding agents, whose collisions define the\nconnections between the agents which are the nodes in the underlying network,\nand develop some analytical considerations. The second point addresses the\nparticular feature of clustering and its relationship with global network\nmeasures, namely with the distribution of the size of cycles in the network.\nSince in social bipartite networks it is not possible to measure the clustering\nfrom standard procedures, we propose an alternative clustering coefficient that\ncan be used to extract an improved normalized cycle distribution in any\nnetwork. Finally, the third point addresses dynamical processes occurring on\nnetworks, namely when studying the propagation of information in them. In\nparticular, we focus on the particular features of gossip propagation which\nimpose some restrictions in the propagation rules. To this end we introduce a\nquantity, the spread factor, which measures the average maximal fraction of\nnearest neighbors which get in contact with the gossip, and find the striking\nresult that there is an optimal non-trivial number of friends for which the\nspread factor is minimized, decreasing the danger of being gossiped.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jan 2007 15:45:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-22"}

We find the analytical relations between the atomic\nand lattice parameters under which atoms typically alternate between flying\nthrough the lattice and being trapped in the wells of the optical potential. We\nuse the stochastic map to derive formulas for the probability density functions\n(PDFs) for the flight and trapping events.

We show that there is a good quantitative agreement between\nthe analytical PDFs and those computed with the stochastic map and the basic\nequations of motion for different ranges of the parameters. Typical flight and\ntrapping PDFs are shown to be broad distributions with power law ``heads'' with\nthe slope -1.5 and exponential ``tails''. The lengths of the power law and\nexponential parts of the PDFs depend on the values of the parameters and can be\nvaried continuously.

The\nconjecture states that a multipartite quantum state is separable if and only if\nthe degree matrix of the graph associated with the state is equal to the degree\nmatrix of the partial transpose of this graph. We call this statement to be the\nstrong form of the conjecture. In its weak version, the conjecture requires\nonly the necessity, that is, if the state is separable, the corresponding\ndegree matrices match. We prove the strong form of the conjecture for {\\it\npure} multipartite quantum states, using the modified tensor product of graphs\ndefined in [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. \\textbf{40}, 10251 (2007)], as both\nnecessary and sufficient condition for separability. Based on this proof, we\ngive a polynomial-time algorithm for completely factorizing any pure\nmultipartite quantum state. By polynomial-time algorithm we mean that the\nexecution time of this algorithm increases as a polynomial in $m,$ where $m$ is\nthe number of parts of the quantum system. We give a counter-example to show\nthat the conjecture fails, in general, even in its weak form, for multipartite\nmixed states.
