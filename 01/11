It turns out that viewing the problem of gravitation as a quantum\nmany body problem could be quite useful when addressing some old unsolved\nproblems such as the cosmological constant problem. I have applied this idea in\n1996 to the problem of the largest cold gravitating system, the finite Universe\nitself. The result was the prediction of a small, positive vacuum energy\ndensity, now known, after its experimental discovery in 1998, as `dark energy'.\nThe smallness of this quantity was understood as the finite size effect in the\ncold quantum many body system, and I quote here from \\cite{Ma96}, {\\it `` The\nsmallness of the cosmological constant in natural Planck units is a result of\nan almost perfect thermodynamical limit. This is to say that the smallness of\nthe cosmological constant is an effect due to an enormous number $N$ of\nhypothetical \\textsf{gravitational} \\textsf{atoms}. The present upper bound on\nthe cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ allows us to draw the conclusion about the\nlower bound on a number of \\textsf{gravitational} \\textsf{atoms} in the\nobserved Universe, $N\\sim 10^{122}$. ...''}. The old cosmological constant\nproblem is a man-made problem because the vacuum energy density has nothing to\ndo with the quartic divergences (zero point energies) in the interacting\nrelativistic quantum field theories (i.e. in the Standard Model of elementary\nparticles). The actual value of the vacuum energy density of the vacuum finite\nsize de Sitter Universe is $\\frac{E_{0}}{V}$, where $E_{0}$ is the ground state\nenergy of $N$ \\textsf{gravitational} \\textsf{atoms}, which are spin-zero bosons\nof mass $M\\sim M_{_{Pl}}$, contained in the finite volume $V$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jan 2007 17:33:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-19"}

If this is the case, the conflict between the observed\nprecession and the canonical estimation of the Landau-Ginzburg parameter (which\nsuggests type II behaviour) will be automatically resolved. Such a current\narises in some condensed matter systems and may also appear in QCD dense matter\nas a consequence of quantum anomalies. We calculate the interaction between two\nvortices carrying a current j and find a constraint on the magnitude of j where\na superconductor is always type-I, even when the cannonical Landau-Ginzburg\nparameter indicates type-II behaviour.

We further argue that even\nwhen the induced current is small the vortex Abrikosov lattice will\nnevertheless be destroyed due to the helical instability studied previously in\nmany condensed matter systems.

The spectroscopic analysis reveals an overall variation\nin the Mg II line flux of a factor 1.9, while the corresponding continuum flux\ndensity changed by a factor 4.3.

Consequently, the processes that set the\nproperties of the ICM play a key role in determining how galaxies form. In this\npaper we focus on the shock heating of the ICM during cluster mergers, with the\neventual aim of incorporating this mechanism into semi-analytic models of\ngalaxy formation.\n  We use a suite of hydrodynamic simulations to track the evolution of the ICM\nin idealised two-body mergers. We find the heating of the ICM can be understood\nrelatively simply by considering the evolution of the gas entropy during the\nmergers. We examine the processes that generate the entropy in order to\nunderstand why previous analytic shock heating models failed. We find that: (1)\nThe energy that is thermalised in the collision greatly exceeds the kinetic\nenergy available when the systems first touch. The smaller system penetrates\ndeep into the potential well before it is disrupted. (2) For unequal mass\nmergers, most of the energy is thermalised in the more massive component. The\nheating of the smaller system is minor and its gas sinks to the centre of the\nfinal system. (3) The bulk of the entropy generation occurs in two distinct\nepisodes. The first episode occurs following core collision, when a shock wave\nis generated that propagates outwards from the centre. This causes the combined\nsystem to expand rapidly and overshoot hydrostatic equilibrium. The second\nepisode occurs as this material is shock heated as it re-collapses. This\nrevised model for entropy generation significantly improves our physical\nunderstanding of cosmological gas simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jan 2007 14:53:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

While the low-lying hadron\nspectrum is mostly shaped by the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry, in\nthe high-lying hadrons the role of the quark condensate of the vacuum becomes\nnegligible and the chiral symmetry is effectively restored. This implies that\nthe mass generation mechanisms in the low- and high-lying hadrons are\nessentially different. The fundamental origin of this phenomenon is a\nsuppression of quark quantum loop effects in high-lying hadrons relative to the\nclassical contributions that preserve both chiral and $U(1)_A$ symmetries.\nMicroscopically the chiral symmetry breaking is induced by the dynamical\nLorentz-scalar mass of quarks due to their coupling with the quark condensate\nof the vacuum. This mass is strongly momentum-dependent, however, and vanishes\nin the high-lying hadrons where the typical momentum of valence quarks is\nlarge. This physics is illustrated within the solvable chirally-symmetric and\nconfining model. Effective Lagrangians for the approximate chiral multiplets at\nthe hadron level are constructed which can be used as phenomenological\neffective field theories in the effective chiral restoration regime.

The memory horizon available to the agents\nand the selection criteria they utilize for the prediction algorithm are the\ntwo essential variables identified to represent the heterogeneity of agent\nstrategies. The latter is enriched by including various rewarding schemes\nduring decision making. Though the external input of comfort level is not\nexplicitly coded in the algorithm pool, it contributes to each agent's decision\nprocess. Playing with the essential variables, one can maneuver the overall\noutcome between the comfort level and the endogenously identified limiting\nstate. Furthermore, we model the behavior of the agents through the use of an\nexpression that scores the local attendance states available to the agents. It\nincorporates a single parameter that weighs the relative contributions that\noriginate from the external and internal limiting factors. Solving this\nexpression analytically as well as numerically using the Metropolis Monte-Carlo\ntechnique enables us to attribute statistical-thermodynamical meanings to the\nessential variables identified with the agent-based model, and to gain physical\ninsight to the bounds observed in the behavior of the agents.

As the title implies, the\nmonograph presents a new look at the mechanical movement of liquids and gases,\nexplaining the phenomena associated with the movement of matter in continuous\nmedia. The second part of the same name which is the completion of the\nmonograph is also placed by the editor in this archive. It takes into account\nthe properties of real liquids and gases and gives examples of the practical\napplication of the theory. The created theory of fluid and gas mechanics will\neliminate discrepancies with practice and thus allow the theory to be guided in\npractice throughout the entire range of practical use of liquids and gases.\nThis is the answer to the question of what this work gives. This situation will\nnot only improve any technique dealing with liquids and gases (including\nlong-suffering windmills), but the theory will also be indispensable for\nmeteorologists, oceanologists and many other specialists.
