In the last 20 years, whereas interferometer hardware\nadvances have resulted in improvements of a factor of a few, algorithm and\ncomputer advances have resulted in orders of magnitude improvement in image\nquality. Developing these algorithms has been a fruitful and comparatively\ninexpensive method of improving the performance of existing telescopes, and has\nmade some newer telescopes possible. In this paper, we review recent\ndevelopments in the algorithms used in the imaging part of the reduction\nprocess. What constitutes an `imaging algorithm'? Whereas once there was a\nsteady `forward' progression in the reduction process of editing, calibrating,\ntransforming and, finally, deconvolving, this is no longer true. The\nintroduction of techniques such as self-calibration, and algorithms that go\ndirectly from visibilities to final images, have made the dividing lines less\nclear.

The field of NGC 6441 is very crowded, with\nsevere contamination by foreground (mainly bulge) field stars. Appropriate\nmembership criteria were devised to identify a group of 25 likely cluster\nmembers among the about 130 stars observed. Combined with the UVES data\nobtained with the same observations, high dispersion abundance analyses are now\navailable for a total of 30 stars in NGC 6441, 29 of them having data for both\nO and Na. The spectra were analyzed by a standard line analysis procedure; care\nwas taken to minimize the impact of the differential interstellar reddening\nthroughout the cluster, and to extract reliable information from crowded, and\nmoderately high S/N (30-70), moderately high resolution (R ~ 23,000) spectra.\nNGC 6441 is very metal-rich ([Fe/H]=$-0.34\\pm 0.02\\pm0.04$ dex). There is no\nclear sign of star-to-star scatter in the Fe-peak elements. The alpha-elements\nMg, Si, Ca, and Ti are overabundant by rather large factors, suggesting that\nthe cluster formed from material enriched by massive core collapse SNe. The\nO-Na anticorrelation is well defined, with about 1/4 of the stars being Na-rich\nand O-poor. One of the stars is a Ba-rich and moderately C-rich star. The\ndistribution of [Na/O] ratios among RGB stars in NGC 6441 appears similar to\nthe distribution of colors of stars along the horizontal branch. The fraction\nof Na-poor, O-rich stars found in NGC 6441 agrees well with that of stars on\nthe red horizontal branch of this cluster (in both cases about 80%), with a\nsloping distribution toward lower values of [O/Na] (among RGB stars and bluer\ncolors (among HB stars).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jan 2007 10:25:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-14"}

After\ntrying different forms of the star formation rate (SFR) we find that the\nobserved Swift redshift distribution, with more observed high redshift bursts\nthan expected, is inconsistent with a GRB rate that simply follows current\nmodels for the SFR. We show that this can be explained by GRB evolution beyond\nthe SFR (more high redshift bursts). Alternatively this can also arise if the\nluminosity function evolves and earlier bursts were more luminous or if strong\nselection effects affect the redshift determination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jan 2007 15:07:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 May 2007 10:46:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We confirm the discovery by Folatelli et al.

An\nearly spectrum of SN 2005bf is an almost perfect match to a near-maximum-light\nspectrum of the Type Ib SN 1999ex. Although these two spectra were at very\ndifferent times with respect to maximum light (20 days before maximum for SN\n2005bf and five days after for SN 1999ex), they were for similar times after\nexplosion - about 20 days for SN 2005bf and 24 days for SN 1999ex. The almost\nperfect match clinches the previously suggested identification of H-alpha in SN\n1999ex and supports the proposition that many if not all Type Ib supernovae\neject a small amount of hydrogen. The earliest available spectrum of SN 2005bf\nresembles a near-maximum-light spectrum of the Type Ic SN 1994I. These two\nspectra also were at different times with respect to maximum light (32 days\nbefore maximum for SN 2005bf and four days before for SN 1994I) but at similar\ntimes after explosion - about eight days for SN 2005bf and 10 days for SN\n1994I. The resemblance motivates us to consider a reinterpretation of the\nspectra of Type Ic supernovae, involving coexisting photospheric-velocity and\nhigh-velocity features.
