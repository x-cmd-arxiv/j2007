The superhump signal is\nnoisy and the evidence provided by simple periodograms seems to be weak.\nTherefore and because of the importance for our understanding of superoutbursts\nand superhumps, we determine the statistical significance of the recently\npublished detection of superhumps in the AAVSO light curve of the famous long\n1985 outburst of U Gem. Using Lomb-Scargle periodograms, analysis of variance\n(AoV), and Monte-Carlo methods we analyse the 160 visual magnitudes obtained by\nthe AAVSO during the outburst and relate our analyse to previous superhump\ndetections. The 160 data points of the outburst alone do not contain a\nstatistically significant period. However, using additionally the\ncharacteristics of superhumps detected previously in other SU UMa systems and\nsearching only for signals that are consistent with these, we derive a\n$2\\sigma$ significance for the superhump signal. The alleged appearance of an\nadditional superhump at the end of the outbursts appears to be statistically\ninsignificant. Although of weak statistical significance, the superhump signal\nof the long 1985 outburst of U Gem can be interpreted as further indication for\nthe SU UMa nature of this outburst. This further contradicts the tidal\ninstability model as the explanation for the superhump phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jan 2007 15:34:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Distinctly different results are obtained in\nthe two dipolar squares. In the $\\Phi=0$ square, the ``from-edge-to-interior\nfreezing'' of spins is observed. Its ground state has a multi-domain structure\nwhose domains consist of the two among infinitely (continuously) degenerated\nLuttinger-Tisza (LT) ground-state orders on a bulk square lattice, i.e., the\ntwo antiferromagnetically aligned ferromagnetic chains (af-FMC) orders directed\nin parallel to the two lattice axes. In the $\\Phi=\\pi/4$ square, on the other\nhand, the freezing starts from the interior of the square, and its ground state\nis nearly in a single domain with one of the two af-FMC orders.

The global\nanalytical properties of these solutions in the complex plane define a unique\npreferable radial variable of the one particle problem.\n  These new solutions are fundamental solutions of the quasi-linear Einstein\nequations. We introduce and discuss a novel nonlinear superposition principle\nfor solutions of Einstein equations and discover the basic role of the\nrelativistic analog of the Newton gravitational potential. For the relativistic\npotential we introduce a simple quasi-linear superposition principle as a new\nphysical requirement for the initial conditions for Einstein equations, thus\njustifying the instant gravistatic case for N particle system.\n  This superposition principle allows us to sketch a new theory of the\ngravitational mass defect. In it a specific Mach-like principle for the\nKeplerian mass $m$ is valid, i.e. it depends on the mass distribution in the\nuniverse, in contrast to the bare mass $M$, which remains a true constant.\nSeveral basic examples both of discrete and of continuous mass distributions\nare considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jan 2007 13:11:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A rather general conjecture in string theory known as the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence relates Sasaki-Einstein geometry, in low dimensions, to\nsuperconformal field theory; properties of the latter are therefore reflected\nin the former, and vice versa. Despite this physical motivation, many recent\nresults are of independent geometrical interest, and are described here in\npurely mathematical terms: explicit constructions of infinite families of both\nquasi-regular and irregular Sasaki-Einstein metrics; toric Sasakian geometry;\nan extremal problem that determines the Reeb vector field for, and hence also\nthe volume of, a Sasaki-Einstein manifold; and finally, obstructions to the\nexistence of Sasaki-Einstein metrics. Some of these results also provide new\ninsights into Kahler geometry, and in particular new obstructions to the\nexistence of Kahler-Einstein metrics on Fano orbifolds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jan 2007 19:54:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2007 17:58:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Oct 2008 13:49:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-16"}

Particular attention is devoted to the case of\nmany senders, and it is shown that restrictions on the possible operations on\nthe senders' side may make some quantum state useless for dense-coding. It is\nshown, e.g., that some states are useful for dense coding if the senders can\ncommunicate classically (but not quantumly), yet they cannot be used for dense\ncoding, if classical communication is not allowed. These no-go results are\nactually independent of the particular quantification of the quantum advantage,\nbeing valid for any reasonable choice. It is further shown that the quantum\nadvantage of dense coding satisfies a monogamy relation with the so-called\nentanglement of purification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jan 2007 19:06:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2009 15:48:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
