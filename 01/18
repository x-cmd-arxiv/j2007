In a\ncontinuous observing campaign, LSST will cover the entire available sky every\nthree nights in two photometric bands to a depth of V=25 per visit (two 15\nsecond exposures), with exquisitely accurate astrometry and photometry. Over\nthe proposed survey lifetime of 10 years, each sky location would be observed\nabout 1000 times, with the total exposure time of 8 hours distributed over six\nbroad photometric bandpasses (ugrizY).

In the transition from the RGB to the HB the envelope shrinks\nby two orders of magnitude in size and the core swells, such that any\nnon-negligible rotation on the RGB will result in a strong rotational shear at\nthe core-envelope boundary. For a non-negligible rotation to exist on the RGB\nthe star has to be spun up by a companion spiraling inside its envelope (a\ncommon envelope evolution).

Both of these optical\nfeatures have been conjectured to be related to the radio jet. Here we explore\nthese suggestions. We have obtained Gemini North GMOS integral-field-unit (IFU)\nspectroscopy of the central region around 3C48. We use the unique features of\nthe IFU data to remove unresolved emission at the position of the quasar. The\nresolved emission at the wavelength of the high-velocity component is peaked\n<~0.25\" north of the quasar, at virtually the same position angle as the base\nof the radio jet. These observations appear to confirm that this high-velocity\ngas is connected with the radio jet.

To test the latter,\nthe dynamics of the colloidal electrolyte near this crossing point has been\ncomputed and compared to the universal predictions of the ideal MCT. As in\nother glass-forming liquids, we found good agreement between this mean field\ntheory and the dynamics of this complex system, although it fails just at the\ntransition.

The residual\nsymmetry (\"spin/boost\") can be removed by gauge fixing of spin coefficients in\ntwo steps: First, we break the boost symmetry by requiring that $\\rho$\ncorresponds to a global constant mass parameter that equals the ADM mass (or,\nequivalently in perturbation theory, that $\\rho$ or $\\mu$ equal their values in\nthe no-radiation limits), thus determining the two moduli of the Weyl scalars\n$|\\Psi_0|, |\\Psi_4|$, while leaving their phases as yet undetermined. Second,\nwe break the spin symmetry by requiring that the ratio $\\pi/\\tau$ gives the\nexpected polarization state for the gravitational waves, thus determining the\nphases. Our method of gauge fixing--specifically its second step--is\nappropriate for cases for which the Weyl curvature is purely electric. Applying\nthis method to Misner and Brill--Lindquist data, we explicitly find the Weyl\nscalars $\\Psi_0$ and $\\Psi_4$ perturbatively in the quasi-Kinnersley tetrad.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jan 2007 03:06:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

This difference is substantial because it leads to new gauge\nand diff anomalies, which are necessary to combine background independence with\nlocality.

In this paper the\nharmonic oscillator and free fields are treated within QJT, correcting previous\nflaws. The standard Hilbert space is recovered for the harmonic oscillator, but\nthere are interesting modifications already for the free scalar field, due to\nquantization of the observer's trajectory.

Within this framework, the\ncomputational difficulties related to the existence of large time scale gaps in\nthe protein folding problem are removed and simulating the entire reaction in\natomistic details using existing computers becomes feasible. In addition, this\nformalism provides a natural framework to investigate the relationships between\nthermodynamical and kinetic aspects of the folding. For example, it is possible\nto show that, in order to have a large probability to remain unchanged under\nLangevin diffusion, the native state has to be characterized by a small\nconformational entropy. We discuss how to determine the most probable folding\npathway, to identify configurations representative of the transition state and\nto compute the most probable transition time. We perform an illustrative\napplication of these ideas, studying the conformational evolution of alanine\ndi-peptide, within an all-atom model based on the empiric GROMOS96 force field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jan 2007 10:18:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In recent years, a notion of ''Generalized\nEntanglement'' (GE) has emerged, based on the idea that entanglement may be\ndirectly defined through expectation values of preferred observables -- without\nreference to a preferred subsystem decomposition. Preferred observables capture\nthe physically relevant point of view, as defined by dynamical, operational, or\nfundamental constraints. While reducing to the standard entanglement notion\nwhen preferred observables are restricted to arbitrary local observables acting\non individual subsystems, GE substantially expands subsystem-based entanglement\ntheories, in terms of both conceptual foundations and range of applicability.\nRemarkably, the GE framework allows for non-trivial entanglement to exist\nwithin a single, indecomposable quantum system, demands in general a\ndistinction between quantum separability and absence of entanglement, and\nnaturally extends to situations where existing approaches may not be directly\nuseful -- such as entanglement in arbitrary convex-cones settings and\nentanglement for indistinguishable quantum particles. In this paper, we revisit\nthe main motivations leading to GE, and summarize the accomplishments and\nprospects of the GE program to date, with an eye toward conceptual developments\nand implications. In particular, we explain how the GE approach both shares\nstrong points of contact with abstract operational quantum theories and,\nultimately, calls for an observer-dependent redefinition of concepts like\nlocality, completeness, and reality in quantum theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jan 2007 17:43:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We find that there is initially a phase of very fast generation and\nspread of entanglement. At the end of this phase the entanglement is typically\nmaximal. In previous work we proved that the maximal entanglement is reached to\na fixed arbitrary accuracy within $O(N^3)$ steps, where $N$ is the total number\nof qubits. Here we provide a detailed and more pedagogical proof. We\ndemonstrate that one can use the so-called stabilizer gates to simulate this\nprocess efficiently on a classical computer. Furthermore, we discuss three ways\nof identifying the transition from the phase of rapid spread of entanglement to\nthe stationary phase: (i) the time when saturation of the maximal entanglement\nis achieved, (ii) the cut-off moment, when the entanglement probability\ndistribution is practically stationary, and (iii) the moment block entanglement\nscales exhibits volume scaling. We furthermore investigate the mixed state and\nmultipartite setting. Numerically we find that classical and quantum\ncorrelations appear to behave similarly and that there is a well-behaved\nphase-space flow of entanglement properties towards an equilibrium, We describe\nhow the emergence of typical entanglement can be used to create a much simpler\ntripartite entanglement description. The results form a bridge between certain\nabstract results concerning typical (also known as generic) entanglement\nrelative to an unbiased distribution on pure states and the more physical\npicture of distributions emerging from random local interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jan 2007 17:48:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
