Circumstellar disks\noften form from the gas being accreted by the forming stars, and accretion from\nthese disks may be episodic, driven by gravitational instabilities or by\nprotostellar interactions. Star-forming clouds typically develop filamentary\nstructures, which may, along with the thermal physics, play an important role\nin the origin of stellar masses because of the sensitivity of filament\nfragmentation to temperature variations. Simulations of the formation of star\nclusters show that the most massive stars form by continuing accretion in the\ndense cluster cores, and this again is a runaway process that couples star\nformation and cluster formation.

Inelastic scattering due to impurities can be revealed by\nobserving local features seen in the tunneling current with scanning tunneling\nmicroscope (STM). We consider localized vibrational modes coupled to the\nelectronic structure of a surface. We argue that vibrational modes of\nimpurities produce Fermi momentum $k_F$ oscillations in second derivative of\ncurrent with respect to voltage $\\partial^2I(\\br, V)/\\partial V^2$. These\noscillations are similar to the well known Friedel oscillations of screening\ncharge on the surface. We propose to measure inelastic scattering generated by\nthe presence of the vibrational modes with STM by imaging the\n$\\partial^2I/\\partial V^2$ oscillations on the metal surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jan 2007 23:22:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 May 2007 19:46:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-13"}

Supposing that $G$ is transitive on $X$,\na $G$-split cover is said to be $G$-split-transitive if all complements $\\bG\n\\cong G$ of $\\CT(\\p)$ within $\\tG$ are transitive on $\\tX$; it is said to be\n$G$-split-sectional whenever for each complement $\\bG$ there exists a\n$\\bG$-invariant section of $\\p$; and it is called $G$-split-mixed otherwise.\n  It is shown, when $G$ is an arc-transitive group, split-sectional and\nsplit-mixed 2-covers lead to canonical double covers. For cubic symmetric\ngraphs split 2-cover are necessarily cannonical double covers when $G$ is 1- or\n4-regular. In all other cases, that is, if $G$ is $s$-regular, $s=2,3$ or 5, a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a transitive complement\n$\\bG$ is given, and an infinite family of split-transitive 2-covers based on\nthe alternating groups of the form $A_{12k+10}$ is constructed.\n  Finally, chains of consecutive 2-covers, along which an arc-transitive group\n$G$ has successive lifts, are also considered. It is proved that in such a\nchain, at most two projections can be split. Further, it is shown that, in the\ncontext of cubic symmetric graphs, if exactly two of them are split, then one\nis split-transitive and the other one is either split-sectional or split-mixed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jan 2007 00:14:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The presence of the rich-club phenomenon may be an\nindicator of several interesting high-level network properties, such as\ntolerance to hub failures. Here we investigate the existence of the rich-club\nphenomenon across the hierarchical degrees of a number of real-world networks.\nOur simulations reveal that the phenomenon may appear in some hierarchies but\nnot in others and, moreover, that it may appear and disappear as we move across\nhierarchies. This reveals the interesting possibility of non-monotonic behavior\nof the phenomenon; the possible implications of our findings are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jan 2007 05:44:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We apply a\ndiscrete molecular dynamics (DMD) approach combined with a four-bead protein\nmodel to study oligomer formation of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta). We\naddress the differences between the two most common Abeta alloforms, Abeta40\nand Abeta42, which oligomerize differently in vitro. We study how the presence\nof electrostatic interactions (EIs) between pairs of charged amino acids\naffects Abeta40 and Abeta42 oligomer formation.

The Abeta40\nsize distribution remains unimodal, whereas the Abeta42 distribution is\ntrimodal, as observed experimentally. Abeta42 folded structure is characterized\nby a turn in the C-terminus that is not present in Abeta40. We show that the\nsame C-terminal region is also responsible for the strongest intermolecular\ncontacts in Abeta42 pentamers and larger oligomers. Our results suggest that\nthis C-terminal region plays a key role in the formation of Abeta42 oligomers\nand the relative importance of this region increases in the presence of EIs.\nThese results suggest that inhibitors targeting the C-terminal region of\nAbeta42 oligomers may be able to prevent oligomer formation or structurally\nmodify the assemblies to reduce their toxicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jan 2007 16:49:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
