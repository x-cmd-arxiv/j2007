Folded states of small\nattractive polymers are marginally stable at 300 K, and can be unfolded by\nheating or cooling. Increasing the lengthscale or decreasing the polymer-water\nattractions stabilizes folded states significantly, the former dominated by the\nhydration contribution.

They are used to investigate the problem of how the\ncurvature anisotropy affects the thermodynamic behaviors of an ideal gas. It is\nfound that, when the universe is in the oblate configuration (i.e., d > 0), the\neffect of curvature anisotropy is to increase the number of the fraction in the\nBose-Einstein condensation and to decrease the fermion distribution function at\nlow temperature. When the universe is in the prolate configuration (i.e., d <\n0), the effects of curvature anisotropy on the thermodynamic quantities is\ncontrary to that in the oblate configuration. The density matrix of a two\nparticle system is evaluated and it is used to define the \"statistical\ninterparticle potential\" as an attempt to give a \"statistical interpretation\"\nabout the found thermodynamic behaviors. It is found that when the universe is\nin the oblate (prolate) configuration the curvature anisotropy will enhance\n(reduce) both the \"statistic attraction\" among the bosons and \"statistical\nrepulsion\" among the fermions. It is expected that such a behavior will also be\nshown in the relativistic system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jan 2007 10:07:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Collective degrees of freedom\ngovern essential aspects of nuclear structure, and for several decades the\nstudy of collective modes such as rotations and vibrations has played a vital\nrole in our understanding of complex properties of nuclei. The multipole\nresponse of unstable nuclei and the possible occurrence of new exotic modes of\nexcitation in weakly-bound nuclear systems, present a rapidly growing field of\nresearch, but only few experimental studies of these phenomena have been\nreported so far. Valuable data on the evolution of the low-energy dipole\nresponse in unstable neutron-rich nuclei have been gathered in recent\nexperiments, but the available information is not sufficient to determine the\nnature of observed excitations. Even in stable nuclei various modes of giant\ncollective oscillations had been predicted by theory years before they were\nobserved, and for that reason it is very important to perform detailed\ntheoretical studies of the evolution of collective modes of excitation in\nnuclei far from stability. We therefore discuss the modern theoretical tools\nthat have been developed in recent years for the description of collective\nexcitations in weakly-bound nuclei.

We demonstrate that given a bipartite Gaussian\nstate $\\rho_{12}$ described by a $4\\times 4$ covariance matrix \\textbf{V}, the\nSchur complement of a local covariance submatrix $\\textbf{V}_1$ of it can be\ninterpreted as a new covariance matrix representing a Gaussian operator of\nparty 1 conditioned to local parity measurements on party 2. The connection\nwith a partial parity measurement over a bipartite quantum state and the\ndetermination of the reduced Wigner function is given and an operational\nprocess of parity measurement is developed. Generalization of this procedure to\na $n$-partite Gaussian state is given and it is demonstrated that the $n-1$\nsystem state conditioned to a partial parity projection is given by a\ncovariance matrix such as its $2 \\times 2$ block elements are Schur complements\nof special local matrices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jan 2007 22:44:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Jul 2008 12:23:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Starting from the study of general conditions for classical\nsimulation, we highlight several important differences between two\nnon-equivalent classes of quantum algorithms. We investigate their performance\nunder realistic conditions by quantitatively studying their resilience with\nrespect to static noise.
