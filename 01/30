The derived UVLF at z~5 shows no significant\nchange in the number density of bright (L>=L*_z=3) LBGs from that at z~3, while\nthere is a significant decline in the LF's faint end with increasing lookback\ntime. This result means that the evolution of the number densities is\ndifferential with UV luminosity: the number density of UV luminous objects\nremains almost constant from z~5 to 3 while the number density of fainter\nobjects gradually increases with cosmic time. This trend becomes apparent\nthanks to the small uncertainties in number densities both in the bright and\nfaint parts of LFs at different epochs that are made possible by the deep and\nwide surveys. We discuss the origins of this differential evolution and suggest\nthat our observational findings are consistent with the biased galaxy evolution\nscenario: a galaxy population hosted by massive dark haloes starts active star\nformation preferentially at early cosmic time, while less massive galaxies\nincrease their number density later. We also calculated the UV luminosity\ndensity by integrating the UVLF and at z~5 found it to be 38.8% of that at z~3\nfor the luminosity range L>0.1 L^*_z=3. By combining our results with those\nfrom the literature, we find that the cosmic UV luminosity density marks its\npeak at z=2-3 and then slowly declines toward higher redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jan 2007 23:59:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

This ratio is calibrated for different incident species using\nan AmBe neutron source and Co-60 gamma-ray sources. From our first 31 live days\nof running ZEPLIN-II, the total exposure following the application of fiducial\nand stability cuts was 225 kgxdays. A background population of radon progeny\nevents was observed in this run, arising from radon emission in the gas\npurification getters, due to radon daughter ion decays on the surfaces of the\nwalls of the chamber. An acceptance window, defined by the neutron calibration\ndata, of 50% nuclear recoil acceptance between 5 keVee and 20 keVee, had an\nobserved count of 29 events, with a summed expectation of 28.6+/-4.3 gamma-ray\nand radon progeny induced background events.

A second run is currently underway in which the radon\nprogeny will be eliminated, thereby removing the background population, with a\nprojected sensitivity of 2x10^-7 pb for similar exposures as the first run.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jan 2007 13:49:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Jan 2007 12:05:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Recent experimental advances have\ndemonstrated the on-chip detection of single electron transport through a\nquantum dot (QD). The discreteness of charge in units of e leads to intrinsic\nfluctuations in the electrical current, known as shot noise. To measure these\nsingle-electron fluctuations a nearby coherent conductor, called a quantum\npoint contact (QPC), interacts with the QD and acts as a detector. An important\nproperty of the QPC charge detector is noninvasiveness: the system physically\naffects the detector, not visa-versa. Here we predict that even for ideal\nnoninvasive detectors such as the QPC, when a particular detector result is\nobserved, the system suffers an informational backaction, radically altering\nthe statistics of transport through the QD as compared to the unconditional\nshot noise. We develop a theoretical model to make predictions about the joint\ncurrent probability distributions and conditional transport statistics. The\nexperimental findings reported here demonstrate the reality of informational\nbackaction in nanoscale systems as well as a variety of new effects, such as\nconditional noise enhancement, which are in essentially perfect agreement with\nour model calculations.

Thus, entropy considerations make the well known fact that large\nwavelengths are only marginally absorbed by black holes, a natural consequence\nof thermodynamics. We also study numerically the ingoing radial propagation of\na scalar field wave in a Schwarzschild metric, relaxing the standard assumption\nwhich leads to the eikonal equation, that the wave has zero spatial extent. We\nfind that if these waves have wavelengths larger that the Schwarzschild radius,\nthey are very substantially reflected, fully to numerical accuracy.\nInterestingly, this critical wavelength approximately coincides with the one\nderived from entropy considerations of the EM field, and is consistent with\nwell known limit results of scattering in the Schwarzschild metric. The\npropagation speed is also calculated and seen to differ from the value $c$, for\nwavelengths larger than $R_{s}$, in the vicinity of $R_{s}$. As in all\nclassical wave phenomena, whenever the wavelength is larger or comparable to\nthe physical size of elements in the system, in this case changes in the\nmetric, the zero extent 'particle' description fails, and the wave nature\nbecomes apparent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jan 2007 00:45:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2007 18:50:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 12 Jan 2009 05:19:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-05"}

Conversely, it is shown that if their holomorphs are isomorphic,\nthen the loops are isotopic. It is shown that a loop is a Smarandache loop if\nand only if its holomorph is a Smarandache loop. This statement is also shown\nto be true for some weak Smarandache loops(inverse property, weak inverse\nproperty) but false for others(conjugacy closed, Bol, central, extra, Burn, A-,\nhomogeneous) except if their holomorphs are nuclear or central. A necessary and\nsufficient condition for the Nuclear-holomorph of a Smarandache Bol loop to be\na Smarandache Bruck loop is shown. Whence, it is found also to be a Smarandache\nKikkawa loop if in addition the loop is a Smarandache A-loop with a centrum\nholomorph. Under this same necessary and sufficient condition, the\nCentral-holomorph of a Smarandache A-loop is shown to be a Smarandache K-loop.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jan 2007 17:11:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-10"}

Using the formalism of decoherent histories, it investigates\nwhether intuitions about intrinsic time directedness that are often associated\nwith probability can be justified in the context of no-collapse approaches to\nquantum mechanics. The standard (two-vector) approach to time symmetry in the\ndecoherent histories literature is criticised, and an alternative approach is\nproposed, based on two decoherence conditions ('forwards' and 'backwards')\nwithin the one-vector formalism. In turn, considerations of forwards and\nbackwards decoherence and of decoherence and recoherence suggest that a\ntime-directed interpretation of probabilities, if adopted, should be both\ncontingent and perspectival.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jan 2007 03:37:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The\nthermal light beam is divided into test and reference beams which are\ncorrelated with each other. The double-slit is set in the test arm, and the\ninterference pattern can be observed in the intensity correlation between the\ntwo arms. The experimental results show that the disappearance of interference\nfringe depends on whether which-path information is gained through the\nreference arm. The experiment therefore witnesses the complementarity occurring\nin a macroscopic system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jan 2007 11:14:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
