For the CMEs that are\ndriven, we examine if they might be deriving most of their driving power by\ncoupling to the solar wind. We do not find conclusive evidence in favor of this\nhypothesis. On the other hand, we find that their internal magnetic energy is a\nviable source of the required driving power. We have estimated upper and lower\nlimits on the power that can possibly be provided by the internal magnetic\nfield of a CME. We find that, on average, the lower limit to the available\nmagnetic power is around 74% of what is required to drive the CMEs, while the\nupper limit can be as much as an order of magnitude larger.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jan 2007 12:48:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Feb 2007 11:21:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

RunCMS runs as a 680 MB\nimage in memory that includes 540 dynamic libraries, and is used for the CMS\nexperiment of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. DMTCP transparently\ncheckpoints general cluster computations consisting of many nodes, processes,\nand threads; as well as typical desktop applications.

A second and more recent one,\ninstead, begins with a ``puncture'' solution and then evolves the full\n3-metric, including the singular point. In the continuum limit, excision is\njustified by the light-cone structure of the Einstein equations and, in\npractice, can give accurate numerical solutions when suitable discretizations\nare used. However, because the field variables are non-differentiable at the\npuncture, there is no proof that the moving-punctures technique is correct,\nparticularly in the discrete case. To investigate this question we use both\ntechniques to evolve a binary system of equal-mass non-spinning black holes. We\ncompare the evolution of two curvature 4-scalars with proper time along the\ninvariantly-defined worldline midway between the two black holes, using\nRichardson extrapolation to reduce the influence of finite-difference\ntruncation errors.

In this paper we introduce\nthe concept of truncated states obtained via iterative processes (TSI) and\nstudy its statistical features, making an analogy with dynamical systems theory\n(DST). As a specific example, we have studied TSI for the doubling and the\nlogistic functions, which are standard functions in studying chaos. TSI for\nboth the doubling and logistic functions exhibit certain similar patterns when\ntheir statistical features are compared from the point of view of DST. A\ngeneral method to engineer TSI in the running-wave domain is employed, which\nincludes the errors due to the nonidealities of detectors and photocounts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jan 2007 14:49:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
