As observed in recent experiments, we find that the\nterraced \"wedding-cake\" structure of Mott plateaus splits the spectrum into a\nseries of discrete peaks. The spectra are extremely sensitive to density\ncorrugations and trap anharmonicities. For example, even when the majority of\nthe cloud is superfluid the spectrum displays discrete peaks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2007 17:53:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-11"}

Typically,\nthese components are linear combinations of the rows and columns of the matrix,\nand are thus difficult to interpret in terms of the original features of the\ninput data. In this paper, we propose and study matrix approximations that are\nexplicitly expressed in terms of a small number of columns and/or rows of the\ndata matrix, and thereby more amenable to interpretation in terms of the\noriginal data. Our main algorithmic results are two randomized algorithms which\ntake as input an $m \\times n$ matrix $A$ and a rank parameter $k$. In our first\nalgorithm, $C$ is chosen, and we let $A'=CC^+A$, where $C^+$ is the\nMoore-Penrose generalized inverse of $C$. In our second algorithm $C$, $U$, $R$\nare chosen, and we let $A'=CUR$. ($C$ and $R$ are matrices that consist of\nactual columns and rows, respectively, of $A$, and $U$ is a generalized inverse\nof their intersection.) For each algorithm, we show that with probability at\nleast $1-\\delta$: $$ ||A-A'||_F \\leq (1+\\epsilon) ||A-A_k||_F, $$ where $A_k$\nis the ``best'' rank-$k$ approximation provided by truncating the singular\nvalue decomposition (SVD) of $A$.

A new method to probe the circumstellar environment has been\nexploited for the normal Type Ia SN 2006X, leading for the first time to the\ndirect detection of material which escaped the progenitor system.

In this respect the peculiar Type Ia SN 2000cx is different from the\nnormal Ia SN 2006X.

This is the most\nextensive PAH halo yet detected in a normal galaxy. This halo shows\nsubstructure and the PAHs likely originate from some type of disk outflow. PAHs\nare long-lived in a halo environment and therefore continuous replenishment\nfrom the disk is not required (unless halo PAHs are also being destroyed or\nremoved), consistent with the current low SFR of the galaxy. The PAHs correlate\nspatially with halo H$\\alpha$ emission, previously observed by Miller &\nVeilleux (2003); both components are likely excited/ionized by in-disk photons\nthat are leaking into the halo.

The platform moves in the Cartesian space with fixed\norientation, similar to conventional XYZ-machine. Three strategies have been\nproposed to define the Orthoglide geometric parameters (manipulator link\nlengths and actuated joint limits) as functions of a cubic workspace size and\ndextrous properties expressed by bounds on the velocity transmission factors,\nmanipulability or the Jacobian condition number. Low inertia and intrinsic\nstiffness have been set as additional design goals expressed by the minimal\nlink length requirement.
