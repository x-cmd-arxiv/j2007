We adopt a\ncosmologically-motivated model where dSphs are approximated by a King model\nembedded within an NFW halo. We find that these NFW-embedded King models are\nextraordinarily resilient to tides; the stellar density profile still resembles\na King model even after losing more than 99% of the stars. As tides strip the\ngalaxy, the stellar luminosity, velocity dispersion, central surface\nbrightness, and core radius decrease monotonically. Remarkably, we find that\nthe evolution of these parameters is solely controlled by the total amount of\nmass lost from within the luminous radius. Of all parameters, the core radius\nis the least affected: after losing 99% of the stars, R_c decreases by just a\nfactor of ~2. Interestingly, tides tend to make dSphs more dark-matter\ndominated because the tightly bound central dark matter ``cusp'' is more\nresilient to disruption than the ``cored'' King profile. We examine whether the\nextremely large M/L ratios of the newly-discovered ultra-faint dSphs might have\nbeen caused by tidal stripping of once brighter systems. Although dSph tidal\nevolutionary tracks parallel the observed scaling relations in the\nluminosity-radius plane, they predict too steep a change in velocity dispersion\ncompared with the observational estimates hitherto reported in the literature.\nThe ultra-faint dwarfs are thus unlikely to be the tidal remnants of systems\nlike Fornax, Draco, or Sagittarius. Despite spanning four decades in\nluminosity, dSphs appear to inhabit halos of comparable peak circular velocity,\nlending support to scenarios that envision dwarf spheroidals as able to form\nonly in halos above a certain mass threshold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Aug 2007 19:00:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2007 22:03:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

However, the rationale of\nintroducing stock capitalization in the scaling is unclear and the anomalous\nnegative correlation between price change $r$ and trade size $\\omega$ for small\ntrades is unexplained.

We performed\na stacking analysis of the hard X-ray spectra of AGN detected in two recent\nall-sky surveys, performed by the IBIS/ISGRI instrument aboard INTEGRAL and by\nthe PCA instrument aboard RXTE, taking into account the space densities of AGN\nwith different luminosities and absorption column densities.

The cumulative spectrum exhibits (although with marginal\nsignificance) a cutoff at energies above 100-200 keV and is consistent with the\nCXB spectrum if AGN evolve over cosmic time in such a way that the SED of their\ncollective high-energy emission has a constant shape and the relative fraction\nof obscured AGN remains nearly constant, while the AGN luminosity density\nundergoes strong evolution between z~1 and z=0, a scenario broadly consistent\nwith results from recent deep X-ray surveys. The first direct comparison\nbetween the collective hard X-ray SED of local AGN and the CXB spectrum\ndemonstrates that the popular concept of the CXB being a superposition of AGN\nis generally correct.

The most obvious feature of the X-ray morphology of A3128\nis the presence of two X-ray peaks separated by ~12'. By detecting the\nredshifted Fe K line, we find that the Northeast (NE) X-ray peak observed\ntoward A3128 is a distant luminous cluster of galaxies at redshift z=0.44. Our\nsubsequent optical spectroscopic observation of a distant radio bright galaxy\nin the centre of the NE X-ray peak with the Magellan telescope also revealed a\nredshift of z=0.44, confirming the association of the galaxy with the cluster\nseen in X-rays. We detect a gravitational arc around the galaxy. The properties\nof this galaxy indicate that it is the cD galaxy of the cluster in the\nbackground. The properties of the Southwest X-ray peak suggest that it is the\ncore of a group merging with A3128 along our line of sight. Based on 2D maps of\nthermodynamic properties of the intra-cluster medium determined after\nsubtracting a model for the background cluster, we conclude that an enhanced\nsurface brightness region at a distance of ~2.8' from the centre of the galaxy\ndistribution is the centre of the gravitational potential of the cluster A3128.\nThe unrelaxed nature of A3128 can be attributed to its location in the high\ndensity environment of the Horologium-Reticulum supercluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Aug 2007 21:34:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

From the radial velocity curves we confirm the\npresence of a stellar bar, and find that the super star cluster M82-A1 has a\nposition and radial velocity consistent with it being at the end of one of the\nunique x2 bar orbits formed by an inner Lindblad resonance.
