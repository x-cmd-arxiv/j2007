We\nexpand around Newtonian gravity on linear, subhorizon scales with coefficient\nfunctions in front of the expansion parameter. Our framework relies on an\nansatz which ensures that (i) the Poisson equation is recovered on small scales\n(ii) the metric variables (and any additional fields) are generated and\nsupported by the nonrelativistic matter overdensity. The scales for which our\nframework is intended are small enough so that cosmic variance does not\nsignificantly limit the accuracy of the measurements and large enough to avoid\ncomplications from nonlinear effects and baryon cooling. The coefficient\nfunctions provide a general framework for contrasting the consequences of\nLambda CDM and its alternatives. We calculate the coefficient functions for\ngeneral relativity with a cosmological constant and dark matter, GR with dark\nmatter and quintessence, scalar-tensor theories, f(R) gravity and braneworld\nmodels.

These adaptive mesh refinement simulations produce both CC and\nNCC clusters in the same volume. They have a peak resolution of 15.6 h^{-1} kpc\nwithin a (256 h^{-1} Mpc)^3 box. Our simulations suggest that there are\nimportant evolutionary differences between CC clusters and their NCC\ncounterparts. Many of the numerical CC clusters accreted mass more slowly over\ntime and grew enhanced cool cores via hierarchical mergers; when late major\nmergers occurred, the CC's survived the collisions. By contrast, NCC clusters\nexperienced major mergers early in their evolution that destroyed embryonic\ncool cores and produced conditions that prevented CC re-formation. As a result,\nour simulations predict observationally testable distinctions in the properties\nof CC and NCC beyond the core regions in clusters. In particular, we find\ndifferences between CC versus NCC clusters in the shapes of X-ray surface\nbrightness profiles, between the temperatures and hardness ratios beyond the\ncores, between the distribution of masses, and between their supercluster\nenvirons. It also appears that CC clusters are no closer to hydrostatic\nequilibrium than NCC clusters, an issue important for precision cosmology\nmeasurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2007 20:46:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2007 21:33:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

A number of studies, aimed at its experimental verification, have found\nadequate supportive evidence in its favour. Theoretical investigations,\nhowever, have been few, perhaps because formulating a population-genetic model\nfor describing the Trivers-Willard hypothesis turns out to be surprisingly\ncomplex. The present study describes a minimal population genetic model to\nexplore one specific scenario, viz. how is the preference for a male offspring\nby females in good condition altered when 'g', the proportion of such females\nin the population changes from a low to a high value. As expected, when the\nproportion of such females is low, i.e., for low values of 'g', the\nTrivers-Willard (TW) strategy goes to fixation against the equal investment\nstrategy. This holds true up to gmax, a critical value of 'g', above which the\ntwo strategies coexist, but the proportion of the TW strategy steadily\ndecreases as 'g' increases to unity. Similarly, when the effect of well-endowed\nmales attaining disproportionately high number of matings is more pronounced,\nthe TW strategy is more likely to go to fixation. Interestingly, the success of\nthe TW strategy has a complex dependence on the variance in the physiological\ncondition of females. If the difference in the two types of conditions is not\nlarge, TW strategy is favoured, and its success is more likely as the\ndifference increases. However, beyond a critical value of the difference, the\nTW strategy is found to be less and less likely to succeed as the difference\nbecomes larger.

The only\nconserved macroscopic quantity is the total energy $E$ (the total energy of the\nrelic radiation). Data for a boundary-value approach, with massless,\ninteger-spin perturbations, are set on initial and final space-like\nhypersurfaces. In the resulting 1-dimensional statistical-mechanics problem,\nthe real part of the (complex) time separation at spatial infinity, $T =\n{\\mid}T{\\mid}\\exp(-i\\delta), \\delta >0$, is the variable conjugate to the total\nenergy. We count the number of weak-field configurations on the final\nspace-like hypersurface with energy $E$. One recovers the Cardy formula and the\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy, if Re(T) is of the order of the black-hole life-\ntime, leading to a statistical interpretation of black-hole entropy. The\nmicrocanonical entropy includes a logarithmic correction to the black-hole area\nlaw, which is {\\it universal} (independent of black-hole parameters). Here, the\ndiscreteness of the energy levels is crucial. This approach is compared with\nthat of string theory for the transition to the fundamental-string r\\'egime in\nthe final stages of evaporation. The squared coupling, $g^2$, regulating the\ntransition to a highly-excited string state and {\\it vice versa}, can be\nrelated to the angle, $\\delta$, of complex-time rotation above. The\nstrong-coupling r\\'egime corresponds to a Euclidean black hole, while the\nphysical limit of a Lorentzian space-time (as $ \\delta \\to 0_+$) corresponds to\nthe weak-coupling r\\'egime. This resembles the transition to a highly-excited\nstring-like state which subsequently decays into massless particles, thereby\navoiding the naked singularity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2007 09:20:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
