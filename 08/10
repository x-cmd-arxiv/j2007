In the case where the bulge is assumed to\nbe viewed edge-on, the kinematical data give only an upper limit to the mass of\nthe BH of ~4e7 M_sun (1 sigma). If the bulge kinematic axis is assumed to have\nthe same inclination as the symmetry axis of the large-scale galaxy disk (i.e.,\n23 degrees relative to the line of sight), a best-fit dynamical mass between\n4-5e7 M_sun is obtained. However, because of the poor quality of the fit when\nthe bulge is assumed to be inclined (as determined by the noisiness of the\nchi^2 surface and its minimum value), and because we lack spectroscopic data\nthat clearly resolves the BH sphere of influence, we consider our measurements\nto be tentative estimates of the dynamical BH mass.

The Yukawa and soft trilinear and scalar mass squared matrices and\nkinetic terms are expanded in powers of the flavons used to spontaneously break\nthe SU(3) family symmetry, and the canonically normalized versions of these\nmatrices are constructed. The soft mass matrices are then expressed in the\nSuper-CKM basis, and the leading order mass insertion parameters are\ncalculated, and are shown to satisfy the experimental constraints from flavour\nchanging neutral current processes. Assuming that CP is spontaneously broken by\nthe flavons, the next-to-leading order effects responsible for CP violation are\nthen estimated, and the predictions for electric dipole moments are shown to be\nan order of magnitude more suppressed than those predicted from the constrained\nminimal supersymmetric standard model (CMSSM), and may be further suppressed if\nthe high energy trilinear soft parameter is assumed to be relatively small. We\nalso predict that, unlike in the CMSSM, epsilon_K'/epsilon_K may be dominated\nby the SUSY operator O_8. We also discuss the additional constraints from\nunification, which can lead to further predictions for flavour changing in our\nscheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2007 17:08:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2007 10:58:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 Mar 2008 11:18:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 14 Jul 2008 14:15:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-06"}

In\nparticular, the Se and Kr enrichments display a positive correlation with\nnebular C/O ratios, as theoretically expected. Peimbert Type I PNe and bipolar\nPNe, whose progenitors are believed to be intermediate-mass stars (>3-4 M_sun),\nexhibit little or no s-process enrichment. Interestingly, PNe with H-deficient\n[WC] central stars do not exhibit systematically larger s-process enrichments\nthan other PNe, despite the fact that their central stars are enriched in C and\nprobably n-capture elements. Finally, the few PNe in our sample with known or\nprobable binary central star systems exhibit little s-process enrichment, which\nmay be explained if binary interactions truncated their AGB phases. We also\nbriefly discuss a new observational program to detect optical emission lines of\nn-capture elements, and new atomic data calculations that will greatly improve\nthe accuracy of n-capture element abundance determinations in PNe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2007 19:34:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-08-10"}

Very recently, however, meaningful experimental studies of the problem\nhave finally become possible, stimulating theoretical interest as well.\nProgress in this field is perhaps most urgently needed in the foundations of\nquantum statistical mechanics. This is so because in generic isolated systems,\none expects nonequilibrium dynamics on its own to result in thermalization: a\nrelaxation to states where the values of macroscopic quantities are stationary,\nuniversal with respect to widely differing initial conditions, and predictable\nthrough the time-tested recipe of statistical mechanics. However, it is not\nobvious what feature of many-body quantum mechanics makes quantum\nthermalization possible, in a sense analogous to that in which dynamical chaos\nmakes classical thermalization possible. For example, dynamical chaos itself\ncannot occur in an isolated quantum system, where time evolution is linear and\nthe spectrum is discrete. Underscoring that new rules could apply in this case,\nsome recent studies even suggested that statistical mechanics may give wrong\npredictions for the outcomes of relaxation in such systems. Here we demonstrate\nthat an isolated generic quantum many-body system does in fact relax to a state\nwell-described by the standard statistical mechanical prescription. Moreover,\nwe show that time evolution itself plays a merely auxiliary role in relaxation\nand that thermalization happens instead at the level of individual eigenstates,\nas first proposed by J.M. Deutsch and M. Srednicki. A striking consequence of\nthis eigenstate thermalization scenario is that the knowledge of a single\nmany-body eigenstate suffices to compute thermal averages-any eigenstate in the\nmicrocanonical energy window will do, as they all give the same result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2007 20:00:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2009 00:29:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-11"}

The BCG was clearly detected in all Spitzer\nbandpasses, including the 70 and 160 micron wavebands. We report aperture\nphotometry of the BCG. The spectral energy distribution exhibits a clear excess\nin the FIR over a Rayleigh-Jeans stellar tail, indicating a star formation rate\nof ~4-5 solar masses per year, consistent with the estimates from the UV and\nits H-alpha luminosity. This large FIR luminosity is consistent with that of a\nstarburst or a Luminous Infrared Galaxy (LIRG), but together with a very\nmassive and old population of stars that dominate the energy output of the\ngalaxy. If the dust is at one temperature, the ratio of 70 to 160 micron fluxes\nindicate that the dust emitting mid-IR in this source is somewhat hotter than\nthe dust emitting mid-IR in two BCGs at higher-redshift (z~0.2-0.3) and higher\nFIR luminosities observed earlier by Spitzer, in clusters Abell 1835 and Zwicky\n3146.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2007 14:14:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We concentrate on the waves excited by\ncore convection in a 3Msun, Pop I main sequence star. Here, we want to examine\nthe role of the Coriolis acceleration in the equations of motion that describe\nthe behavior of waves and to evaluate its impact on angular momentum transport.\nWe use the so-called traditional approximation of geophysics, which allows\nvariable separation in radial and horizontal components. In the presence of\nrotation, the horizontal structure is described by Hough functions instead of\nspherical harmonics. The Coriolis acceleration has two main effects on waves.\nIt transforms pure gravity waves into gravito-inertial waves that have a larger\namplitude closer to the equator, and it introduces new waves whose restoring\nforce is mainly the conservation of vorticity. Taking the Coriolis acceleration\ninto account changes the subtle balance between prograde and retrograde waves\nin non-rotating stars. It also introduces new types of waves that are either\npurely prograde or retrograde. We show in this paper where the local deposition\nof angular momentum by such waves is important.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2007 15:44:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
