From this, one can estimate the amount of historical\ninformation the process stores. More generally, causal filtering finds a graded\nmodel-complexity hierarchy of approximations to the causal architecture. Abrupt\nchanges in the hierarchy, as a function of approximation, capture distinct\nscales of structural organization.\n  For nonideal cases with finite data, we show how the correct number of\nunderlying causal states can be found by optimal causal estimation.

The surface\nbrightness carries information on the line-of-sight dust column density.\nTherefore, scattered light could provide an important tool to study mass\ndistribution in quiescent interstellar clouds at a high, even sub-arcsecond\nresolution.

We have obtained NIR images of a\nquiescent filament in the Corona Australis molecular cloud. The observations\nprovide maps of diffuse surface brightness in J, H, and Ks bands. Using the\nassumption that signal is caused by scattered light we convert surface\nbrightness data into a map of dust column density. The same observations\nprovide colour excesses for a large number of background stars. These data are\nused to derive an extinction map of the cloud. The two, largely independent\ntracers of the cloud structure are compared. Results. In regions below Av=15m\nboth diffuse surface brightness and background stars lead to similar column\ndensity estimates. The existing differences can be explained as a result of\nnormal observational errors and bias in the sampling of extinctions provided by\nthe background stars. There is no indication that thermal dust emission would\nhave a significant contribution even in the Ks band. The results show that,\nbelow Av=15mag, scattered light does provide a reliable way to map cloud\nstructure.
