Substructure properties\nare culled directly from cosmological simulations of galaxy-sized cold dark\nmatter (CDM) halos. In contrast to what can be inferred from statistics of the\npresent-day substructure populations, accretions of massive subhalos onto the\ncentral regions of host halos, where the galactic disk resides, since z~1\nshould be common occurrences. One host halo merger history is subsequently used\nto seed controlled numerical experiments of repeated satellite impacts on an\ninitially-thin Milky Way-type disk galaxy. We show that these accretion events\nproduce several distinctive observational signatures in the stellar disk\nincluding: a ring-like feature in the outskirts; a significant flare; a central\nbar; and faint filamentary structures that (spuriously) resemble tidal streams.\nThe final distribution of disk stars exhibits a complex vertical structure that\nis well-described by a standard ``thin-thick'' disk decomposition. We conclude\nthat satellite-disk encounters of the kind expected in LCDM models can induce\nmorphological features in galactic disks that are similar to those being\ndiscovered in the Milky Way, M31, and in other disk galaxies. These results\nhighlight the significant role of CDM substructure in setting the structure of\ndisk galaxies and driving galaxy evolution. Upcoming galactic structure surveys\nand astrometric satellites may be able to distinguish between competing\ncosmological models by testing whether the detailed structure of galactic disks\nis as excited as predicted by the CDM paradigm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2007 19:13:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Jul 2008 17:31:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-28"}

For the case that the\nopen system dynamics are fully controllable, it is shown that the control\nlandscape for open systems can be lifted to the analysis of an equivalent\nauxiliary landscape of a closed composite system that contains the\nenvironmental interactions. This inherent connection can be analyzed to provide\nrelevant information about the topology of the original open system landscape.\nApplication to the optimization of an observable expectation value reveals the\nsame landscape simplicity observed in former studies on closed systems. In\nparticular, no false sub-optimal traps exist in the system control landscape\nwhen seeking to optimize an observable, even in the presence of complex\nenvironments. Moreover, a quantitative study of the control landscape of a\nsystem interacting with a thermal environment shows that the enhanced\ncontrollability attainable with open dynamics significantly broadens the range\nof the achievable observable values over the control landscape.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Aug 2007 01:10:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-04"}

QCD-vacuum behaves effectively like\na \"paramagnetic system\" of a classical theory in the sense that virtual color\ncharges (gluons) emerges in it as a spin effect of a paramagnetic material when\na magnetic field aligns their microscopic magnetic dipoles. Due to that strong\nclassical analogy with the paramagnetism of Landau's theory,we will be able to\nuse a certain Landau effective action without temperature and phase transition\nfor just representing QCD-vacuum behavior at higher energies as being\nmagnetization of a paramagnetic material in the presence of a magnetic field\n$H$. This reasoning will allow us to apply Thompson's approach to such an\naction in order to extract an \"effective susceptibility\" ($\\chi>0$) of\nQCD-vacuum. It depends on logarithmic of energy scale $u$ to investigate\nhadronic matter. Consequently we are able to get an ``effective magnetic\npermeability\" ($\\mu>1$) of such a \"paramagnetic vacuum\".

The aim is to better\nunderstand how the assumption of axial symmetry affects reconstructed masses\nand stellar motions of systems which are intrinsically not axisymmetric,\nwhether it leads to a bias and how such a potential bias can be recognised in\nmodels of real galaxies. The mass recovery at the half-light radius depends on\nviewing-angle and intrinsic shape: edge-on views allow to reconstruct total\nmasses with an accuracy between 20% (triaxial/prolate remnants) and 3% (oblate\nremnant). Masses of highly flattened, face-on systems are underestimated by up\nto 50%. Deviations in local mass densities can be larger where remnants are\nstrongly triaxial or prolate. Luminous M/L are sensitive to box orbits in the\nremnants. Box orbits cause the central kinematics to vary with viewing-angle.\nReconstructed luminous M/L and central masses follow this variation. Luminous\nM/L are always underestimated (up to a factor of 2.5). Respective dark halos in\nthe models can be overestimated by about the same amount, depending again on\nviewing angle. Reconstructed velocity anisotropies depend on viewing angle and\non the orbital composition of the remnant.

A popular method for analyzing such\nfunctional data is ``smoothing first, then estimation.'' That is, statistical\ninference such as estimation and hypothesis testing about functional data is\nconducted based on the substitution of the underlying individual functions by\ntheir reconstructions obtained by one smoothing technique or another. However,\nlittle is known about this substitution effect on functional data analysis. In\nthis paper this problem is investigated when the local polynomial kernel (LPK)\nsmoothing technique is used for individual function reconstructions. We find\nthat under some mild conditions, the substitution effect can be ignored\nasymptotically. Based on this, we construct LPK reconstruction-based estimators\nfor the mean, covariance and noise variance functions of a functional data set\nand derive their asymptotics. We also propose a GCV rule for selecting good\nbandwidths for the LPK reconstructions. When the mean function also depends on\nsome time-independent covariates, we consider a functional linear model where\nthe mean function is linearly related to the covariates but the covariate\neffects are functions of time. The LPK reconstruction-based estimators for the\ncovariate effects and the covariance function are also constructed and their\nasymptotics are derived. Moreover, we propose a $L^2$-norm-based global test\nstatistic for a general hypothesis testing problem about the covariate effects\nand derive its asymptotic random expression. The effect of the bandwidths\nselected by the proposed GCV rule on the accuracy of the LPK reconstructions\nand the mean function estimator is investigated via a simulation study.
