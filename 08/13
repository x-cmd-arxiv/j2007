We revisit this issue by analyzing both the 2dFGRS and SDSS DR5\ncatalogues using essentially identical techniques. We confirm that the 2dFGRS\nexhibits relatively more large scale power than the SDSS, or, equivalently,\nSDSS has more small scale power. We demonstrate that this difference is due to\nthe r-band selected SDSS catalogue being dominated by more strongly clustered\nred galaxies, which have a stronger scale dependent bias. The power spectra of\ngalaxies of the same rest frame colours from the two surveys match well. If not\naccounted for, the difference between the SDSS and 2dFGRS power spectra causes\na bias in the obtained constraints on cosmological parameters which is larger\nthan the uncertainty with which they are determined. We also found that the\ncorrection developed by Cole et al.(2005) to model the distortion in the shape\nof the power spectrum due to non-linear evolution and scale dependent bias is\nnot able to reconcile the constraints obtained from the 2dFGRS and SDSS power\nspectra. Intriguingly, the model is able to describe the differences between\nthe 2dFGRS and the much more strongly clustered LRG sample, which exhibits\ngreater nonlinearities. This shows that more work is needed to understand the\nrelation between the galaxy power spectrum and the linear perturbation theory\nprediction for the power spectrum of matter fluctuations. It is therefore\nimportant to accurately model these effects to get precise estimates of\ncosmological parameters from these power spectra and from future galaxy surveys\nlike Pan-STARRS, or the Dark Energy Survey, which will use selection criteria\nsimilar to the one of SDSS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2007 14:28:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2007 14:59:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-28"}

Here we report results of experiments of molecular hydrogen\nformation on amorphous silicate surfaces using temperature-programmed\ndesorption (TPD). In these experiments beams of H and D atoms are irradiated on\nthe surface of an amorphous silicate sample. The desorption rate of HD\nmolecules is monitored using a mass spectrometer during a subsequent TPD run.\nThe results are analyzed using rate equations and the activation energies of\nthe processes leading to molecular hydrogen formation are obtained from the TPD\ndata. We show that a model based on a single isotope provides the correct\nresults for the activation energies for diffusion and desorption of H atoms.\nThese results can thus be used to evaluate the formation rate of H_2 on dust\ngrains under the actual conditions present in interstellar clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2007 06:16:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Nov 2008 06:23:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-21"}

A conventional Boltzmann transport analysis with no basal-plane\nanisotropy in the cyclotron frequency $\\omega_c$ or transport lifetime $\\tau$\nis shown to be inadequate for explaining the data. We describe in detail how\nthe analysis can be modified to incorporate in-plane anisotropy in these two\nkey quantities and extract the degree of anisotropy for each by assuming a\nsimple four-fold symmetry. While anisotropy in $\\omega_c$ and other Fermi\nsurface parameters may improve the fit, we demonstrate that the most important\nanisotropy is that in the transport lifetime, thus confirming its role in the\nphysics of overdoped superconducting cuprates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2007 09:29:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
