AGB stars are the primary sources of PAHs\nand carbon dust in galaxies, and recycle their ejecta back to the interstellar\nmedium only after a few hundred million years of evolution on the main\nsequence. In contrast, more massive stars that explode as Type II supernovae\ninject their metals and dust almost instantaneously after their formation.

All model components: the galaxies' stellar content, properties of\ntheir HII regions, and their ionizing and non-ionizing radiation fields and\ndust abundances, are constrained by their observed multiwavelength spectrum.\nAfter determining the PAH and dust abundances in 35 nearby galaxies using our\nSED model, we use a chemical evolution model to show that the delayed injection\nof carbon dust by AGB stars provides a natural explanation to the dependence of\nthe PAH content in galaxies with metallicity.

Although the operator is not BPS, it has a\nfinite expectation value at least up to order (g^2 N)^2. This does not happen\ngenerally for a generic non-BPS Wilson loop whose expectation value is UV\ndivergent. For this reason we call this a near-BPS Wilson loop and conjecture\nthat its exact expectation value is finite. We derive the general form of the\nboundary condition satisfied by the dual string worldsheet and find that it is\ndeformed. Finiteness of the expectation value of the Wilson loop, together with\nsome rather remarkable properties of the Lunin-Maldacena metric and the\nB-field, fixes the boundary condition to be one which is characterized by the\nvielbein of the deformed supergravity metric. The Wilson loop operators provide\nnatural candidates as dual descriptions to some of the existing D-brane\nconfigurations in the Lunin-Maldacena background. We also construct the string\ndual configuration for a near-1/4 BPS circular Wilson loop operator. The string\nlies on a deformed three-sphere instead of a two-sphere as in the undeformed\ncase. The expectation value of the Wilson loop operator is computed using the\nAdS/CFT correspondence and is found to be independent of the deformation. We\nconjecture that the exact expectation value of the Wilson loop is given by the\nsame matrix model as in the undeformed case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2007 17:13:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Aug 2007 13:23:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2007 10:59:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-03"}

In the first phase, nodes\ntransmit locally in a random access time-slotted fashion. Simultaneous\ntransmissions from multiple source nodes are viewed as linear mixtures of all\ntransmitted packets. In the second phase, a set of collaborating nodes, acting\nas a distributed antenna system, beamform the received analog waveform to one\nor more faraway destinations. This step requires multiplication of the received\nanalog waveform by a complex weight, which is independently computed by each\ncooperating node, and which allows packets bound to the same destination to add\ncoherently at the destination node.

The time scale of the decay suggests we may have\nseen the tail-end of a long-duration burst. Low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) are\nknown to emit thermonuclear X-ray bursts that are sometimes modulated by the\nspin frequency of the star, the so called burst oscillations. The pulsations\nreported here are peculiar if interpreted as canonical burst oscillations. In\nparticular, the pulse train lasted for ~500 s, much longer than in standard\nburst oscillations. The signal was highly coherent and drifted down by ~2x10^-3\nHz, much smaller than the ~Hz drifts typically observed during normal bursts.\nThe pulsations are reminiscent of those observed during the much more energetic\n``superbursts'', however, the temporal profile and the energetics of the burst\nsuggest that it was not the tail end nor the precursor feature of a superburst.\nIt is possible that we caught the tail end of an outburst from a new\n`intermittent'' accreting X-ray millisecond pulsar, a phenomenon which until\nnow has only been seen in HETE J1900.1$-$2455 (Galloway et al. 2007).

Based on the observed properties of parity-check\nmatrices with good stopping redundancy characteristics, we develop a novel\ndecoding technique, termed automorphism group decoding, that combines iterative\nmessage passing and permutation decoding. We also present bounds on the\nsmallest number of permutations of an automorphism group decoder needed to\ncorrect any set of erasures up to a prescribed size. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that for a large number of algebraic codes, the performance of the\nnew decoding method is close to that of maximum likelihood decoding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2007 09:55:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2008 19:05:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2008 15:38:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

The most well-known example is the fixed-jump\n(0,1) circulant matrix which, using algebraic techniques, was shown by Minc to\nsatisfy a constant-coefficient fixed-order recurrence relation.\n  In this note we show how, by interpreting the problem as calculating the\nnumber of cycle-covers in a directed circulant graph, it is straightforward to\nreprove Minc's result using combinatorial methods. This is a two step process:\nthe first step is to show that the cycle-covers of directed circulant graphs\ncan be evaluated using a transfer matrix argument. The second is to show that\nthe associated transfer matrices, while very large, actually have much smaller\ncharacteristic polynomials than would a-priori be expected.\n  An important consequence of this new viewpoint is that, in combination with a\nnew recursive decomposition of circulant-graphs, it permits extending Minc's\nresult to calculating the permanent of the much larger class of circulant\nmatrices with non-fixed (but linear) jumps. It also permits us to count other\ntypes of structures in circulant graphs, e.g., Hamiltonian Cycles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2007 09:20:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

In order to provide constructive answers to\nthis general optimal risk transfer problem, both static and dynamic approaches\nare considered.

Simple\ntheoretical arguments suggest that the magnification of these images should be\napproximately equivalent, whereas one image is observed to be significantly\ndemagnified. Microlensing provides a possible explanation for this discrepancy.\nThere are two key parameters when modelling this effect. The first, the\nfraction of smooth matter in the lens at the image positions, has been explored\nby Schechter and Wambsganss (2002). They have shown that the anomalous flux\nratio observed in the lensed quasar MG 0414+0534 is a priori a factor of 5 more\nlikely if the assumed smooth matter content in the lens model is increased from\n0% to 93%. The second parameter, the size of the emission region, is explored\nin this paper, and shown to be more significant.

The spectrum of the\nunperturbed gyroscopic system forms a \"spectral mesh\" in the plane \"frequency\n-gyroscopic parameter\" with double semi-simple purely imaginary eigenvalues at\nzero value of the gyroscopic parameter. It is shown that dissipative forces\nlead to the splitting of the semi-simple eigenvalue with the creation of the\nso-called \"bubble of instability\" - a ring in the three-dimensional space of\nthe gyroscopic parameter and real and imaginary parts of eigenvalues, which\ncorresponds to complex eigenvalues. In case of full dissipation with a\npositive-definite damping matrix the eigenvalues of the ring have negative real\nparts making the bubble a latent source of instability because it can \"emerge\"\nto the region of eigenvalues with positive real parts due to action of both\nindefinite damping and non-conservative positional forces. In the paper, the\ninstability mechanism is analytically described with the use of the\nperturbation theory of multiple eigenvalues. As an example stability of a\nrotating circular string constrained by a stationary load system is studied in\ndetail. The theory developed seems to give a first clear explanation of the\nmechanism of self-excited vibrations in the rotating structures in frictional\ncontact, that is responsible for such well-known phenomena of acoustics of\nfriction as the squealing disc brake and the singing wine glass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2007 14:51:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2007 19:46:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-04"}
