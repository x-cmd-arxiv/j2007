The exact formation\nmechanism is unclear, but it is possible that some massive stars are formed by\nprocesses similar to those that produce the low-mass stars, with\naccretion/ejection phenomena occurring at some point of the evolution of the\nprotostar. This picture seems to be supported by the detection of a collimated\nstellar wind emanating from the massive protostar IRAS 16547-4247. A triple\nradio source is associated with the protostar: a compact core and two radio\nlobes. The emission of the southern lobe is clearly non-thermal. Such emission\nis interpreted as synchrotron radiation produced by relativistic electrons\nlocally accelerated at the termination point of a thermal jet.

Because of the confirmed presence of relativistic electrons,\ninverse Compton and relativistic Bremsstrahlung interactions are unavoidable.\nProton-proton collision should also occur, producing an injection of neutral\npions.

HH 555\nis a bipolar jet emerging from the tip of an elephant trunk entering the\nPelican Nebula from the adjacent molecular cloud. Both beams of HH 555 are\ncurved away from the center of the H II region. This indicates that they are\nbeing deflected by a side-wind probably coming from a star located inside the\nnebula or by the expansion of the nebula itself. HH 555 is most likely an\nirradiated jet emerging from a highly embedded protostar, which has not yet\nbeen detected.\n  In our simulations we vary the incident photon flux, which in one of our\nmodels is equal to the flux coming from a star 1 pc away emitting 5x10^48\nionizing (i. e., with energies above the H Lyman limit) photons per second. An\nexternal, plane-parallel flow (a ``side-wind'') is coming from the same\ndirection as the photoionizing flux. We have made four simulations, decreasing\nthe photon flux by a factor of 10 in each simulation. We discuss the properties\nof the flow and we compute Halpha emission maps (integrated along lines of\nsight).\n  We show that the level of the incident photon flux has an important influence\non the shape and visibility of the jet. If the flux is very high, it causes a\nstrong evaporation of the neutral clump, producing a photoevaporated wind\ntraveling in the direction opposite to the incident flow. The interaction of\nthe two flows creates a double shock ``working surface'' around the clump\nprotecting it and the jet from the external flow. The jet only starts to curve\nwhen it penetrates through the working surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2007 17:00:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

This subject has also\ninspired much technological interest, largely motivated by applications\ninvolving nanoscale superconducting circuit elements, e.g., standards based on\nquantum phase-slip junctions. While phase slips caused by thermal fluctuations\nat high temperatures are well understood, controversy remains over the role of\nphase slips in small-scale superconductors. In solids, problems such as\nuncontrolled noise sources and disorder complicate the study and application of\nphase slips. Here we show that phase slips can lead to dissipation for a clean\nand well-characterized Bose-Hubbard (BH) system by experimentally studying\ntransport using ultra-cold atoms trapped in an optical lattice. In contrast to\nprevious work, we explore a low velocity regime described by the 3D BH model\nwhich is not affected by instabilities, and we measure the effect of\ntemperature on the dissipation strength. We show that the damping rate of\natomic motion-the analogue of electrical resistance in a solid-in the confining\nparabolic potential fits well to a model that includes finite damping at zero\ntemperature. The low-temperature behaviour is consistent with the theory of\nquantum tunnelling of phase slips, while at higher temperatures a cross-over\nconsistent with the transition to thermal activation of phase slips is evident.\nMotion-induced features reminiscent of vortices and vortex rings associated\nwith phase slips are also observed in time-of-flight imaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2007 19:08:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2007 03:27:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Jun 2008 15:57:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The question\nis whether this can happen in a Lorentz-invariant way. We consider the use of\nfour scalar fields that break coordinate reparametrization invariance, by\nplaying the role of preferred flat coordinates x, y, z, and t. In the unbroken\nrepresentation, the theory has a (negative) cosmological constant, which is\ntuned to zero by the scalars in the broken phase. Massive spin 2 bosons and a\nsingle massive scalar survive. The theory is not renormalizable, so at best it\ncan be viewed as an effective field theory for massive spin 2 particles. One\nmay think of applications in cosmology, but a more tantalizing idea is to apply\nit to string theory approaches to QCD: if the gluon sector is to be described\nby a compactified 26 or 10 dimensional bosonic string theory, then the ideas\nconsidered here could be used to describe the mechanism that removes a massless\nor tachyonic scalar and provides mass to the spin 2 glueball states. The\ndelicate problem of removing indefinite metric and/or negative energy states is\naddressed. The scalar particle has negative metric, so that unitarity demands\nthat only states with an even number of them are allowed. Various ways are\nconsidered to adapt the matter section of the theory such that matter only\ncouples to positive metric states, and we succeed in suppressing the main\ncontributions to unitarity-violating amplitudes, but the exact restoration of\nunitarity in the spinless sector will continue to be a delicate issue in\ntheories of this sort.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Aug 2007 14:13:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2007 14:53:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2007 11:09:35 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2008 11:26:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-07"}
