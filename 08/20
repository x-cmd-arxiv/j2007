We present high-quality optical spectra for 12 powerful radio\nsources at low and intermediate redshifts (z < 0.7) that show evidence for a\nsubstantial UV excess.

The results of our spectral synthesis model fits to the\nspectra highlight the importance of taking into account AGN-related components\n(emission lines, nebular continuum, scattered light) and reddening of the\nstellar populations in studies of this type. It is also clear that careful\nexamination of the fits to the spectra, as well consideration of auxilary\npolarimetric and imaging data, are required to avoid degeneracies in the model\nsolutions.

In the\nremaining 9 sources we find strong evidence for YSPs. In contrast to some\nrecent studies that suggest relatively old post-starburst ages for the YSPs in\nradio galaxies (0.3-2.5 Gyr), we deduce a wide range of ages for the YSPs in\nour sample objects (0.02-1.5 Gyr), with ~50% of the sample showing evidence for\nyoung YSP ages (<~0.1 Gyr) in their nuclear regions. The nuclear YSPs are often\nsignificantly reddened (0.2 < E(B-V) < 1.4) and make up a substantial fraction\n(~1-35%) of the total stellar mass in the regions sampled by the spectroscopic\nslits. Moreover, in all the cases in which we have sufficient spatial\nresolution we find that the UV excess is extended across the full measureable\nextent of the galaxy (typically 5-30 kpc), suggesting galaxy-wide starbursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2007 08:44:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We study the Parkes half-Jansky sample of GPS\nradio galaxies of which now all host galaxies have been identified and 80% has\ntheir redshifts determined (0.122 < z < 1.539). Analysis of the absolute\nmagnitudes of the GPS host galaxies show that at z > 1 they are on average a\nmagnitude fainter than classical 3C radio galaxies. This suggests that the AGN\nin young radio galaxies have not yet much influenced the overall properties of\nthe host galaxy. However their restframe UV luminosities indicate that there is\na low level of excess as compared to passive evolution models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2007 14:34:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Quantitative tracking of chain\nconformation statistics on the Kuhn scale is essential for developing\ncomputational models of such phenomena. For this purpose, we formulate here a\ntwo-scale/two-mode model of entangled polymer chains under flow. Each chain is\npartitioned by successive entanglements into strands that are in one of two\nmodes: entangled or dangling. On the strand scale, conformation statistics of\nideal (non-interacting) strands follows a differential evolution equation for\nthe second moment of its end-to-end distance. The latter regulates persistent\nrandom walks sampling conformation statistics of ideal entangled strands on the\nKuhn scale, as follows from a generalized Green-Kubo relation and the Maximum\nEntropy Principle. We test it numerically for a range of deformation rates at\nthe start-up of simple elongational and shear flows. A self-consistent\npotential, representing segmental interactions, modifies strand conformation\nstatistics on the Kuhn scale, as it renormalizes the parameters controlling the\npersistent random walk. The generalized Green-Kubo relation is then inverted to\ndetermine how the second moment of the strand end-to-end distance is changed by\nthe self-consistent potential. This allows us to devise a two-scale propagation\nscheme for the statistical weights of subchains of the entangled chain. The\nlatter is used to calculate local volume fractions for each chemical type of\nKuhn segments in entangled chains, thus determining the self-consistent\npotential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2007 15:06:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-08-21"}
