The relationship between r\nand Omega_gw(f) depends sensitively on the uncertain physics of the early\nuniverse, and we show that this uncertainty may be encapsulated (in a\nmodel-independent way) by two quantities: w_hat(f) and nt_hat(f), where\nnt_hat(f) is a certain logarithmic average over nt(k) (the primordial tensor\nspectral index); and w_hat(f) is a certain logarithmic average over w_tilde(a)\n(the effective equation-of-state in the early universe, after horizon\nre-entry).

In this paper, we\nstudy the nearly ordinary deformations of rho. When K is totally real and rho\nis modular, results of Hida imply that the nearly ordinary deformation space\nassociated to rho contains a Zariski dense set of points corresponding to\n\"automorphic\" Galois representations. We conjecture that if K is_not_ totally\nreal, then this is never the case, except in three exceptional cases,\ncorresponding to (1) \"base change\", (2) \"CM\" forms, and (3) \"Even\"\nrepresentations. The latter case conjecturally can only occur if the image of\nrho is finite. Our results come in two flavours. First, we prove a general\nresult for Artin representations, conditional on a strengthening of Leopoldt's\nconjecture. Second, when K is an imaginary quadratic field, we prove an\nunconditional result that implies the existence of \"many\" positive dimensional\ncomponents (of certain deformation spaces) that do not contain infinitely many\nclassical points. Also included are some speculative remarks about \"p-adic\nfunctorality\", as well as some remarks on how our methods should apply to\nn-dimensional representations of Gal(Qbar/Q) when n > 2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Aug 2007 23:25:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2008 22:29:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-17"}

The X-ray bremsstrahlung emission from non-thermal electrons is\ncharacterized by two spectroscopically distinct phases: impulsive and gradual.\nThe impulsive phase usually consists of several emission spikes following a\nsoft-hard-soft spectral pattern, whereas the gradual stage manifests itself as\nspectral hardening while the flux slowly decreases. Both the soft-hard-soft\n(impulsive) phase and the hardening (gradual) phase are well described by\npiecewise linear dependence of the photon spectral index on the logarithm of\nthe hard X-ray flux. The different linear parts of this relation correspond to\ndifferent rise and decay phases of emission spikes. The temporal evolution of\nthe spectra is compared with the configuration and motion of the hard X-ray\nsources in RHESSI images. These observations reveal that the two stages of\nelectron acceleration causing these two different behaviors are closely related\nin space and time. The transition between the impulsive and gradual phase is\nfound to be smooth and progressive rather than abrupt.

Although the light curve in the presence of a small\nshear is similar to the simple Paczynski curve with a slightly smaller impact\nparameter, the detailed difference between the light curve with and without\nshear reflects the direction and the magnitude of the shear. The centroid shift\ntrajectory also deviates from a simple ellipse in the presence of shear. The\ndistortion of the centroid shift trajectory increases as the impact parameter\ndecreases, and the shape of the trajectory becomes complicated when the impact\nparameter becomes small enough.

We explain this effect, which is known as Thomas precession, by considering\na real grid that moves along with the gyroscope, and that by definition is not\nrotating as observed from its own momentary inertial rest frame. From the basic\nproperties of the Lorentz transformation we deduce how the form and rotation of\nthe grid (and hence the gyroscope) will evolve relative to S. As an\nintermediate step we consider how the grid would appear if it were not length\ncontracted along the direction of motion. We show that the uncontracted grid\nobeys a simple law of rotation. This law simplifies the analysis of spin\nprecession compared to more traditional approaches based on Fermi transport. We\nalso consider gyroscope precession relative to an accelerated reference frame\nand show that there are extra precession effects that can be explained in a way\nanalogous to the Thomas precession.
