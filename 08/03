However, the absence of a typical X-ray\nafterglow from GRB 070610 in conjunction with the spatial and temporal\ncoincidence of the two motivate us to suggest that the sources are related.

The source signal arrives at the destination\nvia N hops through N-1 layers of relays. We analyze the diversity of such\nchannels with fixed network size at high SNR. In the clustered case where the\nrelays within the same layer can have full cooperation, the cooperative\ndecode-and-forward (DF) scheme is shown to be optimal in terms of the\ndiversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT). The upper bound on the DMT, the cut-set\nbound, is attained. In the non-clustered case, we show that the naive\namplify-and-forward (AF) scheme has the maximum multiplexing gain of the\nchannel but is suboptimal in diversity, as compared to the cut-set bound. To\nimprove the diversity, space-time relay processing is introduced through the\nparallel partition of the multihop channel. The idea is to let the source\nsignal go through K different \"AF paths\" in the multihop channel. This parallel\nAF scheme creates a parallel channel in the time domain and has the maximum\ndiversity if the partition is properly designed. Since this scheme does not\nachieve the maximum multiplexing gain in general, we propose a flip-and-forward\n(FF) scheme that is built from the parallel AF scheme.

The ghost is caused by light reflected off the detector surface,\nrecollimated by the camera, recombined by, and reflected from, the grating and\nreimaged by the camera onto the detector. This recombination can occur in two\ndifferent ways. We observe this ghost in two spectrographs being developed by\nthe University of Wisconsin - Madison: the Robert Stobie Spectrograph for the\nSouthern African Large Telescope and the Bench Spectrograph for the WIYN 3.5m\ntelescope. The typical ratio of the brightness of the ghost relative to the\nintegrated flux of the spectrum is of order 10^-4, implying a recombination\nefficiency of the VPH gratings of order 10^-3 or higher, consistent with the\noutput of rigorous coupled wave analysis. Any spectrograph employing VPH\ngratings, including grisms, in Littrow configuration will suffer from this\nghost, though the general effect is not intrinsic to VPH gratings themselves\nand has been observed in systems with conventional gratings in non-Littrow\nconfigurations.

I.\nHartman and C. Nissim-Sabat in this journal. Several phenomena were said to\nviolate the principle of relativity as applied to rotating motion. These claims\nhave recently been contested. However, in neither of these articles have the\ngeneral relativistic phenomenon of inertial dragging been invoked, and no\ncalculation have been offered by either side to substantiate their claims. Here\nI discuss the possible validity of the principle of relativity for rotating\nmotion within the context of the general theory of relativity, and point out\nthe significance of inertial dragging in this connection. Although my main\npoints are of a qualitative nature, I also provide the necessary calculations\nto demonstrate how these points come out as consequences of the general theory\nof relativity\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Aug 2007 06:19:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-24"}

For each of the outbursts we derived the best-fit value of the time\nof ascending node passage. We find that these times follow a parabolic trend,\nwhich gives an orbital period derivative $\\dot P_{\\rm orb} = (3.40 \\pm 0.18)\n\\times 10^{-12}$ s/s, and a refined estimate of the orbital period, $P_{\\rm\norb} = 7249.156499 \\pm 1.8 \\times 10^{-5}$ s (reference epoch $T_0 =\n50914.8099$ MJD). This derivative is positive, suggesting a degenerate or fully\nconvective companion star, but is more than one order of magnitude higher than\nwhat is expected from secular evolution driven by angular momentum losses\ncaused by gravitational radiation under the hypothesis of conservative mass\ntransfer. Using simple considerations on the angular momentum of the system, we\npropose an explanation of this puzzling result assuming that during X-ray\nquiescence the source is ejecting matter (and angular momentum) from the inner\nLagrangian point.

We refer to these mixtures as semi-parametric\nbecause no additional assumptions other than symmetry are made regarding the\nparametric form of the component distributions. Because the class of symmetric\ndistributions is so broad, identifiability of parameters is a major issue in\nthese mixtures. We develop a notion of identifiability of finite mixture\nmodels, which we call k-identifiability, where k denotes the number of\ncomponents in the mixture. We give sufficient conditions for k-identifiability\nof location mixtures of symmetric components when k=2 or 3. We propose a novel\ndistance-based method for estimating the (location and mixing) parameters from\na k-identifiable model and establish the strong consistency and asymptotic\nnormality of the estimator. In the specific case of L_2-distance, we show that\nour estimator generalizes the Hodges--Lehmann estimator. We discuss the\nnumerical implementation of these procedures, along with an empirical estimate\nof the component distribution, in the two-component case.

In\ncase the free surface is flat, a sharp criterion of linear instability is\nestablished for a general class of shear flows with inflection points and the\nmaximal unstable wave number is found. Comparison to the rigid-wall setting\ntestifies that free surface has a destabilizing effect. For a class of unstable\nshear flows, the bifurcation of nontrivial periodic traveling waves of\nsmall-amplitude is demonstrated at any wave number. We show the linear\ninstability of small nontrivial waves bifurcated at an unstable wave number of\nthe background shear flow. The proof uses a new formulation of the linearized\nwater-wave problem and a perturbation argument. An example of the background\nshear flow of unstable small-amplitude periodic traveling waves is constructed\nfor an arbitrary vorticity strength and for an arbitrary depth, illustrating\nthat vorticity has a subtle influence on the stability of water waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Aug 2007 15:53:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2007 20:04:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-11-28"}
