The problem is reduced to evaluating the partition function\nof a replicated classical one dimensional Coulomb gas. The state of the latter\ndepends on two parameters: the number of transverse channels in the wire,\nN_{ch}, and the dimensionless conductance, G(L_T), of a wire segment of length\nequal to the thermal diffusion length, L_T. At relatively high temperatures,\n$G(L_T) \\gtrsim \\ln N_{ch} $, the gas is dimerized, i.e. consists of bound\nneutral pairs.

The crossover between the two\nregimes occurs at a parametrically large conductance $G(L_T) \\sim \\ln N_{ch}$,\nand may be studied independently from the perturbative effects.
