Such studies have delineated the `fragmentation boundary'\nin terms of a critical value of beta_{cool} (beta_{crit}), where the disc\nfragments if beta_{cool} < beta_{crit}. Such an approach however begs the\nquestion of how in reality a disc could ever be assembled with beta_{cool} <\nbeta_{crit}. Here we adopt the more realistic approach of gradually reducing\nbeta_{cool}, as might correspond to changes in thermal regime due to secular\nchanges in the disc density profile. We find that when beta_{cool} is gradually\nreduced (on a timescale longer than t_{cool}), the disc is stabilised against\nfragmentation, compared with models in which beta_{cool} is reduced rapidly. We\ntherefore conclude that a disc's ability to remain in a self-regulated,\nself-gravitating state (without fragmentation) is partly dependent on its\nthermal history, as well as its current cooling rate. Nevertheless, a slow\nreduction in t_{cool} appears only to lower the fragmentation boundary by about\na factor two in t_{cool} and thus only permits maximum alpha values\n(parameterising the efficiency of angular momentum transfer in the disc) that\nare about a factor two higher than determined hitherto. Our results therefore\ndo not undermine the notion of a fundamental upper limit to the heating rate\nthat can be delivered by gravitational instabilities before the disc is subject\nto fragmentation. An important implication of this work, therefore, is that\nself-gravitating discs can enter into the regime of fragmentation via secular\nevolution and it is not necessary to invoke rapid (impulsive) events to trigger\nfragmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2007 11:03:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We study the motion of SMBHs ejected from galaxy cores by such kicks\nand the effects on the stellar distribution using high-accuracy direct N-body\nsimulations. Following the kick, the motion of the SMBH exhibits three distinct\nphases. (1) The SMBH oscillates with decreasing amplitude, losing energy via\ndynamical friction each time it passes through the core. Chandrasekhar's theory\naccurately reproduces the motion of the SMBH in this regime if 2 < ln Lambda <\n3 and if the changing core density is taken into account. (2) When the\namplitude of the motion has fallen to roughly the core radius, the SMBH and\ncore begin to exhibit oscillations about their common center of mass. These\noscillations decay with a time constant that is at least 10 times longer than\nwould be predicted by naive application of the dynamical friction formula. (3)\nEventually, the SMBH reaches thermal equilibrium with the stars. We estimate\nthe time for the SMBH's oscillations to damp to the Brownian level in real\ngalaxies and infer times as long as 1 Gyr in the brightest galaxies.
