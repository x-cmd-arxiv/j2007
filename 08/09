The IMF can nevertheless be constrained statistically by\nevolving many theoretical populations drawn from one parent distribution and\ntesting these against observed populations. It follows that all known\nwell-resolved stellar populations are consistent with having been drawn from\nthe same parent mass distribution. The IMF Universality Hypothesis therefore\ncannot be discarded despite the existence of the Cluster IMF Theorem. This\nmeans that the currently existing star-formation theory fails to describe the\nstellar outcome, because it predicts a dependency of the IMF on the physical\nboundary conditions not observed. The IGIMF Theorem, however, predicts a\nvariation of galaxy-wide IMFs in dependence of the galaxy's star-formation rate\neven if the IMF Universality Hypothesis is valid. This variation has now been\nobserved in SDSS galaxy data. Detailed analysis of the binary properties in the\nvery-low-mass star and brown dwarf (BD) mass regime on the one hand, and in the\nstellar regime on the other, shows there to be a discontinuity in the IMF near\n0.1Msun such that BDs follow a separate distribution function. Very recent\nobservations of the stellar population within 1pc of the nucleus of the MW do\nsuggest a top-heavy IMF, perhaps hinting at a variation of the star-formation\noutcome with tidal field and temperature thereby violating the IMF Universality\nHypothesis under these physically extreme conditions. Another violation of this\nhypothesis appears to emerge for extremely metal-poor stars such that the\nprimordial IMF appears to have been depleted in low-mass stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2007 20:04:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-08-10"}

This enables to derive the renormalized\nquantities in a manifestly cutoff independent way and to present them in the\nform of strongly convergent integrals. However, applications of the Abel-Plana\nformula, in its usual form, are restricted by simple geometries when the\neigenmodes have a simple dependence on quantum numbers. The author generalized\nthe Abel-Plana formula which essentially enlarges its application range. Based\non this generalization, formulae have been obtained for various types of series\nover the zeros of combinations of Bessel functions and for integrals involving\nthese functions. It has been shown that these results generalize the special\ncases existing in literature. Further, the derived summation formulae have been\nused to summarize series arising in the direct mode summation approach to the\nCasimir effect for spherically and cylindrically symmetric boundaries, for\nboundaries moving with uniform proper acceleration, and in various braneworld\nscenarios. This allows to extract from the vacuum expectation values of local\nphysical observables the parts corresponding to the geometry without boundaries\nand to present the boundary-induced parts in terms of integrals strongly\nconvergent for the points away from the boundaries. As a result, the\nrenormalization procedure for these observables is reduced to the corresponding\nprocedure for bulks without boundaries. The present paper reviews these\nresults. We also aim to collect the results on vacuum expectation values for\nlocal physical observables such as the field square and the energy-momentum\ntensor in manifolds with boundaries for various bulk and boundary geometries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2007 21:49:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-12-03"}

Such extensions have been carried out along with the development of\nefficient methods for obtaining nondiffracting beams and pulses in the\nsubluminal, luminal and superluminal regimes[11-18]. This paper (partly a\nreview) addresses some theoretical methods related to nondiffracting solutions\nof the linear wave equation in unbounded homogeneous media, as well as to some\ninteresting applications of such waves. In section II we analyze the general\nstructure of the Localized Waves, develop the so called Generalized\nBidirectional Decomposition, and use it to obtain several luminal and\nsuperluminal (especially X-shaped) nondiffracting solutions of the wave\nequation. In section III we develop a space-time focusing method by a\ncontinuous superposition of X-Shaped pulses of different velocities. Section IV\naddresses the properties of chirped optical X-Shaped pulses propagating in\nmaterial media without boundaries. Finally, in Section V, we show how a\nsuitable superposition of Bessel beams can be used to obtain stationary\nlocalized wave fields, with a static envelope and a high transverse\nlocalization, and whose longitudinal intensity pattern can assume any desired\nshape within a chosen interval of the propagation axis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2007 03:40:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-31"}

The wide emission component can be seen to extend from -170 to +120\nkm/s, and at its central part it is cut by an absorption feature, which, in\nturn, is split into two subcomponents by a narrow (16km/s at r=2.5) emission\npeak.

A novel feature of this\ndevice is that by reversing the polarity of the applied voltage the\nluminescence can be selectively obtained from either the nanowire or the\nsubstrate. For one polarity of the applied voltage, ultraviolet (and visible)\nlight is generated in the GaN nanowire, while for the opposite polarity\ninfrared light is emitted from the Si substrate. We propose a model, which\nexplains the key features of the data, based on electron tunnelling from the\nvalence band of one semiconductor into the conduction band of the other\nsemiconductor. For example, for one polarity of the applied voltage, given a\nsufficient potential energy difference between the two semiconductors,\nelectrons can tunnel from the valence band of GaN into the Si conduction band.\nThis process results in the creation of holes in GaN, which can recombine with\nconduction band electrons generating GaN band-to-band luminescence. A similar\nprocess applies under the opposite polarity for Si light emission. This device\nstructure affords an additional experimental handle to the study of\nelectroluminescence in single nanowires and, furthermore, could be used as a\nnovel approach to two-colour light-emitting devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2007 14:00:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2007 12:38:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-09-04"}

The overall effect is increased\nlight transmission intensity by more than a factor of three beyond the already\nenhanced transmission, independent of whether the Bragg mirrors are on the\ninput or the output side of the incident light. The geometry of the Bragg\nmirror structures controls the enhancement, and can even reduce the\ntransmission in half. By varying these geometric parameters, we were able to\nperiodically modulate the transmission of light for specific wavelengths,\nconsistent with the propagation and interference of surface plasmon waves in a\nresonant cavity. FDTD simulations and a wave propagation model verify this\neffect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2007 15:47:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-11"}

The pulsations were seen during both 2001 and 2005 outbursts of the\nsource, but only intermittently, appearing and disappearing on timescales of\nhundreds of seconds. We find a suggestive relation between the occurrence of\ntype-I X-ray bursts and the appearance of the pulsations but the relation is\nnot strict. This behavior is very similar to that of the intermittent accreting\nmillisecond X-ray pulsar HETE J1900.1--2455. The reason for the intermittence\nof the pulsations remains unclear. However it is now evident that a strict\ndivision between pulsating and non-pulsating does not exist. By studying the\nDoppler shift of the pulsation frequency we determine an orbit with a period of\n8.7 hrs and an projected semi major axis of 0.39 lightsec. The companion star\nmight be a main--sequence or a slightly evolved star with a mass of $\\sim$1\n$M_\\odot$. Therefore, SAX J1748.9--2021 has a longer period and may have a more\nmassive companion star than all the other accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars\nexcept for Aql X-1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2007 15:49:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2008 17:25:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
