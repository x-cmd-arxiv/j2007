As the signature of an enzyme family, a catalytic domain\nis easily fingerprinted. Given that the classification problem has so far\nseemed intractable, a classification schema derived from the catalytic domain\nwould be satisfying. Here I show that there exists a natural ab initio if\nnonobvious basis to theorize that the catalytic domain of an enzyme is uniquely\ninformative about its regulation. This annotates its function. Based on this\nhypothesis, a method that correctly classifies potassium ion channels into\ntheir respective subfamilies is described. To put the principle on firmer\nground, extra validation was sought and obtained through co-evolutionary\nanalyses. The co-evolutionary analyses reveal a departure from the notion that\npotassium ion channel proteins are functionally modular. This finding is\ndiscussed in light of the prevailing notion of domain. These studies establish\nthat significant co-evolution of the catalytic domain of a gene with its\nconjoint domain is a specialized, necessary process following fusion and\nswapping events in evolution. Instances of this discovery are likely to be\nfound pervasive in protein science.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Aug 2007 16:58:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-08-17"}

When\ncomparing with data for F-K stars in the coeval Hyades, we find a dramatic drop\nin the periods at spectral type K8-M2 (corresponding to 0.4-0.6Ms). A\ncomparison with periods of VLM stars in younger clusters provides a constraint\non the spin-down timescale: We find that the exponential rotational braking\ntimescale is clearly longer than 200 Myr, most likely 400-800 Myr. These\nresults are not affected by the small sample size in the rotation periods. Both\nfindings, the steep drop in the period-mass relation and the long spin-down\ntimescale, indicate a substantial change in the angular momentum loss mechanism\nfor very low mass objects, possibly the breakdown of the solar-type (Skumanich)\nrotational braking.

These observations allow us, for the first time, to\ninvestigate quantitatively the possible relations between the radio emission\nand the presence of the hard X-ray tails and the X-ray state of the source. The\nobservations show: 1) a coupling between the radio jet emission and the X-ray\nstate of the source, i.e. the position in the X-ray hardness-intensity diagram\n(HID); 2) a coupling between the presence of a hard X-ray tail and the position\nin the HID, qualitatively similar to that found for the radio emission; 3) an\nindication for a quantitative positive correlation between the radio flux\ndensity and the X-ray flux in the hard-tail power law component; 4) evidence\nfor the formation of a radio jet associated with the Flaring Branch-to-Normal\nBranch X-ray state transition; 5) that the radio flux density of the\nnewly-formed jet stabilizes when also the normal-branch oscillation (NBO) in\nthe X-ray power spectrum stabilizes its characteristic frequency, suggesting a\npossible relation between X-ray variability associated to the NBO and the jet\nformation.

Thus the\ncrustal-interface wave plays no dynamical role during the burst, and no early\nQPO cut-off should occur.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Aug 2007 10:10:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

This behavior\nleads to geodetic incompleteness which in turn predicts the existence of a\nsingularity. In this work we inquire on whether, in gravitational collapse,\nspacetime can sustain singularity-free trapped surfaces, in the sense that such\na spacetime remains geodetically complete. As a test case, we consider a well\nknown solution of the Einstien Field Equations which is Schwarzschild-like at\nlarge distances and consists of a fluid with a $p=-\\rho $ equation of state\nnear $r=0$. By following both the expansion parameters $\\theta ^{+}$ and\n$\\theta ^{-}$ across the horizon and into the black hole we find that both\n$\\theta ^{+}$ and $\\theta ^{+}\\theta ^{-}$ have turning points inside the\ntrapped region. Further, we find that deep inside the black hole there is a\nregion $0\\leq r<r_{0}$ (that includes the black hole center) which is not\ntrapped. Thus the trapped region is bounded both from outside and inside. The\nspacetime is geodetically complete, a result which violates a condition for\nsingularity formation. It is inferred that in general if gravitational collapse\nwere to proceed with a $p=-\\rho $ fluid formation, the resulting black hole may\nbe singularity-free.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Aug 2007 12:59:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Theoretical interpretation of what one observes requires the theory to\nindicate what is expected, which will commonly depend on where, and\nparticularly when, the observation can be expected to occur. In response to the\nquestion of where and when, the original version of the anthropic principle\nproposed an {it a priori} probability weighting proportional to the number of\n``anthropic'' observers present. The present discussion takes up the question\nof the time unit characterising the biological clock controlling our subjective\ninternal time, using a revised alternative to a line of argument due to Press,\nwho postulated that animal size is limited by the brittleness of bone. On the\nbasis of a static support condition depending on the tensile strength of flesh\nrather than bone, it is reasoned here that our size should be subject to a\nlimit inversely proportional to the terrestrial gravitation field g, which is\nitself found to be proportional (with a factor given by the 5/2 power of the\nfine structure constant) to the gravitational coupling constant.This provides\nan animal size limit that will in all cases be of the order of a thousandth of\nthe maximum mountain height, which will itself be of the order of a thousandth\nof the planetary radius. The upshot, via the (strong) anthropic principle, is\nthat the need for brains, and therefore planets, that are large in terms of\nbaryon number may be what explains the weakness of gravity relative to\nelectromagnetism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Aug 2007 14:35:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2007 09:44:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-23"}

This forms part of a larger and on-going study of\nthe formation and collimation mechanisms of galactic winds, including three\nadditional IFU pointings in NGC 1569 covering the base of the galactic wind\nwhich are analysed in a companion paper. The good spatial- and\nspectral-resolution of these GMOS/IFU observations, covering 4740-6860 A, allow\nus to probe the interactions between clusters and their environments on small\nscales. Combining our GMOS spectrum with HST imaging, we find that cluster 10\nis composed of two very close components with ages of 5-7 Myr and <5 Myr, and a\ncombined mass of 7 +/- 5 x 10^3 Msun.\n  A detailed analysis of the H_alpha emission line profile shapes across the\nwhole field-of-view shows them to be composed of a bright narrow feature\n(intrinsic FWHM ~ 50 km/s) superimposed on a fainter broad component (FWHM <\n300 km/s). By mapping the properties of each individual component, we\ninvestigate the small-scale structure and properties of the ionized ISM,\nincluding reddening, excitation and electron densities, and for the first time\nfind spatial correlations between the line component properties. We discuss in\ndetail the possible mechanisms that could give rise to the two components and\nthese correlations, and conclude that the most likely explanation for the broad\nemission is that it is produced in a turbulent mixing layer on the surface of\nthe cool gas clumps embedded within the hot, fast-flowing cluster winds. We\nconclude we are sampling well within the outer bounding shocks of the expanding\nsuperbubbles and within the outflow 'energy injection zone'.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Aug 2007 15:03:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Indeed, the inverse of\nthe Type II Wishart forms a conjugate family of priors for the covariance\nparameter of the graphical Gaussian model and is strong directed hyper Markov\nfor every direction given to the graph by a perfect order of its cliques, while\nthe Type I Wishart is weak hyper Markov. Moreover, the inverse Type II Wishart\nas a conjugate family presents the advantage of having a multidimensional shape\nparameter, thus offering flexibility for the choice of a prior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Aug 2007 15:10:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}
