However, ascorbic\nacid had no synergistic effect along with other COX inhibitors (SC-58125 and\nindomethacin). The inhibition of IL-1beta-mediated PGE2 synthesis by ascorbic\nacid was not due to the inhibition of the expression of COX-2 or microsomal\nprostaglandin E synthase (mPGES-1). Rather, ascorbic acid dose-dependently\n(0.1-100 microM) produced a significant reduction in IL-1beta-mediated\nproduction of 8-iso-prostaglandin F2alpha (8-iso-PGF2alpha), a reliable\nindicator of free radical formation, suggesting that the effects of ascorbic\nacid on COX-2-mediated PGE2 biosynthesis may be the result of the maintenance\nof the neuronal redox status since COX activity is known to be enhanced by\noxidative stress.

Old\nglobulars show the full range of eccentricities, while younger ones seem to\nhave preferentially high eccentricities, again hinting at their extraGalactic\norigin. We compare detailed abundances of a variety of elements between the\nhalo and all dwarf galaxies studied to date, including both dwarf spheroidals\nand irregulars. The salient feature is that halo abundances are essentially\nunique. In particular, the general alpha vs. [Fe/H] pattern of 12 of the 13\ngalaxies studied are similar to each other and very different from the Milky\nWay. Sagittarius appears to be the only possible exception. It appears very\nunlikely that a significant fraction of the metal-rich halo could have come\nfrom disrupted dwarf galaxies of low mass. However, at least some of the\nmetal-poor halo may have come from typical dwarfs, and a portion of the\nintermediate metallicity halo may have come from very massive systems. The\nchemical differences between the dwarfs and the halo are due to a combination\nof a low star formation efficiency and a high galactic wind efficiency in the\nformer. The formation problem may be solved if the majority of halo stars\nformed within a few, very massive satellites accreted very early.

The extant radio observations and X-ray\ndata which we have independently re-reduced, together with new optical\nspectroscopy of the large-scale fragmented nebulosity, confirms the\nidentification. Optical spectra, taken across five different, widely separated\nnebula regions of the remnant as seen on the HAlpha images, show average ratios\nof [NII]/HAlpha =2.42, [SII]/HAlpha = 2.10, and [SII] 6717/6731 = 1.23, as well\nas strong [OI] 6300, 6364A and [OII] 3727A emission.

Future\ndetectors should observe gravitational waves generated during inspirals of\ncompact objects into supermassive central bodies. If the central body deviates\nfrom the Kerr metric, this will manifest itself in the emitted waves. Here, we\nexplore some of the features of orbits in non-Kerr spacetimes that might lead\nto observable signatures. As a basis for this analysis, we use a family of\nexact solutions proposed by Manko & Novikov which deviate from the Kerr metric\nin the quadrupole and higher moments, but we also compare our results to other\nwork in the literature. We examine isolating integrals of the orbits and find\nthat the majority of geodesic orbits have an approximate fourth constant of the\nmotion (in addition to the energy, angular momentum and rest mass) and the\nresulting orbits are tri-periodic to high precision. We also find that this\nfourth integral can be lost for certain orbits in some oblately deformed\nManko-Novikov spacetimes. However, compact objects will probably not end up on\nthese chaotic orbits in nature. We compute the location of the innermost stable\ncircular orbit (ISCO) and find that the behavior of orbtis near the ISCO can be\nqualitatively different depending on whether the ISCO is determined by the\nonset of an instability in the radial or vertical direction. Finally, we\ncompute periapsis and orbital-plane precessions for nearly circular and nearly\nequatorial orbits in both the strong and weak field, and discuss weak-field\nprecessions for eccentric equatorial orbits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Aug 2007 13:48:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2008 12:26:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The\nG-inversion symmetric gapless B phase near the phase boundaries is described by\n1+1-dimensional gapless Majorana fermions in the asymptotic long wave length\nlimit, i.e. the $c=1/2$ conformal field theory.
