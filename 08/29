Such asymmetries are usually neglected\nin abundance analyses. The determination of the 6Li/7Li isotopic ratio is prone\nto suffering from such asymmetries, as the contribution of 6Li is a slight\nblending reinforcement of the red wing of each component of the corresponding\n7Li line, with respect to its blue wing. Aims: The present paper studies the\nhalo star HD 74000 and estimates the impact of convection-related asymmetries\non the Li isotopic ratio determination. Method: Two methods are used to meet\nthis aim. The first, which is purely empirical, consists in deriving a template\nprofile from another element that can be assumed to originate in the same\nstellar atmospheric layers as Li I, producing absorption lines of approximately\nthe same equivalent width as individual components of the 7Li I resonance line.\nThe second method consists in conducting the abundance analysis based on NLTE\nline formation in a 3D hydrodynamical model atmosphere, taking into account the\neffects of photospheric convection. Results: The results of the first method\nshow that the convective asymmetry generates an excess absorption in the red\nwing of the 7Li absorption feature that mimics the presence of 6Li at a level\ncomparable to the hitherto published values. This opens the possibility that\nonly an upper limit on 6Li/7Li has thus far been derived. The second method\nconfirms these findings.

The game is perhaps the simplest possible probabilistic game in which\nperception affects reality. By varying the `reality map', which relates the\namount wagered to the probability of the outcome, it is possible to move\ncontinuously from a purely objective game in which probabilities have no\ndependence on wagers, to a purely subjective game in which probabilities equal\nthe amount wagered. The reality map can reflect self-reinforcing strategies or\nself-defeating strategies. In self-reinforcing games, rational players can\nachieve increasing returns and manipulate the outcome probabilities to their\nadvantage; consequently, an early lead in the game, whether acquired by chance\nor by strategy, typically gives a persistent advantage.

The importance of these second stars for understanding the\norigin of the elements in the early universe are manifold. While the massive\nfirst stars have long vanished the second stars are still around and currently\nobserved. They are the carriers of the information about the first stars, but\nthey are also capable of nuclear production themselves. For example, in order\nto use ultra or extremely metal-poor stars as a probe for the r-process in the\nearly universe a reliable model of the s-process in the second stars is needed.\nEventually, the second stars may provide us with important clues on questions\nranging from structure formation to how the stars actually make the elements,\nnot only in the early but also in the present universe. In particular the\nC-rich extremely metal-poor stars, most of which show the s-process signature,\nare thought to be associated with chemical yields from the evolved giant phase\nof intermediate mass stars. Models of such AGB stars at extremely low\nmetallicity now exist, and comparison with observation show important\ndiscrepancies, for example with regard to the synthesis of nitrogen. This may\nhint at burning and mixing aspects of extremely metal-poor evolved stars that\nare not yet included in the standard picture of evolution, as for example the\nhydrogen-ingestion flash. The second stars of intermediate mass may have also\nplayed an important role in the formation of heavy elements that form through\nslow neutron capture reaction chains (s-process). Comparison of models with\nobservations reveal which aspects of the physics input and assumptions need to\nbe improved. The s-process is a particularly useful diagnostic tool for probing\nthe physical processes that are responsible for the creation of elements in\nstars, like for example rotation.

I use BUDDA v2.1 to produce the fits, allowing to include bars\nand AGN in the models. A comparison with previous results from the literature\nshows a fairly good agreement. It is found that the axial ratio of bars, as\nmeasured from ellipse fits, can be severely underestimated if the galaxy\naxisymmetric component is relatively luminous. Thus, reliable bar axial ratios\ncan only be determined by taking into account the contributions of bulge and\ndisc to the light distribution in the galaxy image. Through a number of tests,\nI show that neglecting bars when modelling barred galaxies can result in a\noverestimation of the bulge-to-total luminosity ratio of a factor of two.\nSimilar effects result when bright, type 1 AGN are not considered in the\nmodels. By artificially redshifting the images, I show that the structural\nparameters of more distant galaxies can in general be reliably retrieved\nthrough image fitting, at least up to the point where the physical spatial\nresolution is ~ 1.5 Kpc.

PVA is used as a Carbon source. PVA\ndoping effects made two distinguishable contributions: first enhancement of Jc\nfield performance and second an increase in Hc2 value, both because of carbon\nincorporation into MgB2 crystal lattice. The susceptibility measurement reveals\nthat Tc decreased from 37 to 36 K. Lattice parameter a decreased from 3.085 A\nto 3.081 A due to the partial substitution of Carbon at Boron site. PVA doped\nsample exhibited the Jc values greater than 10^5 A/cm2 at 5 & 10 K at low\nfields; which is almost 3 times higher than the pure one, while at high fields\nthe Jc is increased by an order of magnitude in comparison to pure MgB2. From\nR(T)H measurements we found higher Tc values under magnetic field for doped\nsample; indicating an increase in Hc2. Also the magnetization measurements\nexhibited a significant enhancement in Hirr value. The improved performance of\nPVA doped MgB2 can be attributed to the substitution of carbon at boron site in\nparent MgB2 and the resulting impact on the carrier density and impurity\nscattering.
