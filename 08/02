Follow-up observations at\nintermediate spectral resolution reveal that the metal lines associated with\nthis 'proximate' DLA consist of two sets of absorption components. One set is\nmoving towards the quasar with velocities of ~ 150-600 km/s; this gas is highly\nionized and does not fully cover the continuum source, suggesting that it is\nphysically close to the active nucleus. The other, which accounts for most of\nthe neutral gas, is blueshifted relative to the QSO, with the strongest\ncomponent at ~ -160 km/s. We consider the possibility that the PDLA arises in\nthe outflowing interstellar medium of the host galaxy of Q2343-BX415, an\ninterpretation supported by strong C IV and N V absorption at nearby\nvelocities, and by the intense radiation field longward of the Lyman limit\nimplied by the high C II*/H I ratio. If Q2343-BX415 is the main source of these\nUV photons, then the PDLA is located at either ~ 8 or ~ 37 kpc from the active\nnucleus. Alternatively, the absorber may be a foreground star-forming galaxy\nunrelated to the quasar and coincidentally at the same redshift, but our deep\nimaging and follow-up spectroscopy of the field of Q2343-BX415 has not yet\nproduced a likely candidate. We measure the abundances of 14 elements in the\nPDLA, finding an overall metallicity of ~ 1/5 solar and a normal pattern of\nrelative element abundances for this metallicity.

The\ndc squid-like geometry leads to an almost complete periodic modulation of the\ncritical current through the device by a magnetic flux, with a flux periodicity\nof a flux quantum h/2e through the SNS loop. In addition, we examine the entire\nfield dependence, notably the low and high field dependence of the maximum\nswitching current.

Substantial pulse shape variability, both stochastic and systematic,\nwas observed during each outburst.

The overall\npulse shape variability limits the ability to measure spin frequency evolution\nwithin a given X-ray outburst (and calls previous nudot measurements of this\nsource into question), with typical upper limits of |nudot| < 2.5x10^{-14} Hz/s\n(2 sigma).

Instead, we identify three distinct phases of\nevolution: a mass transfer turn-on phase (during which the orbital period\ncontinues to decrease even after contact, the donor contracts, and the mass\ntransfer rate accelerates to its maximum), a phase in which the donor expands\nadiabatically in response to mass loss, and a cooling phase beginning at\norbital periods of approximately 45--55 minutes during which the donor\ncontracts. The physics that determines the behaviour in the first and third\nphases, both of which are new outcomes of this study, are discussed in some\ndetail.

Local Kalman filters are implemented on the\n($n_l-$dimensional, where $n_l\\ll n$) sub-systems that are obtained after\nspatially decomposing the large-scale system. The resulting sub-systems\noverlap, which along with an assimilation procedure on the local Kalman\nfilters, preserve an $L$th order Gauss-Markovian structure of the centralized\nerror processes. The information loss due to the $L$th order Gauss-Markovian\napproximation is controllable as it can be characterized by a divergence that\ndecreases as $L\\uparrow$. The order of the approximation, $L$, leads to a lower\nbound on the dimension of the sub-systems, hence, providing a criterion for\nsub-system selection. The assimilation procedure is carried out on the local\nerror covariances with a distributed iterate collapse inversion (DICI)\nalgorithm that we introduce. The DICI algorithm computes the (approximated)\ncentralized Riccati and Lyapunov equations iteratively with only local\ncommunication and low-order computation. We fuse the observations that are\ncommon among the local Kalman filters using bipartite fusion graphs and\nconsensus averaging algorithms.

If the orbital parameters of discovered transiting\nplanets are known, as from follow-up radial velocity observations, then the\ntransit-detected planet population is easily debiased of this effect. The\nduration of a planet's transit depends upon of its eccentricity and longitude\nof periastron; transits near periastron are shorter, and those near apoastron\nlast longer, for a given impact parameter. If fitting for the stellar radius\nwith the other transit parameters, this effect causes a systematic error in the\nresulting measurements. If the stellar radius is instead held fixed at a value\nmeasured independently, then it is possible to place a lower limit on the\nplanet's eccentricity using photometry alone. Orbital accelerations cause a\ndifference in the planet's ingress and egress durations that lead to an\nasymmetry in the transit lightcurve that could be used along with the transit\nvelocity measurement to uniquely measure the planet's eccentricity and\nlongitude of periapsis. However, the effect is too small to be measured with\ncurrent technology. The habitability of transiting terrestrial planets found by\nKepler depends on those planets' orbital eccentricities. While Kepler will be\nable to place lower limits on those planets' orbital eccentricity, the actual\nvalue for any given planet will likely remain unknown.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2007 23:30:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Here we give an explicit demonstration for very\nrestricted metric forms of (Schwarzschild and Kerr) vacuum black holes. In the\nKerr-Schild coordinate expression for these spacetimes they have an explicit\nLorentz-invariant form. We consider {\\it boosted} versions with the black hole\nmoving through the coordinate system. Since these are stationary black hole\nspacetimes, the apparent horizons are two dimensional cross sections of their\nevent horizons, so we compute the areas of apparent horizons in the boosted\nspace with (boosted) $ t = constant $, and obtain the same result as in the\nunboosted case. Note that while the invariance of area is generic, we deal only\nwith black holes in the Kerr-Schild form, and consider only one particularly\nsimple change of slicing which amounts to a boost. Even with these restrictions\nwe find that the results illuminate the physics of the horizon as a null\nsurface and provide a useful pedagogical tool. As far as we can determine, this\nis the first explicit calculation of this type demonstrating the area\ninvariance of horizons.

Most orbit their host stars with larger eccentricities and smaller\nsemi-major axes than similarly sized planets in our own solar system do. It is\ngenerally agreed that the interaction between giant planets and circumstellar\ndisks (Type II migration) drives these planets inward to small radii, but the\neffect of these same disks on orbital eccentricity, e, is controversial.\nSeveral recent analytic calculations suggest that disk-planet interactions can\nexcite eccentricity, while numerical studies generally produce eccentricity\ndamping. This paper addresses this controversy using a quasi-analytic approach,\ndrawing on several preceding analytic studies. This work refines the current\ntreatment of eccentricity evolution by removing several approximations from the\ncalculation of disk torques. We encounter neither uniform damping nor uniform\nexcitation of orbital eccentricity, but rather a function de/dt that varies in\nboth sign and magnitude depending on eccentricity and other solar system\nproperties. Most significantly, we find that for every combination of disk and\nplanet properties investigated herein, corotation torques produce negative\nvalues of de/dt for some range in e within the interval [0.1, 0.5]. If\ncorotation torques are saturated, this region of eccentricity damping\ndisappears, and excitation occurs on a short timescale of less than 0.08 Myr.\nThus, our study does not produce eccentricity excitation on a timescale of a\nfew Myr -- we obtain either eccentricity excitation on a short time scale, or\neccentricity damping on a longer time scale.

We obtain a\ngood agreement with experiment for different observables measured between 40\nand 80 MeV per nucleon. A simple 7Be-p potential model description of 8B seems\nsufficient to describe all observables. In particular, the asymmetry in\nparallel-momentum distributions due to E1-E2 interferences is well reproduced\nwithout any scaling. The projectile-target nuclear interactions seem negligible\nif data are selected at forward angles. On the contrary, like in previous\nanalyzes we observe a significant influence of higher-order effects. The\naccuracy of astrophysical S factors for the 7Be(p,gamma)8B reaction at stellar\nenergies extracted from breakup measurements therefore seems difficult to\nevaluate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2007 14:46:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The statistical properties of frequency distribution\nand the cumulative distribution of the interoccurrence time are discussed by\ntuning the dynamical parameters, namely, a stiffness and frictional property of\na fault. We optimize these model parameters to reproduce the interoccurrence\ntime statistics in nature; the frequency and cumulative distribution can be\ndescribed by the power law and Zipf-Mandelbrot type power law, respectively. In\nan optimal case, the b-value of the Gutenberg-Richter law and the ratio of wave\npropagation velocity are in agreement with those derived from real earthquakes.\nAs the threshold of magnitude is increased, the interoccurrence time\ndistribution tends to follow an exponential distribution.
