We found rapid spectral softening during both the prompt tail phase\nand the decline phase of an X-ray flare in the BAT and XRT data. The observed\nspectra were fit by power-law photon indices which rapidly changed from $\\Gamma\n= 1.51^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ to $\\Gamma = 5.30^{+0.69}_{-0.59}$ within a few hundred\nseconds in the prompt tail. This is one of the steepest X-ray spectra ever\nobserved, making it quite difficult to explain by simple electron acceleration\nand synchrotron radiation. Then, we applied an alternative spectral fitting\nusing a broken power-law with exponential cutoff (BPEC) model. It is valid to\nconsider the situation that the cutoff energy is equivalent to the synchrotron\nfrequency of the maximum energy electrons in their energy distribution. Since\nthe spectral cutoff appears in the soft X-ray band, we conclude the electron\nacceleration has been inefficient in the internal shocks of GRB 060904A. These\ncutoff spectra suddenly disappeared at the transition time from the prompt tail\nphase to the shallow decay one. After that, typical afterglow spectra with the\nphoton indices of 2.0 are continuously and preciously monitored by both XRT and\nSuzaku/XIS up to 1 day since the burst trigger time. We could successfully\ntrace the temporal history of two characteristic break energies (peak energy\nand cutoff energy) and they show the time dependence of $\\propto t^{-3} \\sim\nt^{-4}$ while the following afterglow spectra are quite stable. This fact\nindicates that the emitting material of prompt tail is due to completely\ndifferent dynamics from the shallow decay component. Therefore we conclude the\nemission sites of two distinct phenomena obviously differ from each other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2007 16:32:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-22"}

It reduces to an exact solution of the Lindblad master\nequation if the hamiltonian operator is a quadratic function and the Lindblad\noperators are linear functions of positions and momenta.\n  Initially, the semiclassical formulae for the case of hermitian Lindblad\noperators are reinterpreted in terms of a (real) double phase space, generated\nby an appropriate classical double Hamiltonian. An extra \"open\" term is added\nto the double Hamiltonian by the non-hermitian part of the Lindblad operators\nin the general case of dissipative markovian evolution.

The models are based on\nsystems of linearly coupled 2D Gross-Pitaevskii equations (GPEs), where the\ncoupling accounts for tunneling between the wells. Each well carries an optical\nlattice (OL) (stable 2D solitons cannot exist without OLs). The main subject of\nthe work is spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in two-component 2D solitons\nand localized vortices. We demonstrate that, in the system with attraction or\nrepulsion, SSB occurs in families of symmetric or antisymmetric solitons (or\nvortices), respectively. The corresponding bifurcation destabilizes the\noriginal solution branch and gives rise to a stable branch of asymmetric\nsolitons or vortices. In the model with attraction, all stable branches\neventually terminate due to the onset of collapse. Stable asymmetric solitons\nin higher finite bandgaps, and vortices with a multiple topological charge are\nfound too.

This work is an extension of\nthe earlier work presented by Proga, where nonrotating flows were studied.\nHere, we consider effects of rotation, a position-dependent radiation\ntemperature, density at large radii, and uniform X-ray background radiation. As\nin the non-rotating case, the rotating flow settles into a configuration with\ntwo components (1) an equatorial inflow and (2) a bipolar inflow/outflow with\nthe outflow leaving the system along the pole. However, with rotation the flow\ndoes not always reach a steady state. In addition, rotation reduces the outflow\ncollimation and the outward flux of mass and kinetic energy. Moreover rotation\nincreases the outward flux of the thermal energy and can lead to fragmentation\nand time-variability of the outflow. We also show that a position-dependent\nradiation temperature can significantly change the flow solution. In\nparticular, the inflow in the equatorial region can be replaced by a thermally\ndriven outflow.

Our goal is twofold: to\ndetermine the spatial distribution of dust depending on grain size and planet\nmass, and therefore to provide a framework for interpretation of coming\nobservations and future studies of planetesimal growth. Method: We numerically\nmodel the evolution of dust in a protoplanetary disk using a two-fluid (gas +\ndust) Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code, which is non-self-gravitating\nand locally isothermal. The code follows the three dimensional distribution of\ndust in a protoplanetary disk as it interacts with the gas via aerodynamic\ndrag. In this work, we present the evolution of a minimum mass solar nebula\n(MMSN) disk comprising 1% dust by mass in the presence of an embedded planet.\nWe run a series of simulations which vary the grain size and planetary mass to\nsee how they affect the resulting disk structure. Results: We find that gap\nformation is much more rapid and striking in the dust layer than in the gaseous\ndisk and that a system with a given stellar, disk and planetary mass will have\na completely different appearance depending on the grain size. For low mass\nplanets in our MMSN disk, a gap can open in the dust disk while not in the gas\ndisk.

Galaxy morphology is found to depend critically on the local\nenvironment set up by the nearest neighbor galaxy in addition to luminosity and\nthe large scale density. When a galaxy is located farther than the virial\nradius from its closest neighbor, the probability for the galaxy to have an\nearly morphological type is an increasing function only of luminosity and the\nlocal density due to the nearest neighbor ($\\rho_n$). The tide produced by the\nnearest neighbor is thought to be responsible for the morphology transformation\ntoward the early type at these separations. When the separation is less than\nthe virial radius, i.e. when $\\rho_n > \\rho_{\\rm virial}$, its morphology\ndepends also on the neighbor's morphology and the large-scale background\ndensity over a few Mpc scales ($\\rho_{20}$) in addition to luminosity and\n$\\rho_n$. The early type probability keeps increasing as $\\rho_n$ increases if\nits neighbor is an early type. But the probability decreases as $\\rho_n$\nincreases when the neighbor is a late type. The cold gas streaming from the\nlate type neighbor can be the reason for the morphology transformation toward\nlate type. The overall early-type fraction increases as $\\rho_{20}$ increases\nwhen $\\rho_n > \\rho_{\\rm virial}$. This can be attributed to the hot halo gas\nof the neighbor which is confined by the pressure of the ambient medium held by\nthe background mass. We have also found that galaxy luminosity depends on\n$\\rho_n$, and that the isolated bright galaxies are more likely to be recent\nmerger products.

In this paper, we deal with the spectrophotometric\ncalibration of infrared (IR) spectrometers onboard satellites in the 2 to 200\nmicron range.

The emphasis is on the reference SEDs of\nstellar standards with spectral type later than A0, with special focus on the\ntheoretical model atmosphere spectra. Using the MARCS model atmosphere code,\nspectral reference SEDs were constructed for a set of IR stellar standards (A\ndwarfs, solar analogs, G9-M0 giants). A detailed error analysis was performed\nto estimate proper uncertainties on the predicted flux values. It is shown that\nthe uncertainty on the predicted fluxes can be as high as 10%, but in case\nhigh-resolution observational optical or near-IR data are available, and IR\nexcess can be excluded, the uncertainty on medium-resolution SEDs can be\nreduced to 1-2% in the near-IR, to ~3% in the mid-IR, and to ~5% in the far-IR.\nMoreover, it is argued that theoretical stellar atmosphere spectra are at the\nmoment the best representations for the IR fluxes of cool stellar standards.\nWhen aiming at a determination of the spectrophotometric calibration of IR\nspectrometers better than 3%, effort should be put into constructing an\nappropriate set of stellar reference SEDs based on theoretical atmosphere\nspectra for some 15 standard stars with spectral types between A0V and M0III.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2007 10:09:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We show that a data vector of the two-point correlation\nfunction (2PCF) in general contains more information on cosmological parameters\ncompared to a data vector of the aperture mass dispersion. Reason for this is\nthe fact that <M_ap^2> lacks the information of the convergence power spectrum\n(P_\\kappa) on large angular scales, which is contained in the 2PCF data vector.\nTherefore we create a combined data vector N, which retains the advantages of\n<M_ap^2> and in addition is also sensitive to the large-scale information of\nP_\\kappa.

We find no systematic trend in the velocities of\nthe stars over the observed field of view and conclude that the stellar\nkinematics is governed by random motions. This is in contrast to the motions\nthe ionised interstellar medium, where we find spatial velocity variations up\nto 60 km/s. Our gas velocity field is consistent with previous studies of both\nthe molecular gas and the feedback-driven outflow in He 2-10. We interpret the\nkinematic decoupling between the stars and the gas as He 2-10 being in the\nprocess of transformation to a dwarf elliptical galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2007 14:47:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

As a consequence, the bubbles' `epoch of\noverlap' happens earlier than in LCDM. Finally, we show how the different\nevolution of the HII regions affects the transmission of the high-z QSO\nspectra, reducing the Lyman flux absorption at small optical depths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2007 13:09:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2008 11:56:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-03-25"}

This can be interpreted as a\ncoexistence of different social norms, a result that goes beyond previous\ninvestigations. The model is discrete in time and space, behavior is\ncharacterized in a continuous state space. The adaptation of social behavior by\neach agent is based on attractive and repulsive forces caused by friendly and\nadversary relations among agents. The model is analyzed both analytically and\nby means of spatio-temporal computer simulations. It provides conditions under\nwhich we find convergence towards a single norm, coexistence of two opposing\nnorms, and coexistence of a multitude of norms.

Efficiency refers to weak-form efficient\nmarket hypothesis (EMH) in terms of the information of past price changes. The\nprediction power corresponds to the hit-rate, which is the rate of the\nconsistency between the direction of actual price change and that of predicted\none, calculated by the nearest neighbor prediction method (NN method) using the\nout-of-sample. In this manuscript, the Hurst exponent and the approximate\nentropy (ApEn) are used as the quantitative measurements of the degree of\nefficiency. The relationship between the Hurst exponent, reflecting the various\ntime correlation property, and the ApEn value, reflecting the randomness in the\ntime series, shows negative correlation. However, the average prediction power\non the direction of future price change has the strongly positive correlation\nwith the Hurst exponent, and the negative correlation with the ApEn. Therefore,\nthe market index with less market efficiency has higher prediction power for\nfuture price change than one with higher market efficiency when we analyze the\nmarket using the past price change pattern. Furthermore, we show that the Hurst\nexponent, a measurement of the long-term memory property, provides more\nsignificant information in terms of prediction of future price changes than the\nApEn and the NN method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2007 15:31:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
