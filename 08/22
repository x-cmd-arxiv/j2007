On\nsolving this, we find that the ground-state mode shows the observed\ncharacteristics of the lopsidedness in a galactic disc, namely the fractional\nFourier amplitude A$_1$ increases smoothly with the radius. These lopsided\npatterns precess in the disc with a very slow pattern speed with no preferred\nsense of precession.

The models are based on the minimization of a free\nenergy functional, which is constructed phenomenologically rather than being\nderived from first principles. In single-component systems the free energy is a\nfunctional of a ``phase field'', which is an order parameter often referred to\nas the crystallinity in the context of grain boundaries, but with no precise\ndefinition as to what that term means physically. We present a derivation of\nthe phase field model by Allen and Cahn from classical density functional\ntheory first for crystal-liquid interfaces and then for grain boundaries. The\nderivation provides a clear physical interpretation of the phase field, and it\nsheds light on the parameters and the underlying approximations and limitations\nof the theory. We suggest how phase field models may be improved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2007 16:59:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We\nassume that this extra-mixing originates in a stellar dynamo operated by the\ndifferential rotation below the envelope, maintaining toroidal magnetic fields\nnear the hydrogen-burning shell. We use a phenomenological approach to the\nbuoyancy of magnetic flux tubes, assuming that they induce matter circulation\nas needed by CBP models. This establishes requirements on the fields necessary\nto transport material from zones where some nuclear burning takes place,\nthrough the radiative layer, and into the convective envelope. Magnetic field\nstrengths are determined by the transport rates needed by CBP for the model\nstellar structure of a star of initially 1.5 solar mass, in both the AGB and\nRGB phases. The field required for the AGB star in the processing zone is B_0 ~\n5x10^6 G; at the base of the convective envelope this yields an intensity B_E <\n10^4 G (approximately). For the RGB case, B_0 ~ 5x10^4 to 4x10^5 G, and the\ncorresponding B_E are ~ 450 to 3500 G. These results are consistent with\nexisting observations on AGB stars.

However, some recent studies have\nindicated that the energy deposition rate by neutrino annihilation is somewhat\nsmaller than that needed to power a GRB. To overcome this difficulty,\nRamirez-Ruiz & Socrates (2005) proposed that high energy neutrinos from hot\ncorona above the accretion disk might enhance the efficiency of energy\ndeposition. We elucidate the disk corona model in the context of hypercritical\naccretion flows. From the energy balance in the disk and the corona, we can\ncalculate the disk and coronal temperature, Td and Tc, and neutrino spectra,\ntaking into account the neutrino cooling processes by neutrino-electron\nscatterings and neutrino pair productions. The calculated neutrino spectra\nconsist of two peaks; one by the neutrino emission from the disk and the other\nby that from the corona. We find that the disk corona can enhance the\nefficiency of energy release but only by a factor of 1.5 or so, unless the\nheight of the corona is very small, H<<r.

A relay network with N relays and a single\nsource-destination pair is called a partially-coherent relay channel (PCRC) if\nthe destination has perfect channel state information (CSI) of all the channels\nand the relays have only the phase information of the source-to-relay channels.\nIn this paper, first, a new set of necessary and sufficient conditions for a\nSTBC to be SSD for co-located multiple antenna communication is obtained. Then,\nthis is extended to a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for a\ndistributed STBC (DSTBC) to be SSD for a PCRC, by identifying the additional\nconditions. Using this, several SSD DSTBCs for PCRC are identified among the\nknown classes of STBCs. It is proved that even if a SSD STBC for a co-located\nMIMO channel does not satisfy the additional conditions for the code to be SSD\nfor a PCRC, single-symbol decoding of it in a PCRC gives full-diversity and\nonly coding gain is lost. It is shown that when a DSTBC is SSD for a PCRC, then\narbitrary coordinate interleaving of the in-phase and quadrature-phase\ncomponents of the variables does not disturb its SSD property for PCRC.\nFinally, it is shown that the possibility of {\\em channel phase compensation}\noperation at the relay nodes using partial CSI at the relays increases the\npossible rate of SSD DSTBCs from $\\frac{2}{N}$ when the relays do not have CSI\nto 1/2, which is independent of N.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2007 13:58:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Nov 2008 04:34:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-29"}

We also want to determine physical quantities through the modeling of\nthe object's broad-band spectral energy distribution (SED). Methods: VHE\nobservations (~25h live time) of the BL Lac 1ES 0347-121 (redshift z=0.188)\nwere conducted with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) between\nAugust and December 2006. Contemporaneous X-ray and UV/optical observations\nfrom the SWIFT satellite are used to interpret the SED of the source in terms\nof a synchrotron self Compton (SSC) model. Results: An excess of 327 events,\ncorresponding to a statistical significance of 10.1 standard deviations, is\ndetected from 1ES 0347-121. Its photon spectrum, ranging from ~250GeV to ~3TeV,\nis well described by a power law with a photon index of Gamma = 3.10 +/-\n0.23_stat +/- 0.10_sys. The integral flux above 250GeV corresponds to ~2% of\nthe flux of the Crab Nebula above the same threshold. No VHE flux variability\nis detected within the data set. Conclusions: Constraints on the EBL density at\noptical to near-infrared wavelengths derived from the photon spectrum of 1ES\n0347-121 are close to the strongest limits derived previously. The strong EBL\nlimits confirm earlier findings, that the EBL density in the near-infrared is\nclose to the lower limits from source counts. This implies that the universe is\nmore transparent to VHE gamma-rays than previously believed. An SSC model\nprovides a reasonable description of the contemporaneous SED.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2007 14:10:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-16"}

At each instant the true\nworldline is assumed to lie tangent to a reference geodesic, called an\nosculating orbit, such that the worldline evolves smoothly from one such\ngeodesic to the next. Because a geodesic is uniquely identified by a set of\nconstant orbital elements, the transition between osculating orbits corresponds\nto an evolution of the elements. In this paper we derive the evolution\nequations for a convenient set of orbital elements, assuming that the force\nacts only within the orbital plane; this is the only restriction that we impose\non the formalism, and we do not assume that the force must be small. As an\napplication of our method, we analyze the relative motion of two massive\nbodies, assuming that one body is much smaller than the other. Using the hybrid\nSchwarzschild/post-Newtonian equations of motion formulated by Kidder, Will,\nand Wiseman, we treat the unperturbed motion as geodesic in a Schwarzschild\nspacetime whose mass parameter is equal to the system's total mass. The force\nthen consists of terms that depend on the system's reduced mass. We highlight\nthe importance of conservative terms in this force, which cause significant\nlong-term changes in the time-dependence and phase of the relative orbit. From\nour results we infer some general limitations of the radiative approximation to\nthe gravitational self-force, which uses only the dissipative terms in the\nforce.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2007 15:11:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2007 20:45:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
