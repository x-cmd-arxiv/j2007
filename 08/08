The redshift becomes\nsingular as the particle separation decreases. The response weakens for very\nsmall separation when the coupling across the interparticle gap becomes so\nstrong that dipolar oscillations across the pair are inhibited.\nLower-wavelength, higher-order modes show a similar separation dependence in\nnearly touching dimers. After touching, singular behavior is observed through\nthe emergence of a new infrared absorption peak, also accompanied by huge\ncharge pileup at the interparticle junction, if initial interparticle-contact\nis made at a single point.

Roughly\nspeaking, it is the property that the total number of jobs in the network\nremains bounded as a function of time. One of the key questions related to the\nstability issue is how to determine the exact conditions under which a given\nqueueing network operating under a given scheduling policy remains stable.\nWhile there was much initial progress in addressing this question, most of the\nresults obtained were partial at best and so the complete characterization of\nstable queueing networks is still lacking. In this paper, we resolve this open\nproblem, albeit in a somewhat unexpected way. We show that characterizing\nstable queueing networks is an algorithmically undecidable problem for the case\nof nonpreemptive static buffer priority scheduling policies and deterministic\ninterarrival and service times. Thus, no constructive characterization of\nstable queueing networks operating under this class of policies is possible.\nThe result is established for queueing networks with finite and infinite buffer\nsizes and possibly zero service times, although we conjecture that it also\nholds in the case of models with only infinite buffers and nonzero service\ntimes.

This event was discovered by an amateurastronomer, A.\nTago, on 2006 October 31 as a transient brightening, by ~4.5 mag during a ~15\nday period, of a normal A-type star (GSC 3656-1328) in the Cassiopeia\nconstellation. Analysis of both spectroscopic observations and the light curve\nindicates that this event was caused by gravitational microlensing rather than\nan intrinsically variable star. Discovery of this single event over a 30 year\nperiod is roughly consistent with the expected microlensing rate for the whole\nsky down to V = 12 mag stars. However, the probability for finding events with\nsuch a high magnification (~ 50) is much smaller, by a factor ~1/50, which\nimplies that the true event rate may be higher than expected.

By\ncomparing the numerical results to a simple diffusion model, we are able to\ndetermine the diffusion coefficient of the warp, $\\alpha_2$, as a function of\nthe relevant disc parameters. We find that while in general the disc behaviour\nis well reproduced by the diffusion model and for relatively large viscosities\nthe warp diffusion is well described by the linear theory (in particular\nconfirming that the warp diffusion coefficient is inversely proportional to\nviscosity), significant non-linear effects are present as the viscosity becomes\nsmaller, but still dominates over wave-propagation effects. In particular, we\nfind that the inverse dependence of the diffusion coefficient on viscosity\nbreaks down at low viscosities, so that $\\alpha_2$ never becomes larger than a\nsaturation value $\\alpha_{\\rm max}$ of order unity. This can have major\nconsequences in the evolution of systems where a warped disc is present. In\nparticular, it affects the location of the warp radius in the Bardeen-Petterson\neffect and therefore the spin up (or spin down) of supermassive black holes in\nthe nuclei of galaxies.

The self-consistent Born approximation was\nused to model the self-energies. Its validity was checked by comparison with\nthe results obtained by direct diagonalization of the Hamiltonian of\ninteracting electrons and longitudinal optical phonons. The nature of charge\ntransport at electron -- phonon resonances was investigated in detail and\ncontributions from scattering and coherent tunnelling to the current were\nidentified. It was found that at larger values of the structure period the main\npeak in the current -- field characteristics exhibits a doublet structure which\nwas shown to be a transport signature of polaron effects. At smaller values of\nthe period, electron -- phonon resonances cause multiple peaks in the\ncharacteristics. A phenomenological model for treatment of nonuniformities of a\nrealistic quantum dot ensemble was also introduced to estimate the influence of\nnonuniformities on current -- field characteristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2007 15:44:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2008 02:27:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We measure the current in\nthese devices as a function of source-drain voltage, gate voltage and\ntemperature. Annealing is necessary to observe measurable current after which a\nsimple model of hopping between intrinsic localized states describes the\ntransport properties of the nanocrystal solid. We find that the majority\ncarriers are holes, which are thermally released from acceptor states. At low\nsource-drain voltages, the activation energy for the conductivity is given by\nthe energy required to generate holes plus the activation over barriers\nresulting from site disorder. At high source-drain voltages the activation\nenergy is given by the former only. The thermal activation energy of the\nzero-bias conductance indicates that the Fermi energy is close to the\nhighest-occupied valence level, the 1Sh state, and this is confirmed by\nfield-effect measurements, which give a density of states of approximately\neight per nanocrystal as expected from the degeneracy of the 1Sh state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2007 15:39:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2008 21:32:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-28"}
