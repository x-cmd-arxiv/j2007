The parameter $M$ is considered as a new\nuniversal physical constant of Nature and therefore is called the fundamental\nmass. It is introduced in a purely geometrical way, like the velocity of light\nas a maximal velocity in the special relativity. If one chooses the Euclidean\nformulation of quantum field theory, the adequate realization of the limiting\nmass hypothesis is reduced to the choice of the de Sitter geometry as the\ngeometry of the 4-momentum space. All fields, defined in de Sitter p-space in\nconfigurational space obey five dimensional Klein-Gordon type equation with\nfundamental mass $M$ as a mass parameter. The role of dynamical field variables\nis played by the Cauchy initial conditions given at $x_5 = 0$, guarantying the\nlocality and gauge invariance principles. The corresponding to the geometrical\nrequirements formulation of the theory of scalar, vector and spinor fields is\nconsidered in some detail. On a simple example it is demonstrated that the\nspontaneously symmetry breaking mechanism leads to renormalization of the\nfundamental mass $M$. A new geometrical concept of the chirality of the fermion\nfields is introduced. It would be responsible for new measurable effects at\nhigh energies $E \\geq M$.

A\nknowledge of the hard X-ray bolometric correction, \\kappa_{2-10keV} is a vital\ninput into these studies. Variations in the disk emission in the UV have not\npreviously been taken into account in calculating \\kappa_{2-10keV}; we show\nthat such variations are important by constructing optical--to--X-ray SEDs for\n54 AGN. In particular, we use FUSE UV and X-ray data from the literature to\nconstrain the disk emission as well as possible. Previous work has suggested a\ndependence of \\kappa_{2-10keV} on AGN luminosity, but we find significant\nspread in \\kappa_{2-10keV} with no simple dependence on luminosity. Populations\nsuch as Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 nuclei (NLS1s), Radio Loud and X-ray Weak AGN may\nhave values of \\kappa_{2-10keV} differing systematically from the rest of the\nAGN population.

Our results suggest a more well-defined relationship between\n\\kappa_{2-10keV} and Eddington ratio in AGN, with a transitional region at an\nEddington ratio of ~0.1, below which the bolometric correction is typically 15\n- 25, and above which it is typically 40 - 70. We consider the potential\nimplied parallels with the low/hard and high/soft states in Galactic Black Hole\n(GBH) accretion, and present bolometric corrections for the GBH binary GX 339-4\nfor comparison. Our findings reinforce previous studies proposing a multi-state\ndescription of AGN accretion analogous to that for GBH binaries.

Methods: We have developed detailed\nsimulations of stellar spots and estimated their effects on a number of\nobservables commonly used in the analysis of radial-velocity data when looking\nfor extrasolar planets, such as radial-velocity curves, cross-correlation\nfunctions, bisector spans and photometric curves. The computed stellar spectra\nare then analyzed in the same way as when searching for exoplanets. Results: 1)\nA first grid of simulation results is built for F-K type stars, with different\nstellar and spot properties. 2) It is shown quantitatively that star spots with\ntypical sizes of 1% can mimic both radial-velocity curves and the bisector\nbehavior of short-period giant planets around G-K type stars with a vsini lower\nthan the spectrograph resolution. For stars with intermediate vsini, smaller\nspots may produce similar features. In these cases, additional observables\n(e.g., photometry, spectroscopic diagnostics) are mandatory to confirm the\npresence of short-period planets. We show that, in some cases, photometric\nvariations may not be enough to clearly rule out spots as explanations of the\nobserved radial-velocity variations. This is particularly important when\nsearching for super-Earth planets. 3) It is also stressed that quantitative\nvalues obtained for radial-velocity and bisector span amplitudes depend\nstrongly on the detailed star properties, on the spectrograph used, on the set\nof lines used, and on the way they are measured.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2007 13:25:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We follow the evolution of the RBW as it sweeps up circumstellar\nmatter and assume that the swept-up electrons and protons have energies equal\nto the Lorentz factor of the flow. While the electrons radiate their energies\nthrough synchrotron and inverse Compton radiation on short timescales, the\nprotons, at least initially, start accumulating without any dissipation. As the\naccumulated mass of relativistic protons increases, however, they can become\nsupercritical to the `proton-photon pair-production - synchrotron radiation'\nnetwork, and, as a consequence, they transfer explosively their stored energy\nto secondary electron-positron pairs and radiation. This results in a burst\nwhich has many features similar to the ones observed in GRB prompt emission.

Such processes are of great\nimportance for the understanding of relaxation in single molecule devices. As a\ndetailed case study, we investigate here a generic spin-fermion model, where a\ntwo-level system couples to two metallic leads with different chemical\npotentials. We present results for the spin relaxation rate in the nonadiabatic\nlimit for an arbitrary coupling to the leads, using both analytical and exact\nnumerical methods. The non-equilibrium dynamics is reflected by an exponential\nrelaxation at long times and via complex phase shifts, leading in some cases to\nan \"anti-orthogonality\" effect. In the limit of strong system-lead coupling at\nzero temperature we demonstrate the onset of a Marcus-like Gaussian decay with\n{\\it voltage difference} activation. This is analogous to the equilibrium\nspin-boson model, where at strong coupling and high temperatures the spin\nexcitation rate manifests temperature activated Gaussian behavior. We find that\nthere is no simple linear relationship between the role of the temperature in\nthe bosonic system and a voltage drop in a non-equilibrium electronic case. The\ntwo models also differ by the orthogonality-catastrophe factor existing in a\nfermionic system, which modifies the resulting lineshapes. Implications for\ncurrent characteristics are discussed. We demonstrate the violation of\npair-wise Coulomb gas behavior for strong coupling to the leads. The results\npresented in this paper form the basis of an exact, non-perturbative\ndescription of steady-state quantum dissipative systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2007 15:27:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
