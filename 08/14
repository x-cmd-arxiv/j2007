This problem is particularly\ncomplicated if the radiation fields have higher energy density than the\nmagnetic field and are sufficiently energetic that inverse Compton scattering\nis not limited to the Thomson regime. We present a simple, time-dependent,\nsemi-analytical solution of the electron kinetic equation that treats both\ncontinuous and impulsive injection, cooling via synchrotron and inverse Compton\nradiation, (taking into account Klein-Nishina effects) and energy dependent\nparticle escape. The kinetic equation for an arbitrary, time-dependent source\nfunction is solved by the method of Laplace transformations. Using an\napproximate expression for the energy loss rate that takes into account\nsynchrotron and inverse Compton losses including Klein-Nishina effects for\nscattering off an isotropic photon field with either a power-law or black-body\ndistribution, we find explicit expressions for the cooling time and escape\nprobability of individual electrons. This enables the full, time-dependent\nsolution to be reduced to a single quadrature. From the electron distribution,\nwe then construct the time-dependent, multi-wavelength emission spectrum. We\ncompare our solutions with several limiting cases and discuss the general\nappearance and temporal behaviour of spectral features (i.e., cooling breaks,\nbumps etc.). As a specific example, we model the broad-band energy spectrum of\nthe open stellar association Westerlund-2 at different times of its evolution,\nand compare it with observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2007 18:11:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Specifically, students' attitudes towards the value\nof physics and its applicability to the real-world were probed using a\n26-question Likert scale survey over the course of four semesters in an\nintroductory physics course at a comprehensive Jesuit university. We found that\nstudents who did not participate in the blog study generally exhibited a\ndeterioration in attitude towards physics as seen previously.

However, the interpretation of these spectra is\ncomplicated by the fact that the Ly-alpha optical depth is already large for\nneutral hydrogen fractions in excess of 10^-4, and also because quasars are\nexpected to reside in dense regions of the IGM. We present a model for the\nevolution of the ionization state of the IGM which is applicable to the dense,\nbiased regions around high-redshift quasars as well as more typical regions in\nthe IGM, and combine this with numerical radiative transfer simulations. Our\nmodel is able to simultaneously reproduce the observed Ly-alpha forest opacity\nat 4<z<6, the ionizing photon mean-free-path at z~4 and the rapid evolution of\nhighly ionized near-zone sizes around high-redshift quasars at 5.8<z<6.4. We\nfind that within 5 physical Mpc of a high redshift quasar, the evolution of the\nionization state of the IGM precedes that in more typical regions by around 0.3\nredshift units. More importantly, when combined with the rapid increase in the\nionizing photon mean-free-path expected shortly after overlap, this offset\nresults in an ionizing background near the quasar which exceeds the value in\nthe rest of the IGM by a factor of ~2-3. We further find that in the\npost-overlap phase of reionization the size of the observed quasar near-zones\nis not directly sensitive to the neutral hydrogen fraction of the IGM. Instead,\nthese sizes probe the level of the background ionization rate and the\ntemperature of the surrounding IGM. The observed rapid evolution of the quasar\nnear-zone sizes at 5.8<z<6.4 can thus be explained by the rapid evolution of\nthe ionizing background, which in our model is caused by the completion of\noverlap at the end of reionization by 6<z<7.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2007 01:18:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We show the relative importance\nof these three modes to be a strong function of stellar mass and of redshift.\nGalaxy growth through major mergers depends strongly on stellar mass, but only\nweakly on redshift. Except for massive systems, minor mergers contribute more\nto galaxy growth than major mergers at all redshifts and at all stellar masses.\nFor galaxies significantly less massive than the Milky Way, star formation\ndominates the growth at all epochs. For galaxies significantly more massive\nthan the Milky Way, growth through mergers is the dominant process at all\nepochs. At a stellar mass of $6\\times 10^{10}M_\\odot$, star formation dominates\nat $z>1$ and mergers at later times. At every stellar mass, the growth rates\nthrough star formation increase rapidly with increasing redshift. Specific star\nformation rates are a decreasing function of stellar mass not only at $z=0$ but\nalso at all higher redshifts. For comparison, we carry out a similar analysis\nof the growth of dark matter halos. In contrast to the galaxies, growth rates\ndepend strongly on redshift, but only weakly on mass. They agree qualitatively\nwith analytic predictions for halo growth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2007 08:08:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Roughly speaking, there is one model for each {\\em kernel}, i.e., each\nsymmetric measurable function from $[0,1]^2$ to the non-negative reals,\nalthough the details are much more complicated. A different connection between\nkernels and random graphs arises in the recent work of Borgs, Chayes, Lov\\'asz,\nS\\'os, Szegedy and Vesztergombi. They introduced several natural metrics on\ndense graphs (graphs with $n$ vertices and $\\Theta(n^2)$ edges), showed that\nthese metrics are equivalent, and gave a description of the completion of the\nspace of all graphs with respect to any of these metrics in terms of {\\em\ngraphons}, which are essentially bounded kernels. One of the most appealing\naspects of this work is the message that sequences of inhomogeneous\nquasi-random graphs are in a sense completely general: any sequence of dense\ngraphs contains such a subsequence.\n  Our aim here is to briefly survey these results, and then to investigate to\nwhat extent they can be generalized to graphs with $o(n^2)$ edges. Although\nmany of the definitions extend in a simple way, the connections between the\nvarious metrics, and between the metrics and random graph models, turn out to\nbe much more complicated than in the dense case. We shall prove many partial\nresults, and state even more conjectures and open problems, whose resolution\nwould greatly enhance the currently rather unsatisfactory theory of metrics on\nsparse graphs. This paper deals mainly with graphs with $o(n^2)$ but\n$\\omega(n)$ edges: a companion paper [arXiv:0812.2656] will discuss the (more\nproblematic still) case of {\\em extremely sparse} graphs, with O(n) edges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2007 15:54:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 Dec 2008 15:56:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 30 Jan 2009 18:00:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-29"}
