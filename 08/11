For a cold\nscattering outflow, the reflected flux overshines the primary one if the\nscattering outflow is nearly baryon-free and highly relativistic. These two\nrequirements can be relaxed if the scattering outflow is energized by weak\ninternal shocks, so that the incident forward-shock photons are also\ninverse-Compton scattered, in addition to bulk-scattering. Sweeping-up of the\nphotons left behind by the forward shock naturally yields short X-ray flares.\nOwing to the boost in photon energy produced by bulk-scattering scattering, the\nreflected emission is more likely to overshine that coming directly from the\nforward shock at higher photon energies, yielding light-curve plateaus and\nbreaks that appear only in the X-ray.

These observations are part of a program to study the\norigin of magnetic activity in ultracool dwarfs, and its impact on\nchromospheric and coronal emission. Here we detect steady quiescent radio\nemission superposed with multiple short-duration, highly polarized flares;\nthere is no evidence for periodic bursts previously reported for this object,\nindicating their transient nature. We also detect soft X-ray emission, with\nL_X/L_bol~10^-4.9, the faintest to date for any object later than M5, and a\npossible weak X-ray flare. TVLM513-46546 continues the trend of severe\nviolation of the radio/X-ray correlation in ultracool dwarfs, by nearly 4\norders of magnitude. From the optical spectroscopy we find that the Balmer line\nluminosity exceeds the X-ray luminosity by a factor of a few, suggesting that,\nunlike in early M dwarfs, chromospheric heating may not be due to coronal X-ray\nemission. More importantly, we detect a sinusoidal H-alpha light curve with a\nperiod of 2 hr, matching the rotation period of TVLM513-46546. This is the\nfirst known example of such Balmer line behavior, which points to a co-rotating\nchromospheric hot spot or an extended magnetic structure, with a covering\nfraction of about 50%. This feature may be transitory based on the apparent\ndecline in light curve peak during the four observed maxima. From the radio\ndata we infer a large scale steady magnetic field of ~100 G, in good agreement\nwith the value required for confinement of the X-ray emitting plasma. The radio\nflares, on the other hand, are produced in a component of the field with a\nstrength of ~3 kG and a likely multi-polar configuration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2007 20:00:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Overall, the structure of our simulated clusters\ncompares remarkably well to low-redshift observations, although some\ndifferences remain that may point to incomplete gas physics. We find no\ndependence on cluster structure in the mass-observable scaling relations, T_X-M\nand Y_X-M, when using the true cluster masses. However, estimates of the total\nmass based on the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, as assumed in\nobservational studies, are systematically low. We show that the hydrostatic\nmass bias strongly correlates with cluster structure and, more weakly, with\ncluster mass. When the hydrostatic masses are used, the mass-observable scaling\nrelations and gas mass fractions depend significantly on cluster morphology,\nand the true relations are not recovered even if the most relaxed clusters are\nused. We show that cluster structure, via the power ratios, can be used to\neffectively correct the hydrostatic mass estimates and mass-scaling relations,\nsuggesting that we can calibrate for this systematic effect in cosmological\nstudies. Similar to observational studies, we find that cluster structure,\nparticularly centroid shift, evolves with redshift. This evolution is mild but\nwill lead to additional errors at high redshift.
