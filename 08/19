In the model, the processive nucleotide\naddition is implemented on the basis of two requirements: One is that stem IV\nloop stimulates the chemical reaction of nucleotide incorporation, and the\nother one is the existence of an ssRNA-binding site adjacent to the polymerase\nsite that has a high affinity for the unpaired base of the template. The\nunpairing of DNA:RNA hybrid after the incorporation of the nucleotide paired\nwith the last base on the template, which is the prerequisite for repeat\naddition processivity, is caused by a force acting on the primer. The force is\nresulted from the unfolding of stem III pseudoknot that is induced by the\nswinging of stem IV loop towards the nucleotide-bound polymerase site. Based on\nthe model, the dynamics of processive nucleotide and repeat additions by\nTetrahymena telomerase are quantitatively studied, which give good explanations\nto the previous experimental results. Moreover, some predictions are presented.\nIn particular, it is predicted that the repeat addition processivity is mainly\ndetermined by the difference between the free energy required to disrupt the\nDNA:RNA hybrid and that required to unfold the stem III pseudoknot, with the\nlarge difference corresponding to a low repeat addition processivity while the\nsmall one corresponding to a high repeat addition processivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Aug 2007 07:36:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-08-21"}

However, most of\nthe fundamental issues for shock reflection have not been understood, including\nthe global structure, stability, and transition of the different patterns of\nshock reflection.
