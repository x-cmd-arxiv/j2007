The brightness temperature of the 21-cm signal is derived by\npost-processing this numerical simulation with a semi-analytical prescription.\nOur study extends to high redshifts (z ~ 25) where, in addition to collisional\ncoupling, our post-processed simulations take into account the inhomogeneities\nin the heating of the neutral gas by X-rays and the effect of an inhomogeneous\nLya radiation field. Unlike the well-studied case where spin temperature is\nassumed to be significantly greater than the temperature of the cosmic\nmicrowave background due to uniform heating of the gas by X-rays, spatial\nfluctuations in both the Lya radiation field and X-ray intensity impact\npredictions related to the brightness temperature at z > 10, during the early\nstages of reionization and gas heating. The statistics of the 21-cm signal from\nour simulation are then compared to existing analytical models in the\nliterature and we find that these analytical models provide a reasonably\naccurate description of the 21-cm power spectrum at z < 10. Such an agreement\nis useful since analytical models are better suited to quickly explore the full\nastrophysical and cosmological parameter space relevant for future 21-cm\nsurveys. We find, nevertheless, non-negligible differences that can be\nattributed to differences in the inhomogeneous X-ray heating and Lya coupling\nat z > 10 and, with upcoming interferometric data, these differences in return\ncan provide a way to better understand the astrophysical processes during\nreionization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2007 16:09:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Aug 2008 23:10:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We derive K-band surface brightness profiles for those\nnuclei for which the morphology allows a meaningful isophotal analysis, and fit\nthe profiles with a ``Nuker law'' for comparison with other samples of galaxies\nobserved with HST. The majority of the nuclei have steep profiles that can be\ncharacterized as power-law type.

Overall, our results are consistent with the generic\npredictions of N-body simulations of spiral galaxy mergers. If left to evolve\nand fade for several Gyrs, it is possible that the properties of the Toomre\nsequence nuclei would resemble theproperties of the nuclei of normal E/S0\ngalaxies.

Within\nthis scenario GRBs are believed to be powered by accretion through a\nrotationally support torus or by fast rotation of a compact object. In both\ncases then, rotation of the progenitor star is one of the key properties\nbecause it must be high enough for the torus to form, the compact object to\nrotate very fast, or both. Here, we check what rotational properties a\nprogenitor star must have in order to sustain torus accretion over relatively\nlong activity periods as observed in most GRBs. We show that simple, often\ncited, estimates of the total mass available for torus formation and\nconsequently the duration of a GRB are only upper limits. We revise these\nestimates by taking into account the long term effect that as the compact\nobject accretes the minimum specific angular momentum needed for torus\nformation increases. This in turn leads to a smaller fraction of the stellar\nenvelope that can form a torus. We demostrate that this effect can lead to a\nsignificant, an order of magnidute, reduction of the total energy and overall\nduration of a GRB event. This of course can be mitigated by assuming that the\nprogenitor star rotates faster then we assumed. However, our assumed rotation\nis already high compared to observational and theoretical constraints.

We first present a\nthorough analytic understanding of the structure of the beam response function\nusing an analytic approach employing the stationary phase approximation. The\ntrue sky map is obtained by numerically deconvolving the beam function in the\nintegral (convolution) equation. We adopt the maximum likelihood framework to\nestimate the true sky map that has been successfully used in the broadly\nsimilar, well-studied CMB map making problem. We numerically implement and\ndemonstrate the method on simulated (unpolarized) SGWB for the radiometer\nconsisting of the LIGO pair of detectors at Hanford and Livingston. We include\n`realistic' additive Gaussian noise in each data stream based on the LIGO-I\nnoise power spectral density. The extension of the method to multiple baselines\nand polarized GWB is outlined. In the near future the network of GW detectors,\nincluding the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors that will be sensitive to\nsources within a thousand times larger spatial volume, could provide promising\ndata sets for GW radiometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2007 20:43:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Jun 2008 07:04:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

The models\ncover the wavelength range 300-1340nm at a resolution of FWHM=1AA, for\nmetallicities in the range 0.005<=Z<=0.048 and stellar population ages 3 to 14\nGyr. These models are based on a recent library of synthetic stellar spectra\nand a new library of stellar evolutionary tracks, both computed for three\ndifferent [Fe/H] (-0.5,0.0 and 0.2) and two different [alpha/Fe] (0.0 and 0.4).\nWe expect our fully synthetic models to be primarily useful for evaluating the\ndifferential effect of changes in the alpha/Fe ratio on spectral properties\nsuch as broad-band colours and narrow spectral features. In addition, we assess\nthe accuracy of absolute model predictions in two ways: first, by comparing the\npredictions of models for scaled-solar metal abundances [alpha/Fe]=0.0) to\nthose of existing models based on libraries of observed stellar spectra; and\nsecondly, by comparing the predictions of models for alpha-enhanced metal\nabundances ([alpha/Fe]=0.4) to observed spectra of massive early-type galaxies\nin the SDSS-DR4. We find that our models predict accurate strengths for those\nspectral indices that are strongly sensitive to the abundances of Fe and alpha\nelements. The predictions are less reliable for the strengths of other spectral\nfeatures, such as those dominated by the abundances of C and N, as expected\nfrom the fact that the models do not yet allow one to explore the influence of\nthese elements in an independent way. We conclude that our models are a\npowerful tool for extracting new information about the chemical properties of\ngalaxies for which high-quality spectra have been gathered by modern surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2007 09:23:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2008 14:07:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-08"}

In contrast, moderate activity characterized the NIR and optical\nlight curves, with a progressive increase of the variability amplitude with\nincreasing wavelength. We ascribe this redder-when-brighter behaviour to the\npresence of a \"little blue bump\" due to line emission from the broad line\nregion, which is clearly visible in the source SED during faint states.\nMoreover, the data from the XMM-Newton OM reveal a rise of the SED in the UV,\nsuggesting the existence of a \"big blue bump\" due to thermal emission from the\naccretion disc. The X-ray spectra are well fitted with a power-law model with\nphotoelectric absorption, possibly larger than the Galactic one.

AIMS: We aim to determine an accurate mass\nfor the compact object through an improved measurement of the secondary star's\nprojected equatorial rotational velocity. METHODS: We have used UVES echelle\nspectroscopy to determine the vsini of the secondary star (V395 Car) in the\nlow-mass X-ray binary 2S0921-630 by comparison to an artificially broadened\nspectral-type template star. In addition, we have also measured vsini from a\nsingle high signal-to-noise ratio absorption line profile calculated using the\nmethod of Least-Squares Deconvolution (LSD). RESULTS: We determine vsini to lie\nbetween 31.3+/-0.5km/s to 34.7+/-0.5km/s (assuming zero and continuum limb\ndarkening, respectively) in disagreement with revious results based on\nintermediate resolution spectroscopy obtained with the 3.6m NTT. Using our\nrevised vsini value in combination with the secondary star's radial velocity\ngives a binary mass ratio of 0.281+/-0.034. Furthermore, assuming a binary\ninclination angle of 75 degrees gives a compact object mass of 1.37+/-0.13Mo.\nCONCLUSIONS: We find that using relatively low-resolution spectroscopy can\nresult in systemic uncertainties in the measured vsini values obtained using\nstandard methods. We suggest the use of LSD as a secondary, reliable check of\nthe results as LSD allows one to directly discern the shape of the absorption\nline profile. In the light of the new vsini measurement, we have revised down\nthe compact object's mass, such that it is now compatible with a canonical\nneutron star mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2007 13:08:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

VIMOS IFU spectroscopy is used to study the morphology, kinematics\nand ionisation state of the EELR surrounding this source, and also a companion\ngalaxy at a similar redshift. Near- and far-IR imaging observations obtained\nusing the NTT and SPITZER are used to analyse the underlying galaxy\nmorphologies and the nature of the AGN. The host galaxy is identified as an ~M*\nelliptical. Combining Spitzer mid-IR with X-ray, optical and near-IR imaging\nobservations of this source, we conclude that its AGN is underluminous for a\nradio source of this type, despite its status as a BLRG. However, given its\nrelatively large [OIII] luminosity it is likely that the AGN was substantially\nmore luminous in the recent past (<10^4 years ago). The EELR is remarkably\nextensive and complex, reminiscent of the systems observed around sources at\nhigher redshifts/radio powers, and the gas is predominantly ionised by a\nmixture of AGN photoionisation and emission from young stars. We confirm the\npresence of a series of star-forming knots extending N-S from the host galaxy,\nwith more prodigious star formation occuring in the merging companion galaxy to\nthe northeast, which has sufficient luminosity at mid- to far-IR wavelengths to\nbe classified as a LIRG. The most plausible explanation of our observations is\nthat PKS1932-46 is a member of an interacting galaxy group, and that the\nimpressive EELR is populated by star-forming, tidal debris. We suggest that the\nAGN itself may currently be fuelled by material associated either with the\ncurrent interaction, or with a previous merger event.

We also investigate the difference\nbetween the versions of Electroweak theory with the gauge groups $SU(2)\\otimes\nU(1)$ and $SU(2)\\otimes U(1)/Z_2$. We do not detect any difference at $\\alpha\n\\sim {1/128}$.

The\ninhomogeneous infinite matter is described in terms of cubic Wigner-Seitz\ncells, which allows for a microscopic description of the structures in the\nso-called ``pasta-phase'' of nuclear configurations and provides a smooth\ntransition to the limit of homogeneous matter.
