In this paper we present a novel\napplication of entanglement by showing that the resolution obtained by an\nimaging system utilizing separable photons can be achieved by an imaging system\nmaking use of entangled photons, but with the advantage of a smaller aperture,\nthus resulting in a smaller and lighter system. This can be especially valuable\nin satellite imaging where weight and size play a vital role.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Aug 2007 20:53:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

For\nlarger bias voltages the current does not vanish any more since further\ntunneling channels participate in the electron conduction and we also observe\nphoton-assisted tunneling which leads to steps in the current-voltage\ncharacteristics. The described phenomena are demonstrated not only for\nmonochromatic fields but also for laser pulses and therefore could be used for\nultrafast optical switching of the current through molecular junctions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Aug 2007 12:05:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

They include as special cases all deficiency\nzero systems and all detailed balancing systems. One feature is that the steady\nstate locus of a toric dynamical system is a toric variety, which has a unique\npoint within each invariant polyhedron. We develop the basic theory of toric\ndynamical systems in the context of computational algebraic geometry and show\nthat the associated moduli space is also a toric variety.
