The star forming galaxies span the\nfull range of sizes, while the quiescent galaxies all have r_e<2kpc. In the\nredshift range where MIPS 24 micron imaging is a sensitive probe of re-radiated\ndust emission (z<2.5), the 24 micron fluxes confirm that the light of the small\nquiescent galaxies is dominated by old stars, rather than dust-enshrouded star\nformation or AGN activity. The inferred surface mass densities and velocity\ndispersions for the quiescent galaxies are very high compared to those in local\ngalaxies. The galaxies follow a Kormendy relation (between surface brightness\nand size) with approximately the same slope as locally, but shifted to brighter\nsurface brightnesses, consistent with a mean stellar formation redshift of\nz_f~5.

We are\ninterested in how quickly can the receiver isolate the sent message,\nparticularly in the regime where A is exponentially larger than the codeword\nlength N, which we refer to as `strong asynchronism.'\n  This model of sparse communication may represent the situation of a sensor\nthat remains idle most of the time and, only occasionally, transmits\ninformation to a remote base station which needs to quickly take action.\n  The first result shows that vanishing error probability can be guaranteed as\nN tends to infinity while A grows as Exp(N*k) if and only if k does not exceed\nthe `synchronization threshold,' a constant that admits a simple closed form\nexpression, and is at least as large as the capacity of the synchronized\nchannel. The second result is the characterization of a set of achievable\nstrictly positive rates in the regime where A is exponential in N, and where\nthe rate is defined with respect to the expected delay between the time\ninformation starts being emitted until the time the receiver makes a decision.\n  As an application of the first result we consider antipodal signaling over a\nGaussian channel and derive a simple necessary condition between A, N, and SNR\nfor achieving reliable communication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2007 18:51:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-08-01"}

In this paper, we assess whether the ellipsoidal\ncollapse model can produce a similar dependence. First, we explore the\nstatistical correlation that originates from Gaussian initial conditions. We\nderive analytic expressions for a number of joint statistics of the shear\ntensor and estimate the sensitivity of the local characteristics of the shear\nto the global geometry of the large scale environment. Next, we concentrate on\nthe dynamical aspect of the environmental dependence using a simplified model\nthat takes into account the interaction between a collapsing halo and its\nenvironment. We find that the tidal force exerted by the surrounding mass\ndistribution causes haloes embedded in overdense regions to virialize earlier.\nAn effective density threshold whose shape depends on the large scale density\nprovides a good description of this environmental effect. We show that, using\nthis approach, a correlation between formation redshift, large scale bias and\nenvironment density naturally arises. The strength of the effect is comparable,\nalbeit smaller, to that seen in simulations. It is largest for low mass haloes\nand decreases as one goes to higher mass objects. Furthermore, haloes that\nformed early are substantially more clustered than those that assembled\nrecently. On the other hand, our analytic model predicts a decrease in median\nformation redshift with increasing environment density, in disagreement with\nthe trend detected in overdense regions.

Shocks develop either as\na result of radiation-driven instabilities or due to confinement of the wind by\nrelatively strong magnetic field, and since they are radiative, a simple model\nof their X-ray emission was developed that allows a direct comparison with\nobservations. According to our model, the shock structures (clumps, complete or\nfractional shells) eventually become `cold' clouds in the X-ray sky of the\nstar.

We determine the system parameters via a\nparameterised model of the eclipse fitted to the observed lightcurve by chi^2\nminimisation. We obtain a mass ratio of q = 0.0623 +/- 0.0007 and an orbital\ninclination i = 83.63 +/- 0.05 degrees. The primary mass is M_w = 0.90 +/- 0.01\nM_sun. The secondary mass and radius are found to be M_r =0.056 +/- 0.001 M_sun\nand R_r = 0.096 +/- 0.001 R_sun respectively. We find a distance to the system\nof 160 +/- 10 pc. The secondary star in SDSS J1507 has a mass substantially\nbelow the hydrogen burning limit, making it the second confirmed sub-stellar\ndonor in a cataclysmic variable.\n  The very short orbital period of SDSS J1507 is readily explained if the\nsecondary star is nuclearly evolved, or if SDSS J1507 formed directly from a\ndetached white dwarf/brown dwarf binary.

Both long term X-ray light curves, X-ray spectra, the rapid\nX-ray variability and the radio jet behaviour are consistent with a model where\na standard outer accretion disc is truncated at low luminosities, being\nreplaced by a hot, inner flow which also acts as the launching site of the jet.\nDecreasing the disc truncation radius leads to softer spectra, as well as\nhigher frequencies (including QPO's) in the power spectra, and a faster jet.\nThe collapse of the hot flow when the disc reaches the last stable orbit\ntriggers the dramatic decrease in radio flux, as well as giving a qualitative\n(and often quantitative) explanation for the major hard--soft spectral\ntransition seen in black holes and neutron stars.\n  After collapse of the hot inner flow, the spectrum in black hole systems can\nbe dominated by the disc emission. Its behaviour is consistent with the\nexistence of a last stable orbit, and such data can be used to estimate the\nblack hole spin. These systems can also show very different spectra at these\nhigh luminosities, in which the disc spectrum is strongly distorted by\nComptonization. The structure of the accretion flow becomes increasingly\nuncertain as the luminosity approaches (and exceeds) the Eddington luminosity,\nthough there is growing evidence that winds play an important role.

Although some sources show a flattening of the radio spectral\nslope at high frequencies the average spectrum shows a steepening of the radio\nspectrum from 1.4 to 22.5 GHz. This is unexpected because in sources with high\nrates of star formation we expect flat spectrum, free-free emission to make a\nsignificant contribution to the radio flux at higher radio frequencies. Despite\nthis trend the radio spectral indices between 8.4 and 22.5 GHz are flatter for\nsources with higher values of the FIR-radio flux density ratio q, when this is\ncalculated at 8.4 GHz.

In the present study, we\ninvestigated the effects of selective inhibition of COX-2 with nimesulide (12\nmg/kg) and selective inhibition of COX-1 with valeryl salicylate (VAS, 12-120\nmg/kg) on prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, Evans\nblue (EB) extravasation and infarct volume in a standardized model of transient\nfocal cerebral ischaemia in the rat. Post-ischaemic treatment with nimesulide\nmarkedly reduced the increase in PGE2 levels in the ischaemic cerebral cortex\n24 h after stroke and diminished infarct size by 48% with respect to\nvehicle-treated animals after 3 days of reperfusion. Furthermore, nimesulide\nsignificantly attenuated the blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage and leukocyte\ninfiltration (as measured by EB leakage and MPO activity, respectively) seen at\n48 h after the initial ischaemic episode. These studies provide the first\nexperimental evidence that COX-2 inhibition with nimesulide is able to limit\nBBB disruption and leukocyte infiltration following transient focal cerebral\nischaemia. Neuroprotection afforded by nimesulide is observed even when the\ntreatment is delayed until 6 h after the onset of ischaemia, confirming a wide\ntherapeutic window of COX-2 inhibitors in experimental stroke. On the contrary,\nselective inhibition of COX-1 with VAS had no significant effect on the\nevaluated parameters. These data suggest that COX-2 activity, but not COX-1\nactivity, contributes to the progression of focal ischaemic brain injury, and\nthat the beneficial effects observed with non-selective COX inhibitors are\nprobably associated to COX-2 rather than to COX-1 inhibition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2007 15:47:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-08-02"}
