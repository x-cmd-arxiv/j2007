We discuss the\nconditions under which vortical perturbations evolve into long-lived persistent\nstructures and we describe the properties of these equilibrium vortices. The\nproperties of equilibrium vortices appear to be independent from the initial\nconditions and depend only on the local disk parameters. In particular we find\nthat the ratio of the vortex size to the local disk scale height increases with\nthe decrease of the sound speed, reaching values well above the unity. The\nprocess of spiral density wave generation by the vortex, discussed in our\nprevious work, appear to maintain its efficiency also at nonlinear amplitudes\nand we observe the formation of spiral shocks attached to the vortex.

Our study strengthens the arguments in\nfavor of anticyclonic vortices as the candidates for the promotion of planetary\nformation. Hydrodynamic shocks that are an intrinsic property of persistent\nvortices in compressible Keplerian flows are an important contributor to the\noverall balance.

We highlight the very different roles played by Type II and Type Ia\nsupernovae (SNe) in the chemical enrichment of the inner regions of the\nputative parent dSph. While the SNe II pollute the interstellar medium rather\nuniformly, the SNe Ia ejecta may remain confined inside dense pockets of gas as\nlong as succesive SNe II explosions spread them out. Stars forming in such\npockets have lower alpha-to-iron ratios than the stars forming elsewhere. Owing\nto the inhomogeneous pollution by SNe Ia, the metal distribution of the stars\nin the central region differs substantially from that of the main population of\nthe dwarf galaxy, and resembles that observed in Omega Cen. This inhomogeneous\nmixing is also responsible for a radial segregation of iron-rich stars with\ndepleted [alpha/Fe] ratios, as observed in some dSphs. Assuming a star\nformation history of ~1.5 Gyr, our model succeeds in reproducing both the iron\nand calcium distributions observed in Omega Cen and the main features observed\nin the empirical alpha/Fe versus Fe/H plane. Finally, our model reproduces the\noverall spread of the color-magnitude diagram, but fails in reproducing the\nmorphology of the SGB-a and the double morphology of the main sequence.\nHowever, the inhomogeneous pollution reduces (but does not eliminate) the need\nfor a significantly enhanced helium abundance to explain the anomalous position\nof the blue main sequence. Further models taking into account the dynamical\ninteraction of the parent dwarf galaxy with the Milky Way and the effect of AGB\npollution will be required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Aug 2007 20:46:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The Mn$_{12}$ molecular orbitals broaden due to the interaction of\nthe molecule with the gold surface and the broadening is of the order of 0.1\neV. It is an order of magnitude less than the single-electron charging energy\nof the molecule so the molecule is weakly bonded to the surface. Only electrons\nwith majority spin can be transferred from the surface to the sulfur-terminated\nMn$_{12}$ since the gold Fermi level is well above the majority lowest\nunoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) but below the minority LUMO. The amount of\nthe charge transfer is calculated to be 1.23 electrons, dominated by the tail\nin the electronic distribution of the gold surface. A calculation of level\nshift upon charging provides 0.28 electrons being transferred. The majority of\nthe charge transfer occurs at the S, C, and O atoms close to the surface. The\ntotal magnetic moment also changes from 18 $\\mu_B$ to 20 $\\mu_B$, due to\nrearrangements of the magnetic moments on the S and Mn atoms upon adsorption\nonto the surface.

The resulting entanglement is evaluated\nusing two measures: the average bipartite entanglement and the Groverian\nmeasure. A comparison is made between two geometries of the quantum register: a\none dimensional chain in which two-qubit gates apply only locally between\nnearest neighbors and a non-local geometry in which such gates may apply\nbetween any pair of qubits. More specifically, we use a combination of random\nsingle qubit rotations and a fixed two-qubit gate such as the controlled-phase\ngate. It is found that in the non-local geometry the entanglement is generated\nat a higher rate. In both geometries, the Groverian measure converges to its\nasymptotic value more slowly than the average bipartite entanglement. These\nresults are expected to have implications on different proposed geometries of\nfuture quantum computers with local and non-local interactions between the\nqubits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Aug 2007 13:47:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
