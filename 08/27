We provide\nan injective representation of these networks as multisets of vectors of\nnatural numbers, their path multiplicity vectors, and we use this\nrepresentation to define a distance on this class and to give an alignment\nmethod for pairs of these networks. To the best of our knowledge, they are\nrespectively the first true distance and the first alignment method defined on\na meaningful class of phylogenetic networks strictly extending the class of\nphylogenetic trees. Simple, polynomial algorithms for reconstructing a\ntree-child phylogenetic network from its path multiplicity vectors, for\ncomputing the distance between two tree-child phylogenetic networks, and for\naligning a pair of tree-child phylogenetic networks, are provided, and they\nhave been implemented as a Perl package and a Java applet, and they are\navailable at http://bioinfo.uib.es/~recerca/phylonetworks/mudistance\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2007 09:37:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-08-28"}

To keep the encoder complexity at minimum, the source is coded into K\ndescriptions by a simple multiple description quantizer (MDQ) with neither\nentropy nor channel coding. The code diversity of MDQ and the path diversity of\nthe network are exploited by decoders to correct transmission errors and\nimprove coding efficiency. A key design objective is resource scalability:\npowerful nodes in the network can perform JSC-MD distributed\nestimation/decoding under the criteria of maximum a posteriori probability\n(MAP) or minimum mean-square error (MMSE), while primitive nodes resort to\nsimpler MD decoding, all working with the same MDQ code. The application of\nJSC-MD to distributed estimation of hidden Markov models in a sensor network is\ndemonstrated. The proposed JSC-MD MAP estimator is an algorithm of the longest\npath in a weighted directed acyclic graph, while the JSC-MD MMSE decoder is an\nextension of the well-known forward-backward algorithm to multiple\ndescriptions. Both algorithms simultaneously exploit the source memory, the\nredundancy of the fixed-rate MDQ, and the inter-description correlations. They\noutperform the existing hard-decision MDQ decoders by large margins (up to\n8dB). For Gaussian Markov sources, the complexity of JSC-MD distributed MAP\nsequence estimation can be made as low as that of typical single description\nViterbi-type algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2007 03:11:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-08-28"}

The purpose of this study is to\nprovide a simple interpretation of these travel times. We study the interaction\nof surface-gravity waves with horizontal flows in an incompressible,\nplane-parallel solar atmosphere. We show that for uniform flows less than\nroughly 250 m s$^{-1}$, the travel-time shifts are linear in the flow\namplitude. For stronger flows, perturbation theory up to third order is needed\nto model waveforms. The case of small-amplitude spatially-varying flows is\ntreated using the first-order Born approximation. We derive two-dimensional\nFr\\'{e}chet kernels that give the sensitivity of travel-time shifts to local\nflows. We show that the effect of flows on travel times depends on wave damping\nand on the direction from which the observations are made. The main physical\neffect is the advection of the waves by the flow rather than the advection of\nwave sources or the effect of flows on wave damping. We compare the\ntwo-dimensional sensitivity kernels with simplified three-dimensional kernels\nthat only account for wave advection and assume a vertical line of sight. We\nfind that the three-dimensional f-mode kernels approximately separate in the\nhorizontal and vertical coordinates, with the horizontal variations given by\nthe simplified two-dimensional kernels.

Correspondence with the QCD diagrams at the\nboundary rapidities requires pomeron interaction with the participating nuclei\nto be exponential and non-local. Commonly used 'eikonal' boundary conditions,\nlocal and linear in fields, follow in the limit of small QCD pomeron-nucleon\ncoupling. Numerical solution of the classical field equations, which sum all\ntree diagrams for central gold-gold scattering, demonstrates that corrected\nboundary conditions lead to substantially different results, as compared to the\neikonal conditions studied in earlier publications. A breakdown of\nprojectile-target symmetry for particular solutions discovered earlier in\n  \\cite{bom} is found to occur at roughly twice lower rapidity. Most important,\ndue to a high non-linearity of the problem, the found asymmetric solutions are\nnot unique but form a family growing in number with rapidity. The minimal value\nfor the action turns out to be much lower than with the eikonal boundary\nconditions and saturates at rapidities around 10.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2007 15:44:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-27"}
