The\nresulting convection heats the intracluster plasma and regulates its\ntemperature and density profiles. By adjusting a single parameter in the model\n(the size of the cosmic-ray acceleration region), we are able to achieve a good\nmatch to the observed density and temperature profiles in a sample of eight\nclusters.

The CB regime, dominated by single charge effects, typically requires\na computationally demanding many-electron or Fock space description.

Subsequent radiative decay produces high vibrational levels of the\nground state, $X ^1\\Sigma_g^+$. The population distribution of these $X$ state\nvibrational levels is monitored by resonance-enhanced two-photon ionization\nthrough the $2 ^1\\Sigma_u^+$ state.

The resulting enhancement of more deeply bound ground-state molecule\nformation will be useful for future experiments on ultracold molecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2007 13:56:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-31"}

The\nhaloes are identified with a friends of friends algorithm in a large LCDM\nsimulation at two redshift snapshots (z=0 and 1), while halo substructure is\ndetermined using an observationally driven method. We find in both epochs a\nclear and significant signal by which haloes with substructure are more\nclustered than those with no-substructure. This is true for all the considered\nhalo mass ranges, although for the highest halo masses the signal is noisy and\npresent only out to ~20 h^{-1} Mpc. There is also a smooth increase of the halo\ncorrelation length with increasing amplitude of the halo substructure.

It is widely claimed that no\nmore than three adiabatic invariants can exist for the motion of a point\ncharge. However, additional independent (not separating) adiabatic invariants\ndo exist. For a force free motion, the components of angular momentum provide\ntwo additional constants of motion. This result can be generalized to the\nHamilton Jacobi equation. The number of independent constants of motion is\nreduced if there is a global symmetry. For a gyrating particle, neglecting a\ngyro helix type of invariant, four 'useful' invariants could exist. A radial\ndrift invariant, corresponding to the average of the radial coordinate of the\nparticle, is a constant of motion for a confined gyrating particle. For the\nspecial case of a screw pinch where each gyro center moves on a magnetic flux\nsurface without mirror trapping, the radial drift invariant is the radial\ncoordinate of the gyro center.

At the centre of our\nmodel lies the idea that radio emission at a particular frequency arises from a\nwide range of altitudes above the surface of the star and that it is confined\nto a region close to the last open field lines. We assert that the radial\nheight range over which emission occurs is responsible for the complex average\npulse shapes rather than the transverse (longitudinal) range proposed in most\ncurrent models. By implementing an abrupt change in the height range to\ndiscriminate between young, short-period, highly-energetic pulsars and their\nolder counterparts, we obtain the observed transition between the simple and\ncomplex average pulse profiles observed in each group respectively. Monte Carlo\nsimulations are used to demonstrate the match of our model to real\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2007 15:47:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Recently, Marchetti, Simons, and Littlewood have used a replica trick\nto investigate the effects of disorder on the condensation of cavity\npolaritons. Within their nonlinear sigma model, it was found that the\nsaddle-point equations assume the form reported previously by Zittartz in the\ncontest of the symmetry broken excitonic insulator, but with an order\nparameter, to which both photons and excitons contribute. In this paper, we\napply a closed-path time Green's function approach as an alternative to the\nreplica technique to formulate a nonperturbative description of cavity\npolaritons in the presence of a symmetry-breaking disorder. A field theoretical\nmethod is used to derive the Schwinger-Dyson equations for the average photon\nfield and the average single-particle Green's function. In contrast with the\nnonlinear sigma model and the corresponding saddle-point equations, we obtain\nthat the exact Schwinger-Dyson equations cannot be mapped to the corresponding\nequations derived by Zittartz. This result not only shows that the theory of\nZittartz cannot be applied to the excitons in a disordered quantum well coupled\nto the cavity photons with only minor modifications, but arises a question\nabout the validity of the replica trick as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2007 15:54:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-18"}

The determined periods are\nassumed to be related to rotation periods of the investigated stars. Among them\n10 new variables with periods longer than 10 days were found, which brings the\ntotal number of slowly rotating M stars with known rotation periods to 12\nobjects.\n  X-ray activity and rotation evolution of M stars follows the trends observed\nin G-K type stars. Rapidly rotating stars are very active and activity\ndecreases with increasing rotation period but the period-activity relation is\nmass-dependent which suggests that the rotation period alone is not a proper\nmeasure of activity. The investigated stars were grouped according to their\nmass and the empirical turnover time was determined for each group. It\nincreases with decreasing mass more steeply than for K type stars for which a\nflat dependence had been found. The resulting Rossby number-activity relation\nshows an exponential decrease of activity with increasing Rossby number.\n  The analysis of space motions of 27 single stars showed that all rapidly\nrotating and a few slowly rotating stars belong to young disk (YD) whereas all\nold disk (OD) stars are slowly rotating. The median rotation period of YD stars\nis about 2 days and that of OD stars is equal to 47 days, i.e. nearly 25 times\nlonger. The average X-ray flux of OD stars is about 1.7 dex lower than YD stars\nin a good agreement with the derived Rossby number-activity formula\nsupplemented with rotation-age relation and in a fair agreement with recent\nobservations but in a disagreement with the Skumanich formula supplemented with\nthe activity-rotation relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2007 10:24:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 May 2011 07:28:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-16"}
