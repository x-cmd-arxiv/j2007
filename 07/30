First, all scattered TNOs\nevolve through intermittent temporary resonance capture events and\ngravitational scattering by Neptune. Each scattered TNO experiences tens to\nhundreds of resonance captures over a period of 4 Gyr, which represents about\n38% of the object's lifetime (mean value). Second, resonance sticking plays an\nimportant role at semimajor axes a < 250 AU, where the great majority of such\ncaptures occurred. It is noteworthy that the stickiest (i.e., dominant)\nresonances in the scattered disk are located within this distance range and are\nthose possessing the lowest argument s. This was evinced by r:1, r:2 and r:3\nresonances, which played the greatest role during resonance sticking evolution,\noften leading to captures in several of their neighboring resonances. Finally,\nthe timescales and likelihood of temporary resonance captures are roughly\nproportional to resonance strength. The dominance of low s resonances is also\nrelated to the latter.

An introduction of\nthe galaxies immediately produces gravitational wakes, providing perturbations\nthat can potentially grow via resonant interaction with the background gas.\nWhen Ng^{1/2}Mg_11 < 100, where Mg_11 is each galaxy mass in units of 10^{11}\nMsun, the perturbations are in the linear regime and the resonant excitation of\ngravity waves is efficient to generate kinetic energy in the ICM, resulting in\nthe velocity dispersion sigma_v ~ 2.2 Ng^{1/2}Mg_11 km/s.

In Paper\nII (Tempel, Tamm & Tenjes 2007) we present similar data for the kinematics, and\nderive the mass distribution of the galaxy. On the basis of U, B, V, R, I and L\nluminosity distributions, we construct the model galaxy as a superposition of\nfour axially symmetric stellar components: a bulge, a disc, an inner halo and\nan extended diffuse halo. By using far-infrared imaging data of M31 and a thin\ndust disc assumption, we derive dust-free surface brightness and colour\ndistributions. We find the total absorption corrected luminosity of M31 to be\nL_B = (3.3+/-0.7)x10^10 L_sun, corresponding to an absolute luminosity M_B =\n-20.8+/-0.2 mag. Of the total luminosity, 41% (0.57 mag) is obscured from us by\nthe dust inside M31. Using chemical evolution models, we calculate\nmass-to-light ratios of the components, correspoding to the colour indices and\nmetallicities. We find the total intrinsic mass-to-light ratio of the visible\nmatter to be M/L_B=3.1-5.8 M_sun/L_sun and the total mass of visible matter\nM_vis =(10-19)x10^10 M_sun. The use of the model parameters for a dynamical\nanalysis and for determining dark matter distribution is presented in Paper II.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2007 11:49:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 2008 08:16:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 5 Sep 2008 05:28:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-05"}

The main goal of this study is the kinematic characterization\nof the cores in terms of rotation, turbulence, and fragmentation. Eight of the\nnine objects have compact N2H+ cores with FWHM radii of 1200 -- 3500 AU,\nspatially coinciding with the thermal dust continuum emission. The only more\nevolved (Class I) object in the sample (CB 188) shows only faint and extended\nN2H+ emission. The mean N2H+ line width was found to be 0.37 km/s. Estimated\nvirial masses range from 0.3 to 1.2 M_sun. We find that thermal and turbulent\nenergy support are about equally important in these cores, while rotational\nsupport is negligible. The measured velocity gradients across the cores range\nfrom 6 to 24 km/s/pc. Assuming these gradients are produced by bulk rotation,\nwe find that the specific angular momenta of the observed Class 0 protostellar\ncores are intermediate between those of dense (prestellar) molecular cloud\ncores and the orbital angular momenta of wide PMS binary systems. There appears\nto be no evolution (decrease) of angular momentum from the smallest prestellar\ncores via protostellar cores to wide PMS binary systems. In the context that\nmost protostellar cores are assumed to fragment and form binary stars, this\nmeans that most of the angular momentum contained in the collapse region is\ntransformed into orbital angular momentum of the resulting stellar binary\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2007 13:57:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
