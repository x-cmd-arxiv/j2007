We match the SAI Supernova Catalog to\nthe SDSS-DR4 catalog of star-forming galaxies with measured metallicities.\nThese supernova host galaxies span a range of oxygen abundance from 12 +\nlog(O/H) = 7.9 to 9.3 (~ 0.1 to 2.7 solar) and a range in absolute magnitude\nfrom MB = -15.2 to -22.2. To reduce the various observational biases, we select\na subsample of well-characterized supernovae in the redshift range from 0.01 to\n0.04, which leaves us with 58 SN II, 19 Ib/c, and 38 Ia. We find strong\nevidence that SN Ib/c are occurring in higher-metallicity host galaxies than SN\nII, while we see no effect for SN Ia relative to SN II. We note some extreme\nand interesting supernova-host pairs, including the metal-poor (~ 1/4 solar)\nhost of the recent SN Ia 2007bk, where the supernova was found well outside of\nthis dwarf galaxy. To extend the luminosity range of supernova hosts to even\nfainter galaxies, we also match all the historical supernovae with z < 0.3 to\nthe SDSS-DR6 sky images, resulting in 1225 matches. This allows us to identify\nsome even more extreme cases, such as the recent SN Ic 2007bg, where the likely\nhost of this hypernova-like event has an absolute magnitude MB ~ -12, making it\none of the least-luminous supernova hosts ever observed. This low-luminosity\nhost is certain to be very metal poor (~ 1/20 solar), and therefore this\nsupernova is an excellent candidate for association with an off-axis GRB. The\ntwo catalogs that we have constructed are available online and will be updated\nregularly.

We\nstress, and quantify by simple formulas, that the primary CMB anisotropies are\nvery susceptible to the gravitational potentials during horizon entry, less at\nrecombination. The CMB thus allows us to scan \\Phi+\\Psi and the underlying dark\nkinetics for all redshifts z~1-10^5. LSS, on the other hand, responds strongest\nto \\Phi at low redshifts. Dark perturbations are often parameterized by the\nanisotropic stress and effective sound speed (stiffness). We find that the dark\nanisotropic stress and stiffness influence the visible species at the\ncorrespondingly early and late stages of horizon entry, and affect stronger\nrespectively the CMB and LSS. The CMB yet remains essential to probing the\nstiff perturbations of light neutrinos and dark energy, detectable only during\nhorizon entry. The clustering of dark species and large propagation speed of\ntheir inhomogeneities also map to distinctive features in the CMB and LSS. -Any\nparameterization of the signatures of dark kinetics that assumes general\nrelativity can effectively accommodate any modified gravity (MG) that retains\nthe equivalence principle for the visible sectors.

The definitive signatures of MG may include the\nstrong dependence of the apparent dark dynamics on visible species, its\nsuperluminality, and the nonstandard phenomenology of gravitational waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2007 18:49:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-11"}

The relative sizes of the X/gamma-ray and VHE sources\nare consistent with the expected lifetimes against synchrotron and Compton\nlosses for a single source of parent electrons emitted from the pulsar. We find\nthat no other known object in the vicinity could be reasonably considered as a\nplausible counterpart to the HESS source. We conclude that there is good\nevidence to assume that the HESS J1616-508 source is driven by PSR J1617-5055\nin which a combination of synchrotron and inverse Compton processes combine to\ncreate the observed morphology of a broad-band emitter from keV to TeV\nenergies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2007 16:53:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Richard Nelson and Sidney Winter have argued that while\nevolutionary thinking was prevalent in prewar economics, the postwar\nNeoclassical school became almost entirely preoccupied with equilibrium\nconditions and their mathematical conditions. One of the problems with the\neconomic interpretation of firm selection through competition has been a weak\ngrasp on an incomplete scientific paradigm. As I.F. Price notes, \"The\nbiological metaphor has long lurked in the background of management theory\nlargely because the message of 'survival of the fittest' (usually wrongly\nattributed to Charles Darwin rather than Herbert Spencer) provides a seemingly\nnatural model for market competition (e.g. Alchian 1950, Merrell 1984,\nHenderson 1989, Moore 1993), without seriously challenging the underlying\nparadigms of what an organisation is.\" In this paper we examine the application\nof dynamic fitness landscape models to economic theory, particularly the theory\nof technology substitution, drawing on recent work by Kauffman, Arthur,\nMcKelvey, Nelson and Winter, and Windrum and Birchenhall. In particular we use\nProfessor Post's early work with John Holland on the genetic algorithm to\nexplain some of the key differences between static and dynamic approaches to\neconomic modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2007 18:47:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-02"}

This kind of scheduling, in which there is no consideration of\nnetwork characteristics, can lead to performance degradation in a Grid\nenvironment and may result in large processing queues and job execution delays\ndue to site overloads. In this paper we describe a Data Intensive and Network\nAware (DIANA) meta-scheduling approach, which takes into account data,\nprocessing power and network characteristics when making scheduling decisions\nacross multiple sites. Through a practical implementation on a Grid testbed, we\ndemonstrate that queue and execution times of data-intensive jobs can be\nsignificantly improved when we introduce our proposed DIANA scheduler. The\nbasic scheduling decisions are dictated by a weighting factor for each\npotential target location which is a calculated function of network\ncharacteristics, processing cycles and data location and size. The job\nscheduler provides a global ranking of the computing resources and then selects\nan optimal one on the basis of this overall access and execution cost. The\nDIANA approach considers the Grid as a combination of active network elements\nand takes network characteristics as a first class criterion in the scheduling\ndecision matrix along with computation and data. The scheduler can then make\ninformed decisions by taking into account the changing state of the network,\nlocality and size of the data and the pool of available processing cycles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2007 19:46:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-06"}

Therefore, it is convectively unstable region when the flux is positive,\nand it is convective overshooting zone when the flux becomes negative. The\nphysical picture of the overshooting zone drawn by the usual non-local\nmixing-length theory is not correct. In fact, convection is already\nsub-adiabatic ($\\nabla<\\nabla_{ad}$) far before reaching the unstable boundary;\nwhile in the overshooting zone below the convective zone, convection is\nsub-adiabatic and super-radiative ($\\nabla_{rad}<\\nabla<\\nabla_{ad}$).

We\ninvestigate two scenarios to explain a weak GRB : a normal (intrinsically\nbright) GRB seen off-axis or an intrinsically weak GRB seen on-axis. For each\nof these two scenarios, we first derive the conditions to produce a GRB\n980425-like event and we then discuss the consequences for the event rate. If\nwe exclude the possibility that GRB 980425 is an occurence of an extremely rare\nevent observed by chance during the first eight years of the 'afterglow era',\nthe first scenario implies that (i) the local rate of standard bright GRBs is\nmuch higher than what is usually expected; (ii) the typical opening angle is\nmuch narrower than what is derived from observations of a break in the\nafterglow lightcurve. In addition, we show that the afterglow of GRB 980425 in\nthis scenario should have been very bright and easily detected. For these\nreasons the second scenario appears more realistic. We show that the parameter\nspace of the internal shock model indeed allows GRB 980425-like events, in\ncases where the outflow is only mildly-relativistic and mildly-energetic. The\nrate of such weak events in the Universe has to be much higher than the rate of\nstandard bright GRBs to allow the discovery of GRB 980425 during a short period\nof a few years. However it is still compatible with the observations as the\nintrinsic weakness of these GRB 980425-like bursts does not allow detection at\ncosmological redshift.

The absorbed luminosity in the 0.2-2 kev\nenergy band was 2.7x10^38 erg/sec while the bolometric luminosity was a hundred\ntime higher (3.2x10^40 erg/s), making the source one of the most luminous of\nits class, assuming the best fit model is correct. Conclusions. This source is\nanother very luminous SSS for which the standard white dwarf interpretation\ncannot be applied, unless a strong beaming factor is considered. A stellar-mass\nblack hole accreting at a super Eddington rate is a more likely interpretation,\nwhere the excess of accreted matter is ejected through a strong optically-thick\noutflow. The 4 h modulation could either be an eclipse from the companion star\nor the consequence of a warped accretion disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jul 2007 09:53:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

A combination of low- and high-energy lines are important in\nconstraining the circumstellar distribution of SiS molecules. A detailed\nradiative transfer modelling of the observed SiS line emission is performed,\nincluding the effect of thermal dust grains in the excitation analysis. We find\nthat the circumstellar fractional abundance of SiS in these environments has a\nstrong dependence on the photospheric C/O-ratio as expected from chemical\nmodels. The carbon stars (C/O>1) have a mean fractional abundance of 3.1E-6,\nabout an order of magnitude higher than found for the M-type AGB stars (C/O<1)\nwhere the mean value is 2.7E-7. These numbers are in reasonable agreement with\nphotospheric LTE chemical models. SiS appears to behave similar to SiO in terms\nof photodissociation in the outer part of the circumstellar envelope. In\ncontrast to previous results for the related molecule SiO, there is no strong\ncorrelation of the fractional abundance with density in the CSE, as would be\nthe case if freeze-out onto dust grains were important. However, possible\ntime-variability of the line emission in the lower J transitions and the\nsensitivity of the line emission to abundance gradients in the inner part of\nthe CSE may mask a correlation with the density of the wind.
