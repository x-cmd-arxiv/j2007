We used interferometric observations in the N-band\nobtained with the MIDI instrument on the Very Large Telescope Interferometer,\ntogether with 10 micron spectra recorded by the infrared satellite Spitzer. The\nfact that we were able to determine N-band correlated fluxes and visibilities\nfor this comparatively faint source shows that MIR interferometry can be\napplied to a large number of low-mass young stellar objects.\n  The MIR spectra obtained with Spitzer reveal emission lines from HI (6-5), HI\n(7-6), and [Ne II] and show that over 90% of the dust we see in this wavelength\nregime is amorphous. According to the correlated flux measured with MIDI, most\nof the crystalline material is in the inner, unresolved part of the disk, about\n1 AU in radius. The visibilities exclude the existence of a very large (3-4 AU\nradius) inner hole in the circumstellar disk of TW Hya, which was required in\nearlier models. We propose instead a geometry of the inner disk where an inner\nhole still exists, but at a much reduced radius, with the transition from zero\nto full disk height between 0.5 and 0.8 AU, and with an optically thin\ndistribution of dust inside. Such a model can comply with SED and MIR\nvisibilities, as well as with visibility and extended emission observed in the\nNIR at 2 micron. If a massive planet was the reason for this inner hole, as has\nbeen speculated, its orbit would have to be closer to the star than 0.3 AU.\nAlternatively, we may be witnessing the end of the accretion phase and an early\nphase of an inward-out dispersal of the circumstellar disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2007 16:33:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The $V, (V-I)$ colour-magnitude diagram of the YSOs indicates\nthat majority of these objects have ages between 1 to 5 Myr. The spread in the\nages of the YSOs may indicate a non-coeval star formation in the cluster. The\nslope of the KLF for the cluster is estimated to be $0.34\\pm0.07$, which agrees\nwell with the average value ($\\sim 0.4$) reported for young clusters. For the\nentire observed mass range $0.6 < M/M_\\odot \\le 17.7$ the value of the slope of\nthe initial mass function, $`\\Gamma$', comes out to be $-1.27\\pm0.08$, which is\nin agreement with the Salpeter value of -1.35 in the solar neighborhood.\nHowever, the value of $`\\Gamma$' for PMS phase stars (mass range $0.6 <\nM/M_\\odot \\le 2.0$) is found to be $-0.88\\pm0.09$ which is shallower than the\nvalue ($-1.71\\pm0.20$) obtained for MS stars having mass range $2.5 < M/M_\\odot\n\\le 17.7$ indicating a break in the slope of the mass function at $\\sim 2\nM_\\odot$. Estimated $`\\Gamma$' values indicate an effect of mass segregation\nfor main-sequence stars, in the sense that massive stars are preferentially\nlocated towards the cluster center. The estimated dynamical evolution time is\nfound to be greater than the age of the cluster, therefore the observed mass\nsegregation in the cluster may be the imprint of the star formation process.\nThere is evidence for triggered star formation in the region, which seems to\ngovern initial morphology of the cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2007 16:46:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Dust emission from merging haloes is one of the foregrounds that\nwill affect such very small scales. We estimate the contribution to CMB angular\nfluctuations from objects that are bright in the sub-millimeter band due to\nintense star formation bursts following merging episodes. We base our approach\non the Lacey-Cole merger model and on the Kennicutt relation which connects the\nstar formation rate in galaxies with their infrared luminosity. We set the free\nparameters of the model in order to not exceed the SCUBA source counts, the\nMadau plot of star formation rate in the universe and COBE/FIRAS data on the\nintensity of the sub-millimeter cosmic background radiation. We show that the\nangular power spectrum arising from the distribution of such star-forming\nhaloes will be one of the most significant foregrounds in the high frequency\nchannels of future CMB experiments, such as PLANCK, ACT and SPT. The\ncorrelation term, due to the clustering of multiple haloes at redshift z~2-6,\nis dominant in the broad range of angular scales 200<l<3000. Poisson\nfluctuations due to bright sub-millimeter sources are more important at higher\nl, but since they are generated from the bright sources, such contribution\ncould be strongly reduced if bright sources are excised from the sky maps. The\ncontribution of the correlation term to the angular power spectrum depends\nstrongly on the redshift evolution of the escape fraction of UV photons and the\nresulting temperature of the dust.

The extent of `gaps' (missing transitional stages)\nhas been used to argue against gradual evolution from a common ancestor.\nTraditionally, gaps have often been explained by the improbability of\nfossilization and the discontinuous selection of found fossils. Here we take an\nanalytical approach and demonstrate why, under certain sampling conditions, we\nmay not expect intermediates to be found. Using a simple null model, we show\nmathematically that the question of whether a taxon sampled from some time in\nthe past is likely to be morphologically intermediate to other samples (dated\nearlier and later) depends on the shape and dimensions of the underlying\nphylogenetic tree that connects the taxa, and the times from which the fossils\nare sampled.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2007 01:24:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Aug 2008 23:50:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-27"}

Strong bisimulation between processes modeled in qCCS is\ndefined, and its fundamental algebraic properties are established, including\nuniqueness of the solutions of recursive equations. To model sequential\ncomputation in qCCS, a reduction relation between processes is defined. By\ncombining reduction relation and strong bisimulation we introduce the notion of\nstrong reduction-bisimulation, which is a device for observing interaction of\ncomputation and communication in quantum systems. Finally, a notion of strong\napproximate bisimulation (equivalently, strong bisimulation distance) and its\nreduction counterpart are introduced.

The redshift distribution of the SNe Ia reaches z ~ 1.6,\nwith a median of z ~ 1.2. The core-collapse SNe reach z ~ 1.0, with a median of\nz ~ 0.5. Our SN sample is comparable to the Hubble Space Telescope/GOODS sample\nboth in size and redshift range. The redshift distributions of the SNe in the\nSDF and in GOODS are consistent, but there is a trend (which requires\nconfirmation using a larger sample) for more high-z SNe Ia in the SDF. This\ntrend is also apparent when comparing the SN Ia rates we derive to those based\non GOODS data. Our results suggest a fairly constant rate at high redshift that\ncould be tracking the star-formation rate. Additional epochs on this field,\nalready being obtained, will enlarge our SN sample to the hundreds, and\ndetermine whether or not there is a decline in the SN Ia rate at z >~ 1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2007 11:28:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2007 11:57:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In our extensive investigation, it has been\nfound that the degradation of a watermarked audio signal caused by the DA/AD\nconversions manifests itself mainly in terms of wave magnitude distortion and\nlinear temporal scaling, making the watermark extraction failed.

To resist the magnitude distortion, the relative energy\nrelationships among different groups of the DWT coefficients in the\nlow-frequency sub-band are utilized in watermark embedding by adaptively\ncontrolling the embedding strength.

Many textbooks and commentators report that Bell's theorem\nrefutes the possibility (suggested especially by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen\nin 1935) of supplementing ordinary quantum theory with additional (\"hidden\")\nvariables that might restore determinism and/or some notion of an\nobserver-independent reality. On this view, Bell's theorem supports the\northodox Copenhagen interpretation. Bell's own view of his theorem, however,\nwas quite different. He instead took the theorem as establishing an \"essential\nconflict\" between the now well-tested empirical predictions of quantum theory\nand relativistic \\emph{local causality}. The goal of the present paper is, in\ngeneral, to make Bell's own views more widely known and, in particular, to\nexplain in detail Bell's little-known mathematical formulation of the concept\nof relativistic local causality on which his theorem rests.
