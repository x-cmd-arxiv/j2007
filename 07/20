The observations probe\nthe dense medium that was ejected by the progenitor star prior to its\nexplosion; the star might have been a Luminous Blue Variable. The radio imaging\nshows that the source remains compact, but it may be marginally resolved. The\nradio monitoring shows deviations from a smooth decay suggesting that\ninhomogeneities are present in the radio emitting region. It appears that a\nmajor change occurred in the mass-loss rate of the progenitor star shortly\nbefore the supernova event. The X-ray emission between 2000 and 2006 is\nconsistent with the radiation coming from two shocks. All the X-ray data can be\nfit using the same model (with no systematic evolution or short-term\nvariability) but this has a surprising requirement: the X-ray emitting regions\nhave a very large abundance of helium. This would be consistent with the X-ray\nemitting shocks being located in a helium-rich layer that was ejected by the\nprogenitor star, or helium-rich material was ejected in the supernova\nexplosion. The unusual properties of the supernova motivated a search for an\nassociated gamma-ray burst (GRB). We show that SN 1978K was inside the ~4 sigma\nerror box of GRB 771029. If this association is correct, the GRB was\nexceptionally underluminous. However, the quality of the gamma-ray burst\nlocations at that time was poor, and this is likely just a chance alignment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2007 19:16:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

We include the orbital dynamics of\nKeplerian disks, both in-plane epicycles and vertical oscillations. We obtain a\nnew result for the diffusion of solids. The Schmidt number (ratio of gas to\nparticle diffusivity) is Sc = 1 + (Omega t_stop)^2, in terms of the particle\nstopping time, t_stop, and the orbital frequency, Omega. The standard result,\nSc = 1 + t_stop/t_eddy, in terms of the eddy turnover time, t_eddy, is shown to\nbe incorrect. The main difference is that Sc rises quadratically, not linearly,\nwith stopping time. Consequently, particles larger than ~ 10 cm in\nprotoplanetary disks will suffer less radial diffusion and will settle closer\nto the midplane. Such a layer of boulders would be more prone to gravitational\ncollapse. Our predictions of RMS speeds, vertical scale height and diffusion\ncoefficients will help interpret numerical simulations.

For an increase of radius, intensity of extreme UV and\ntemperature decrease, so that the plasma contains more and more atoms. A\nspherical shell, mainly of neutral atoms (H I) appears. If this shell is\noptically thick at Lyman frequencies of H I, it is superradiant and a\ncompetition of modes selects modes tangent to a sphere for which many atoms are\nexcited. Thus, a shell of plasma emits, into a given direction, tangential rays\nshowing a ring in which selected modes are brighter. While at Lyman\nfrequencies, absorption of rays emitted by the source excites the atoms able to\namplify the superradiance, a more powerful amplification of superradiance\nresults from an induced scattering of the radial beams, which extends to feet\nof lines and progressively to the whole spectrum. Thermodynamics says that the\nbrightness of radial and tangential beams tends to be equal; if the solid angle\nof observation is much larger for the ring than for the source, almost the\nwhole light emitted by the source is transferred to the rings, and the source\nbecomes invisible. Paradoxically, a glow due to incoherent scattering and\nimpurities around the source remains visible.

Simulating a stellar collision event can be an intensive\nnumerical task, as detailed calculations of this process require hydrodynamic\nsimulations in three dimensions. We present a computationally inexpensive\nmethod in which we approximate the merger process, including shock heating,\nhydrodynamic mixing and mass loss, with a simple algorithm based on\nconservation laws and a basic qualitative understanding of the hydrodynamics of\nstellar mergers. The algorithm relies on Archimedes' principle to dictate the\ndistribution of the fluid in the stable equilibrium situation. We calibrate and\napply the method to mergers of massive stars, as these are expected to occur in\nyoung and dense star clusters. We find that without the effects of microscopic\nmixing, the temperature and chemical composition profiles in a collision\nproduct can become double-valued functions of enclosed mass. Such an unphysical\nsituation is mended by simulating microscopic mixing as a post-collision\neffect. In this way we find that head-on collisions between stars of the same\nspectral type result in substantial mixing, while mergers between stars of\ndifferent spectral type, such as type B and O stars ($\\sim$10 and $\\sim$40\\msun\nrespectively), are subject to relatively little hydrodynamic mixing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2007 09:13:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2007 12:09:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We consider\nmetric cones with reducible holonomy over pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. First we\ndescribe the local structure of the base of the cone when the holonomy of the\ncone is decomposable. For instance, we find that the holonomy algebra of the\nbase is always the full pseudo-orthogonal Lie algebra. One of the global\nresults is that a cone over a compact and complete pseudo-Riemannian manifold\nis either flat or has indecomposable holonomy. Then we analyse the case when\nthe cone has indecomposable but reducible holonomy, which means that it admits\na parallel isotropic distribution. This analysis is carried out, first in the\ncase where the cone admits two complementary distributions and, second for\nLorentzian cones. We show that the first case occurs precisely when the local\ngeometry of the base manifold is para-Sasakian and that of the cone is\npara-K\\\"ahlerian.

This is\nmainly due to the highly time varying characteristics of the channel. In this\ncontribution, it will be shown how free probability can be used for channel\ncapacity estimation in MIMO systems. Free probability has already been applied\nin various application fields such as digital communications, nuclear physics\nand mathematical finance, and has been shown to be an invaluable tool for\ndescribing the asymptotic behaviour of many large-dimensional systems. In\nparticular, using the concept of free deconvolution, we provide an\nasymptotically (w.r.t. the number of observations) unbiased capacity estimator\nfor MIMO channels impaired with noise called the free probability based\nestimator. Another estimator, called the Gaussian matrix mean based estimator,\nis also introduced by slightly modifying the free probability based estimator.\nThis estimator is shown to give unbiased estimation of the moments of the\nchannel matrix for any number of observations. Also, the estimator has this\nproperty when we extend to MIMO channels with phase off-set and frequency\ndrift, for which no estimator has been provided so far in the literature. It is\nalso shown that both the free probability based and the Gaussian matrix mean\nbased estimator are asymptotically unbiased capacity estimators as the number\nof transmit antennas go to infinity, regardless of whether phase off-set and\nfrequency drift are present. The limitations in the two estimators are also\nexplained. Simulations are run to assess the performance of the estimators for\na low number of antennas and samples to confirm the usefulness of the\nasymptotic results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2007 15:43:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2007 19:10:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 7 Mar 2008 12:44:46 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 15 May 2008 19:03:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
