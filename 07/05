As a consequence the microlensed source stars are often blended\nwith nearby unresolved stars. The presence of `blending' is a cause of major\nuncertainty when determining the lensing properties of events towards the\nGalactic centre. After demonstrating empirical cases of blending we utilize\nMonte Carlo simulations to probe the effects of blending. We generate\nartificial microlensing events using an HST luminosity function convolved to\ntypical ground-based seeing, adopting a range of values for the stellar density\nand seeing. We find that a significant fraction of bright events are blended,\ncontrary to the oft-quoted assumption that bright events should be free from\nblending. We probe the effect that this erroneous assumption has on both the\nobserved event timescale distribution and the optical depth, using realistic\ndetection criteria relevent to the different surveys. Importantly, under this\nassumption the latter quantity appears to be reasonably unaffected across our\nadopted values for seeing and density. The timescale distribution is however\nbiased towards smaller values, even for the least dense fields. The dominant\nsource of blending is from lensing of faint source stars, rather than lensing\nof bright source stars blended with nearby fainter stars. We also explore other\nissues, such as the centroid motion of blended events and the phenomena of\n`negative' blending. Furthermore, we breifly note that blending can affect the\ndetermination of the centre of the red clump giant region from an observed\nluminosity function. This has implications for a variety of studies, e.g.\nmapping extinction towards the bulge and attempts to constrain the parameters\nof the Galactic bar through red clump giant number counts.

In particular, they may be\nimportant in the collapsar scenario for gamma-ray bursts (GRB), where the\ncentral engine is a hyper-accreting black hole or a millisecond magnetar. The\npresent paper is focussed on the magnetar scenario, with a specific emphasis on\nthe interaction of the magnetar magnetosphere with the infalling stellar\nenvelope. First, the ``Pulsar-in-a-Cavity'' problem is introduced as a paradigm\nfor a magnetar inside a collapsing star. The basic set-up of this fundamental\nplasma-physics problem is described, outlining its main features, and simple\nestimates are derived for the evolution of the magnetic field. In the context\nof a collapsing star, it is proposed that, at first, the ram pressure of the\ninfalling plasma acts to confine the magnetosphere, enabling a gradual build-up\nof the magnetic pressure. At some point, the growing magnetic pressure\novertakes the (decreasing) ram pressure of the gas, resulting in a\nmagnetically-driven explosion. The explosion should be highly anisotropic, as\nthe hoop-stress of the toroidal field, confined by the surrounding stellar\nmatter, collimates the magnetically-dominated outflow into two beamed\nmagnetic-tower jets. This creates a clean narrow channel for the escape of\nenergy from the central engine through the star, as required for GRBs. In\naddition, the delayed onset of the collimated-explosion phase can explain the\nproduction of large quantities of Nickel-56, as suggested by the GRB-Supernova\nconnection.

These characteristics are\nconstrained from a parametric description of the UV spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) of a galaxy, as enforced by combined stellar population and\nradiative transfer models for different geometries, dust/stars configurations\nand dust properties. In at least one third of the sample, there is a robust\nevidence for extinction curves with at least a moderate UV bump. The presence\nof the carriers of the UV bump is more evident in galaxies with UV SEDs\nsuffering from heavy reddening. We interpret these results as follows. The\nsample objects possess different mixtures of dust grains and molecules\nproducing extinction curves in between the average ones of the Small and Large\nMagellanic Cloud, where the UV bump is absent or modest, respectively. Most of\nthe dust embeds the UV-emitting stellar populations or is distributed out of\nthe galaxy mid-plane.

Hence, additional extraplanar dust\nhas to be invoked.

We show\nthat Haro 11 has extended, soft thermal (kT~0.68 keV) X-ray emission with a\nluminosity and size which scales with the physical properties (e.g. SFR,\nstellar mass) of the host galaxy. An enhanced alpha/Fe, ratio of ~4 relative to\nsolar abundance suggests significant supernovae enrichment. These results are\nconsistent with the X-ray emission being produced in a shock between a\nsupernovae driven outflow and the ambient material.

This is most likely due to the\ncondensation of baryons leading to rounder halos. We examine the halo phase\nspace distribution basis for such shape changes. Triaxial halos are supported\nby box orbits, which pass arbitrarily close to the density center. The decrease\nin triaxiality caused by baryons is thought to be due to the scattering of\nthese orbits. We test this hypothesis with simulations of disks grown inside\ntriaxial halos. After the disks are grown we check whether the phase space\nstructure has changed by evaporating the disks and comparing the initial and\nfinal states. While the halos are substantially rounder when the disk is at\nfull mass, their final shape after the disk is evaporated is not much different\nfrom the initial. Likewise, the halo becomes (more) radially anisotropic when\nthe disk is grown, but the final anisotropy is consistent with the initial.\nOnly if the baryons are unreasonably compact or massive does the halo change\nirreversibly. We show that the character of individual orbits is not generally\nchanged by the growing mass. Thus the central condensation of baryons does not\ndestroy enough box orbits to cause the shape change. Rather, box orbits merely\nbecome rounder along with the global potential. However, if angular momentum is\ntransferred to the halo, either via satellites or via bars, a large\nirreversible change in the halo distribution occurs. The ability of satellites\nto alter the phase space distribution of the halo is of particular concern to\ngalaxy formation simulations since halo triaxiality can profoundly influence\nthe evolution of disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2007 08:53:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Jun 2008 01:18:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Here we show that the propagation of photons in waveguide\nlattices, which have been studied extensively in recent years, are essentially\nan implementation of quantum walks. Since waveguide lattices are easily\nconstructed at large scales and display negligible decoherence, they can serve\nas an ideal and versatile experimental playground for the study of quantum\nwalks and quantum algorithms. We experimentally observe quantum walks in large\nsystems (~100 sites) and confirm quantum walks effects which were studied\ntheoretically, including ballistic propagation, disorder and boundary related\neffects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2007 11:49:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2007 05:49:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2007 08:34:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 10 Apr 2008 11:17:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-05-19"}

The general situation of an arbitrary number of states\nand arbitrary number of nuclear degrees of freedom (modes) is considered. The\nmacrosystem is decomposed into a system part carrying a few, strongly coupled\nmodes, and an environment, comprising the vast number of remaining modes. By\nsuccessively transforming the modes of the environment, a hierarchy of\neffective Hamiltonians for the environment is constructed. Each effective\nHamiltonian depends on a reduced number of effective modes, which carry\ncumulative effects.

Since 1997 an increasing number of sdB stars has been\nfound to pulsate forming two classes of stars (the V361 Hya and V1093 Her\nstars). We focus on the bright V 361 Hya star PG1605+072 to characterize its\nfrequency spectrum. While most previous studies relied on light variations, we\nhave measured radial velocity variations for as much as 20 modes. In this paper\nwe aim at characterizing the modes from atmospheric parameter and radial\nvelocity variations. Time resolved spectroscopy ($\\approx$9000 spectra) has\nbeen carried out to detect line profile variations from which variations of the\neffective temperature and gravity are extracted by means of a quantitative\nspectral analysis. We measured variations of effective temperatures and\ngravities for eight modes with semi-amplitudes ranging from $\\Delta\nT_{\\rm{eff}}=880$ K to as small as 88 K and $\\Delta\\log{g}$ of 0.08 dex to as\nlow as 0.008 dex. Gravity and temperature vary almost in phase, whereas phase\nlags are found between temperature and radial velocity. This profound analysis\nof a unique data set serves as sound basis for the next step towards an\nidentification of pulsation modes. As rotation may play an important role the\nmodelling of pulsation modes is challenging but feasible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2007 15:26:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The observations\ninterpreted here, especially the depletion of lithium seen in HE1327-2326,\nfavor the binary mass-transfer hypothesis. If HE0107-5240 and HE1327-2326\nformed in binary systems, the statistically significant absence of isolated\nand/or C-normal stars at similar [Fe/H] implies that low-mass stars could form\nat that metallicity, but that masses M ~< 1.4 Msun were disfavored in the IMF.\nThis result is also explained if the abundance-derived top-heavy IMF for\nprimordial stars persists to [Fe/H] ~ -5.5. This finding indicates that\nlow-mass star formation was possible at extremely low metallicity, and that the\ntypical stellar mass may have had a complex dependence on metallicity rather\nthan a sharp transition driven solely by gas cooling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2007 15:47:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}
