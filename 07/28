An analysis of published data reveals\nthat the centres of galaxies with power-law central SB profiles have younger\nstellar populations than the centres of cored galaxies. We argue that thermal\nevaporation of cold gas by virial-temperature gas plays an important role in\ndetermining these phenomena. In less massive galaxies, thermal evaporation is\nnot very efficient, so significant amounts of cold gas can reach the galaxy\ncentre and fill a central core with newly formed stars, consistent with the\nyoung stellar ages of the cusps of Es with power-law SB profiles. In more\nmassive galaxies, cold gas is evaporated within a dynamical time, so star\nformation is inhibited, and a core in the stellar density profile produced by\ndissipationless dynamics cannot be refilled. The different observed properties\nof AGN in higher-mass and lower-mass ellipticals are also explained because in\nthe former the central black holes invariably accrete hot gas, while in the\nlatter they typically accrete cold gas.
