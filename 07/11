This assumption may lead to very different\nobservational consequences compared to the case of a standard cosmology where\nthe energy density of the Universe is dominated by radiation. We show that,\ndepending on the choice of the temperature T_r above which kination dominates\nover radiation, any situation between the strong and the super--weak wash--out\nregime are equally viable for leptogenesis, even with the RHN Yukawa coupling\nfixed to provide the observed atmospheric neutrino mass scale ~ 0.05 eV.

The abiotic production of these two gases, which are also characteristic\nof photosynthetic life processes, could pose a potential \"false-positive\" for\nremote-sensing detection of life on planets around other stars.We show here\nthat such false positives are unlikely on any planet that possesses abundant\nliquid water, as rainout of oxidized species onto a reduced planetary surface\nshould ensure that atmospheric H2 concentrations remain relatively high, and\nthat O2 and O3 remain low. Our aim is to determine the amount of O3 and O2\nformed in a high CO2 atmosphere for a habitable planet without life. We use a\nphotochemical model that considers hydrogen (H2) escape and a detailed hydrogen\nbalance to calculate the O2 and O3 formed on planets with 0.2 of CO2 around the\nSun, and 0.02, 0.2 and 2 bars of CO2 around a young Sun-like star with higher\nUV radiation. The concentrations obtained by the photochemical model were used\nas input in a radiative transfer model that calculated the spectra of the\nmodeled planets. The O3 and O2 concentrations in the simulated planets are\nextremely small, and unlikely to produce a detectable signature in the spectra\nof those planets. We conclude that with a balanced hydrogen budget, and for\nplanets with an active hydrological cycle, abiotic formation of O2 and O3 is\nunlikely to create a possible false positive for life detection in either the\nvisible/near-infrared or mid-infrared wavelength regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2007 05:07:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

First, we describe numerical methods for the acceleration of the\nconvergence of series. These provide a useful toolbox for theoretical physics\nwhich has hitherto not received the attention it actually deserves. The\nunifying concept for convergence acceleration methods is that in many cases,\none can reach much faster convergence than by adding a particular series term\nby term. In some cases, it is even possible to use a divergent input series,\ntogether with a suitable sequence transformation, for the construction of\nnumerical methods that can be applied to the calculation of special functions.\nThis review both aims to provide some practical guidance as well as a\ngroundwork for the study of specialized literature. As a second topic, we\nreview some recent developments in the field of Borel resummation, which is\ngenerally recognized as one of the most versatile methods for the summation of\nfactorially divergent (perturbation) series. Here, the focus is on algorithms\nwhich make optimal use of all information contained in a finite set of\nperturbative coefficients. The unifying concept for the various aspects of the\nBorel method investigated here is given by the singularities of the Borel\ntransform, which introduce ambiguities from a mathematical point of view and\nlead to different possible physical interpretations. The two most important\ncases are: (i) the residues at the singularities correspond to the decay width\nof a resonance, and (ii) the presence of the singularities indicates the\nexistence of nonperturbative contributions which cannot be accounted for on the\nbasis of a Borel resummation and require generalizations toward resurgent\nexpansions.

These decoupling limits lead to decoupled theories that are\nmuch simpler than the full N=4 SYM but still contain many of its interesting\nfeatures. The decoupling limits correspond to being in a near-critical region,\nnear a point with zero temperature and critical chemical potentials. The new\ndecoupling limits are found by generalizing the limits of hep-th/0605234 to\ninclude not only the chemical potentials for the SU(4) R-symmetry of N=4 SYM\nbut also the chemical potentials corresponding to the SO(4) symmetry. In the\ndecoupled theories it is possible to take a strong coupling limit in a\ncontrollable manner since the full effective Hamiltonian is known. For planar\nN=4 SYM on R x S^3 all the decoupled theories correspond to fully integrable\nspin chains. We study the thermodynamics of the decoupled theories and find the\nHagedorn temperature for small and large values of the effective coupling. We\nfind an alternative formulation of the decoupling limits in the microcanonical\nensemble. This leads to a characterization of certain regimes of weakly coupled\nN=4 SYM in which there are string-like states. Finally, we find a similar\ndecoupling limit for pure Yang-Mills theory, which for the planar limit leads\nto a fully integrable decoupled theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2007 13:53:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2007 09:20:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-30"}

U-relations support\nattribute-level uncertainty using vertical partitioning. If we consider\npositive relational algebra extended by an operation for computing possible\nanswers, a query on the logical level can be translated into, and evaluated as,\na single relational algebra query on the U-relation representation. The\ntranslation scheme essentially preserves the size of the query in terms of\nnumber of operations and, in particular, number of joins. Standard techniques\nemployed in off-the-shelf relational database management systems are effective\nfor optimizing and processing queries on U-relations. In our experiments we\nshow that query evaluation on U-relations scales to large amounts of data with\nhigh degrees of uncertainty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2007 15:13:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-12"}

Our\napproach allows each vertex of the graph to belong to multiple communities at\nthe same time, determined by exact numerical membership degrees, even in the\npresence of uncertainty in the data being analyzed. We created an algorithm for\ndetermining the optimal membership degrees with respect to a given goal\nfunction. Based on the membership degrees, we introduce a new measure that is\nable to identify outlier vertices that do not belong to any of the communities,\nbridge vertices that belong significantly to more than one single community,\nand regular vertices that fundamentally restrict their interactions within\ntheir own community, while also being able to quantify the centrality of a\nvertex with respect to its dominant community. The method can also be used for\nprediction in case of uncertainty in the dataset analyzed. The number of\ncommunities can be given in advance, or determined by the algorithm itself\nusing a fuzzified variant of the modularity function.
