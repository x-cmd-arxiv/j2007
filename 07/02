Traditionally, all the CG iteration vectors could\nbe saved and recombined through the eigenvectors of the tridiagonal projection\nmatrix, which is equivalent theoretically to unrestarted Lanczos. Our algorithm\ncapitalizes on the iteration vectors produced by CG to update only a small\nwindow of vectors that approximate the eigenvectors. While this window is\nrestarted in a locally optimal way, the CG algorithm for the linear system is\nunaffected. Yet, in all our experiments, this small window converges to the\nrequired eigenvectors at a rate identical to unrestarted Lanczos. After the\nsolution of the linear system, eigenvectors that have not accurately converged\ncan be improved in an incremental fashion by solving additional linear systems.\nIn this case, eigenvectors identified in earlier systems can be used to\ndeflate, and thus accelerate, the convergence of subsequent systems. We have\nused this algorithm with excellent results in lattice QCD applications, where\nhundreds of right hand sides may be needed. Specifically, about 70 eigenvectors\nare obtained to full accuracy after solving 24 right hand sides. Deflating\nthese from the large number of subsequent right hand sides removes the dreaded\ncritical slowdown, where the conditioning of the matrix increases as the quark\nmass reaches a critical value.

The gluon polarisation is accessed by the selection of photon-gluon\nfusion (PGF) events. A very clean selection of PGF events can be obtained with\ncharmed mesons in the final state. Their detection is based on the\nreconstruction of D* and D0 mesons in the COMPASS spectrometer.

The\ninterferometric measurements are spectrally resolved (R = 30) in the wavelength\nrange 8 to 13 micron. Their spatial resolution reaches 15 mas at the shortest\nwavelengths. Supplementary observations were obtained in the near-infrared with\nthe adaptive optics instrument NACO, and at mm wavelengths with SEST and JCMT.\nWe find that he mid-infrared emission from the core of Centaurus A is dominated\nby an unresolved point source (<10 mas). Observations with baselines orientated\nperpendicular to the radio jet reveal an extended component which can be\ninterpreted as a geometrically thin, dusty disk, the axis of which is aligned\nwith the radio jet. Its diameter is about 0.6 pc. We argue, that the unresolved\nemission is dominated by a synchrotron source.

The basic imaging element of these\narrays is the two-element interferometer. Accurate knowledge of two quantities\nis required: the \\textit{projected baseline length}, which is the distance\nbetween the two interferometer elements projected on the plane tranverse to the\nline of sight to the target; and the \\textit{optical path difference}, which is\nthe difference in the distances from that transverse plane to the beam\ncombiner. ``Rules-of-thumb'' are determined for the typical accuracy required\non these parameters. The requirement on the projected baseline length is a\n\\textit{knowledge} requirement and depends on the angular size of the targets\nof interest; it is generally at a level of half a meter for typical stellar\ntargets, decreasing to perhaps a few centimeters only for the widest attainable\nfields of view. The requirement on the optical path difference is a\n\\textit{control} requirement and is much tighter, depending on the bandwidth of\nthe signal; it is at a level of half a wavelength for narrow (few %) signal\nbands, decreasing to $\\approx 0.2 \\lambda$ for the broadest bandwidths expected\nto be useful. Translation of these requirements into engineering requirements\non station-keeping accuracy depends on the specific details of the collector\nconstellation geometry. Several examples are provided to guide future\napplication of the criteria presented here. Some implications for the design of\nsuch collector constellations and for the methods used to transform the\ninformation acquired into images are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2007 15:38:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
