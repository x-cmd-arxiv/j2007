When interactions\nbetween the particles compete with their mobility through a tunnel junction,\nintriguing novel dynamical behaviour can arise where particles do not tunnel\nindependently. In single-electron or Bloch transistors, for example, the\ntunnelling of an electron or Cooper pair can be enabled or suppressed by the\npresence of a second charge carrier due to Coulomb blockade. Here we report on\nthe first direct and time-resolved observation of correlated tunnelling of two\ninteracting atoms through a barrier in a double well potential. We show that\nfor weak interactions between the atoms and dominating tunnel coupling,\nindividual atoms can tunnel independently, similar to the case in a normal\nJosephson junction. With strong repulsive interactions present, two atoms\nlocated on one side of the barrier cannot separate, but are observed to tunnel\ntogether as a pair in a second order co-tunnelling process. By recording both\nthe atom position and phase coherence over time, we fully characterize the\ntunnelling process for a single atom as well as the correlated dynamics of a\npair of atoms for weak and strong interactions.

These may be mistaken for Dark Galaxies, a putative class of gaseous,\ndark matter dominated, objects which for some reason never managed to form\nstars. VirgoHI21 is by far the most spectacular and most discussed Dark Galaxy\ncandidate so far detected in HI surveys. We show here that it is most likely\nmade out of material expelled 750 Myr ago from the nearby spiral galaxy NGC\n4254 during its fly--by at about 1000 km/s by a massive intruder. Our numerical\nmodel of the collision is able to reproduce the main characteristics of the\nsystem: in particular the absence of stars, and its prominent velocity\ngradient. Originally attributed to the gas being in rotation within a massive\ndark matter halo, we find it instead to be consistent with a combination of\nsimple streaming motion plus projection effects (Duc & Bournaud, 2007). We\ndiscuss several ways to identify a tidal origin in a Dark Galaxy candidate and\nillustrate the method using another HI system in Virgo, VCC 2062, which is most\nlikely a Tidal Dwarf Galaxy (Duc et al., 2007). Now, whereas tidal debris\nshould not contain any dark matter from the halo of their parent galaxies, it\nmay exhibit missing mass in the form of dark baryons, unaccounted for by\nclassical observations, as recently found in the collisional ring of NGC 5291\n(Bournaud et al., 2007) and probably in the TDG VCC 2062.

These explosions\nwere one or two orders of magnitude lower in energy than that of Nova Sco. Cyg\nX - 1 (1956 + 350) had an even less energetic explosion, because of an even\nlarger donor mass.\n  We find that in the evolution of the soft X-ray transient sources the donor\n(secondary star) is tidally locked with the helium star, which evolved from the\ngiant, as the hydrogen envelope is stripped off in common envelope evolution.\nThe tidal locking is transferred from the helium star to the black hole into\nwhich it falls. Depending on the mass of the donor, the black hole can be spun\nup to the angular momentum necessary to power the GRB and Hypernova explosion.\nThe donor decouples, acting as a passive witness to the explosion which, for\nthe given angular momentum, then proceeds as in the Woosley Collapsar model.\n  High mass donors which tend to follow from low metallicity give long GRBs\nbecause their lower energy can be accepted by the central engine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2007 23:58:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2007 14:56:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Two different crystal structures\ncompete in the thermodynamic conditions under study. We find that the crystal\nphase that nucleates is metastable and, more surprisingly, its nucleation free\nenergy barrier is not the lowest one. This implies that, during nucleation,\nthere is insufficient time for sub-critical nuclei to relax to their lowest\nfree-energy structure. Such behavior is in direct contradiction with the common\nassumption that the phase that crystallizes most readily is the one with the\nlowest free-energy barrier for nucleation. The phenomenon that we describe\nshould be relevant for crystallization experiments where competing solid\nstructures are not connected by an easy transformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2007 13:45:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-10"}

(In\nparticular, this includes all entire functions with finite postsingular set.)\nIf f is geometrically finite, then the Fatou set of f is either empty or\nconsists of the basins of attraction of finitely many attracting or parabolic\ncycles.\n  Let z_0 be a repelling or parabolic periodic point of such a map f. We show\nthat, if f has finite order, then there exists an injective curve consisting of\nescaping points of f that connects z_0 to infinity. (This curve is called a\ndynamic ray.) In fact, the assumption of finite order can be weakened\nconsiderably; for example, it is sufficient to assume that f can be written as\na finite composition of finite-order functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2007 15:18:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Feb 2009 14:52:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-02"}

Profiles for\ncollisional broadening due to H2 and He based on the adiabatic representation\nshow strong deviations from Van der Waals interaction at short distances.\nComparison with observed spectra that show extremely broadened Na I lines\nindicates that a He-rich atmospheric composition is required to explain the\nline strengths and spectral energy distributions. Our current synthetic\nspectra, using an expansion in powers of density to the third order optimised\nfor brown dwarf atmosphere conditions, significantly underestimate the observed\nabsorption in the far wings, even predicting smaller total line strength than a\nLorentzian profile. This is due to the handling of multiple perturber\ninteractions becoming inadequate for the extreme densities of the coolest white\ndwarfs. The density expansion would have to be extended at least to the 7th\norder for an accurate treatment of such conditions and might break down\naltogether in the densest objects. The results of a direct calculation of the\nunified profile should therefore be used for model atmospheres of cool\nmetal-rich white dwarfs. Qualitative comparison of the full adiabatic profile\nto the spectrum of WD2356-209 indicates good agreement with the observed line\nshape. Observations of the coolest white dwarfs may therefore serve as a\nlaboratory for testing the physics of the deeper atmospheres and interiors of\nbrown dwarfs and giant planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2007 15:35:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Jul 2007 11:35:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-30"}
