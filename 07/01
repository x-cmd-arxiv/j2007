In the\nfirst part we deal with the boundary bootstrap in supersymmetric factorized\nscattering theory. We give a description of supersymmetry in the case when the\nspace is a half-line and present rules for the determination of the\nrepresentations in which higher level boundary bound states transform, and for\nthe determination of the supersymmetric one-particle reflection matrix factors\nfor the higher level boundary bound states. These rules apply under the\ncondition that the bulk particles transform in the kink or in the boson-fermion\nrepresentation. Examples for the application of these rules to specific models\nare also given. In the second part we investigate the problem whether the TCSA\nspectrum can be approximated by the spectrum of the original Hamiltonian\noperator in which the coefficients of the terms are suitably changed. The\ninvestigation is done in the case of the critical Ising model on a strip with\nan external magnetic field on one of the boundaries. Another truncation method\nthat preserves the solvability of the model is also considered. The results of\nperturbative and numerical calculations show that the above approximation is\npossible and that the qualitative behaviour of the truncated spectrum as a\nfunction of the coupling constant depends on the truncation method. In the\nthird part we investigate the phase structure of the two- and three-frequency\nsine-Gordon models using the TCSA. In the case of the three-frequency model the\ntricritical point, several points of the critical line and a few points of the\nline of first order transition are found.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jun 2007 19:26:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2007 18:08:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-11-21"}

We consider the problem of approximating a function belonging\nto an arbitrary real-valued RKHS on R^d based on approximate observations of\nthe function. The observations are approximate in the sense that the actual\nobservations (i.e., the true function values) are known only to belong to a\nconvex set of admissible observations. We seek a minimax optimal approximation\nfor the function that minimizes the supremum of the RKHS norm on the error\nbetween the true function and the chosen approximation subject only to the\nconditions that the true function belongs to a uniformly bounded uncertainty\nset of functions that satisfy the constraints on the observations and that the\napproximation is a member of the RKHS. We refer to such a solution as a minimax\nrobust reconstruction. We characterize the solution to the minimax robust\nreconstruction problem and show that it is equivalent to solving a\nstraightforward convex optimization problem. We demonstrate that a minimax\nrobust reconstruction will generally be more stable than an approximation based\non interpolation through a nominal set of observations and that, subject to\nsome mild regularity conditions on the convex set of admissible observations,\nthe minimax robust reconstruction is unconditionally stable.

This inference is based on a\nstatistical approach to error correction, followed by a combinatorial algorithm\nfor constructing a minimal set of haplotypes that explain the data. Using this\nset of explaining haplotypes, we apply a statistical model to infer the\nfrequencies of the haplotypes in the population via an EM algorithm. We\ndemonstrate that pyrosequencing reads allow for effective population\nreconstruction by extensive simulations and by comparison to 165 sequences\nobtained directly from clonal sequencing of four independent, diverse HIV\npopulations. Thus, pyrosequencing can be used for cost-effective estimation of\nthe structure of virus populations, promising new insights into viral\nevolutionary dynamics and disease control strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Jul 2007 15:36:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2008 19:11:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

To physically account for the NOB deviations of\nthe Nusselt numbers from its Oberbeck-Boussinesq values, we apply the\ndecomposition of $Nu_{NOB}/Nu_{OB}$ into the product of two effects, namely\nfirst the change in the sum of the top and bottom thermal BL thicknesses, and\nsecond the shift of the center temperature $T_c$ as compared to $T_m$.

Nevertheless, as more data\nwere accumulated, deviations in the 2.5-3.5 sigma range have emerged pointing\nto the exciting possibility of new CP-odd phase(s) and flavor violating\nparameters in B-decays. Primarily this seems to be the case in the time\ndependent CP asymmetries in penguin dominated modes (e.g. B -> phi (eta') Ks).\n  We discuss these and other deviations from the SM and, as an illustration of\npossible new physics scenarios, we examine the role of the Top Two Higgs\nDoublet Model. This is a simple extension of the SM obtained by adding second\nHiggs doublet in which the Yukawa interactions of the two Higgs doublets are\nassigned in order to naturally account for the large top-quark mass.\n  Of course, many other extensions of the Standard Model could also account for\nthese experimental deviations. Clearly if one takes these deviations seriously\nthen some new particles in the 300 GeV to few TeV with associated new CP-odd\nphase(s) are needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Jul 2007 00:54:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-13"}
