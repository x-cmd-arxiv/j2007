Currently, the most promising method to detect\nWIMPs is the direct detection of the recoil energy deposited in a\nlow-background laboratory detector due to elastic WIMP-nucleus scattering. So\nfar the usual procedure has been to predict the event rate of direct detection\nof WIMPs based on some model(s) of the Galactic halo from cosmology and of\nWIMPs from elementary particle physics. The aim of this work is to invert this\nprocess. In this thesis I present methods which allow to reconstruct (the\nmoments of) the WIMP velocity distribution function as well as to determine the\nWIMP mass from the recoil energy spectrum as well as from experimental data\ndirectly. The reconstruction of the velocity distribution function has been\nfurther extended to take into account the annual modulation of the event rate.\nMoreover, the reconstruction of the amplitude of the annual modulation of the\nvelocity distribution and an alternative, better way for confirming the annual\nmodulation of the event rate have been discussed.

It has been observed that by overcoming the diffusive behavior of\nreversible chains, certain nonreversible chains lifted from reversible ones mix\nsubstantially faster than the original chains. In this paper, we investigate\nthe idea of accelerating distributed consensus via lifting Markov chains, and\npropose a class of Location-Aided Distributed Averaging (LADA) algorithms for\nwireless networks, where nodes' coarse location information is used to\nconstruct nonreversible chains that facilitate distributed computing and\ncooperative processing. First, two general pseudo-algorithms are presented to\nillustrate the notion of distributed averaging through chain-lifting. These\npseudo-algorithms are then respectively instantiated through one LADA algorithm\non grid networks, and one on general wireless networks. For a $k\\times k$ grid\nnetwork, the proposed LADA algorithm achieves an $\\epsilon$-averaging time of\n$O(k\\log(\\epsilon^{-1}))$. Based on this algorithm, in a wireless network with\ntransmission range $r$, an $\\epsilon$-averaging time of\n$O(r^{-1}\\log(\\epsilon^{-1}))$ can be attained through a centralized algorithm.\nSubsequently, we present a fully-distributed LADA algorithm for wireless\nnetworks, which utilizes only the direction information of neighbors to\nconstruct nonreversible chains. It is shown that this distributed LADA\nalgorithm achieves the same scaling law in averaging time as the centralized\nscheme. Finally, we propose a cluster-based LADA (C-LADA) algorithm, which,\nrequiring no central coordination, provides the additional benefit of reduced\nmessage complexity compared with the distributed LADA algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2007 20:47:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Jul 2008 23:54:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2009 23:40:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

While\nprevious studies of this model have focused primarily on its\nradiation-hydrodynamics aspects, in this paper, we provide an analysis of its\nX-ray spectral (continuum and possible edge and line) characteristics. Compton\nreflection between high and low density regions in the disk may provide the key\nto distinguishing this model from others, such as accretion onto an\nintermediate mass black hole. We couple a Monte Carlo/Fokker-Planck radiation\ntransport code with the XSTAR code for reflection to simulate the photon\nspectra produced in a photon bubble model for ULXs. We find that reflection\ncomponents tend to be very weak and in most cases not observable, and make\npredictions for the shape of the high-energy Comptonizing spectra. In many\ncases the Comptonization dominates the spectra even down to $\\sim$ a few keV.\nIn one simulation, a $\\sim 9 \\kev$ feature was found, which may be considered a\nsignature of photon bubbles in ULXs; furthermore, we make predictions of high\nenergy power-laws which may be observed by future instruments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2007 21:38:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

In the $0<\\gamma<2/3$\ncase, there is no sonic point and there exists a one-parameter family of\nsolutions which are {\\it genuinely} asymptotically Friedmann at large\ndistances. We find eight classes of asymptotic behavior: Friedmann or\nquasi-Friedmann or quasi-static or constant-velocity at large distances,\nquasi-Friedmann or positive-mass singular or negative-mass singular at small\ndistances, and quasi-Kantowski-Sachs at intermediate distances. The\nself-similar asymptotically quasi-static and quasi-Kantowski-Sachs solutions\nare analytically extendible and of great cosmological interest. We also\ninvestigate their conformal diagrams. The results of the present analysis are\nutilized in an accompanying paper to obtain and physically interpret numerical\nsolutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2007 02:46:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Oct 2007 01:46:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 2 Jan 2008 18:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

To gain insight into these fitness landscapes, we first use\nstandard tools such as adaptive walks and correlation length.

We assume, as optimality criterion, the achievement of a Nash\nequilibrium and consider two alternative optimization problems: 1) the\ncompetitive maximization of mutual information on each link, given constraints\non the transmit power and on the spectral mask imposed by the radio spectrum\nregulatory bodies; and 2) the competitive maximization of the transmission\nrate, using finite order constellations, under the same constraints as above,\nplus a constraint on the average error probability. In Part I of the paper, we\nstart by showing that the solution set of both noncooperative games is always\nnonempty and contains only pure strategies. Then, we prove that the optimal\nprecoding/multiplexing scheme for both games leads to a channel diagonalizing\nstructure, so that both matrix-valued problems can be recast in a simpler\nunified vector power control game, with no performance penalty. Thus, we study\nthis simpler game and derive sufficient conditions ensuring the uniqueness of\nthe Nash equilibrium. Interestingly, although derived under stronger\nconstraints, incorporating for example spectral mask constraints, our\nuniqueness conditions have broader validity than previously known conditions.\nFinally, we assess the goodness of the proposed decentralized strategy by\ncomparing its performance with the performance of a Pareto-optimal centralized\nscheme.

Using Kurucz's WIDTH9 program and the spectrum synthesis code,\nSYNSPEC, we determined the atmospheric parameters and abundances.

In addition to the observed pulsing nature\nof the radio flux from another ultra-cool source, the present observations\nsuggests that ultra-cool dwarfs may not just be pulsing but can also display\nlong-term sporadic variability in their levels of quiescent radio emission. The\nlack of optical photometric variability suggests an absence of large-scale\nspots at the time of the latest VLA observations, although small very high\nlatitude spots combined with a low inclination could cause very low amplitude\nrotational modulation which may not be measurable.

This article\nsummarises recent work in development of MEMS solutions for electrical\nmetrology. MEMS-based voltage references, RMS-to-DC converters, high frequency\npower sensors, and reference oscillators are discussed. The main principle of\noperation of the components is the balance between electrical forces and\nmechanical spring forces in micromachined silicon structures. In RMS sensors\nand RMS-to-DC converters, the quadratic voltage dependence of the force between\nplates of a moving-plate capacitor is utilised, and the operation of the MEMS\nvoltage reference is based on the pull-in phenomenon of a moving-plate\ncapacitor. Advantages of MEMS devices compared to more conventional solutions\ninclude small size, low power consumption, low price in mass production, and\nstability. The drift caused by electrostatic charging effects has turned out to\nbe a major problem. This problem has not yet been solved in DC applications,\nbut it can be circumvented by using AC actuation instead of DC and by\ncompensating the internal DC voltages of the component. In this way, an AC\nvoltage reference with relative drift rate below 2 ppm during a three-week test\nperiod has been constructed. Even better stability has been demonstrated with a\nMEMS-based reference oscillator: no changes in resonance frequency were\nobserved at relative uncertainty level of about 0.01 ppm in a measurement which\nwas continued for more than a month.
