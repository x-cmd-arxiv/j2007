Modes parallel to the field with\nwavelengths smaller than l_c = [B B/(d_h - d_l) g] are suppressed (where d_h\nand d_l are the densities of the heavy and light fluids respectively), whereas\nmodes perpendicular to B are unaffected.

Consequently, the model has no free parameters other\nthan the initial conditions at the onset of the explosion, and therefore it has\nconsiderable predictive power.

It follows\nthat there is an inter-universal medium (IUM), probably having the demand of\nnew universes in balance with the supply of dark radiation and sub-atomic\nparticles from the decaying galaxies. The mixing causes the universes to have\nthe same quantum, relativity, gravity, and particle physics as our universe.\nThe making of a universe from the radiation and sub-atomic particles occurs\nthrough re-vitalizing the protons, and other particles as well, by\ngravitational energy obtained in accretion of the IUM.

Explanations of this acceleration are of two kinds:\nmodifications of Einstein gravity or new forms of energy. An example of\nmodified gravity is the braneworld Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) model, an\nexample of dark energy is Chaplygin gas. Both are characterized by a cross-over\nlength scale $r_c$ which marks the transition between physics occurring on our\nfour-dimensional brane, and in a five-dimensional bulk space. Assuming that the\nscales $r_c$ in the two models are the same, we study Chaplygin gas dark energy\nin flat DGP geometries. The self-accelerating branch does not give a viable\nmodel, it causes too much acceleration. We derive the Hubble function and the\nluminosity distance for the self-decelerating branch, and then fit a\ncompilation of 192 SNeIa magnitudes and redshifts in the space of the three\nparameters of the model. Our model with the self-decelerating branch fits the\nsupernova data as successfully as does the $\\Lambda CDM$ model, and with only\none additional parameter. In contrast to the $\\Lambda CDM$ model, this model\nneeds no fine-tuning, and it can explain the coincidence problem. It is unique\nin the sense that it cannot be reduced to a cosmological constant model in any\nother limit of the parameter space than in the distant future. If later tests\nwith other cosmological data are successful, we have here a first indication\nthat we live in a five-dimensional braneworld.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jul 2007 12:39:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2007 10:06:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-10"}
