The ALFALFA (Arecibo Legacy\nFast ALFA) survey has completed observations of the Virgo Cluster in the\ndeclination range of 6 - 16 degrees. Less than 2% of the early-type dwarf\npopulation is detected, a significantly lower fraction than reported in\nprevious papers based on more limited samples. In contrast ~30 of the\nirregular/BCD dwarf population is detected. The detected early-type galaxies\ntend to be located in the outer regions of the cluster, with a concentration in\nthe direction of the M Cloud. Many show evidence for ongoing/recent star\nformation. Galaxies such as these may be undergoing morphological transition\ndue to cluster environmental effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jul 2007 17:33:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The\nsmall scale motions behave as Alfven waves; they cause negligible\neddy-diffusivity and contribute little to the net transport of angular\nmomentum. In our simulations we observe no sign of dynamo action, of either\nmean field or fluctuation type, up to a magnetic Reynolds number of 10^5.\nHowever the Pitts & Tayler instability is sustained as long as the differential\nrotation acting on the poloidal field is able to generate a toroidal field of\nsufficient strength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2007 08:17:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Another part of\nthe paper is devoted to active searches for relic gravitational waves in cosmic\nmicrowave background radiation (CMB). Here, the emphasis is on the\ntemperature-polarization TE cross-correlation function of CMB. The expected\nnumerical level of the correlation, its sign, statistics, and the most\nappropriate interval of angular scales are identified. Other correlation\nfunctions are also considered. The overall conclusion is such that the\nobservational discovery of relic gravitational waves looks like the matter of a\nfew coming years, rather than a few decades.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2007 15:10:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2007 15:17:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 May 2008 16:29:36 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 7 Mar 2010 22:50:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-09"}

The measured slope suggests that\nthese objects are in a radiatively inefficient accretion mode, and has been\nused to put stringent constraints on the properties of the accretion flow. We\nfound no statistically significant correlations between Bondi power and\nbolometric AGN luminosity, apart from that induced by their common dependence\non L_kin.

The\nline width at 50% of the peak intensity performs much more poorly, in large\npart because CO lines have a wide range of profiles, which are shown to vary\nsystematically with infrared luminosity.
