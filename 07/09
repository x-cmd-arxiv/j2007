A similarity between two of the comparisons leads to a new\ntheoretical picture of the bulge-disk connection in the Galaxy, where a\nsupermassive black hole resides at the center. We postulate that a metal-rich\noutflow, triggered by feedback from a black hole, was generated and quenched\nthe star formation, which had lasted several billion years in the bulge. The\nexpelled gas cooled down in the Galactic halo without escaping from the\ngravitational potential of the Galaxy. The gas gradually started to accrete to\nthe disk around five billion years ago, corresponding to the time of sun's\nbirth, and replaced a low-metallicity halo gas that had been accreting over\nnearly ten billion years. The metal-rich infalling gas, whose elemental\nabundance reflects that of metal-rich bulge stars, mixed with the interstellar\ngas already present in the disk. Stars formed from the mixture compose the\nmetal-rich stellar disk. This scheme is incorporated into models for chemical\nevolution of the disk. The resultant elemental features are compatible with the\nobserved abundance trends of metal-rich disk stars, including the upturning\nfeature exhibited in some [X/Fe] ratios, whose interpretation was theoretically\npuzzling.

The\nanalysis of the C-V plots allows also determining the height of the junction\nbarrier, the concentrations and the concentration gradient of the impurities,\nand the temperature dependence of the static dielectric constant. The\nzero-bias-resistance x area products (R0Ae) at 80 K are: 850 OHMcm2 for TDJ,\n250 OHMcm2 for In-IJ, and ~ 80 OHMcm2 for Zn-IJ, while at 180 K R0Ae ~ 0.38\nOHMcm2 for TDJ, and ~ 0.1 OHMcm2 for IJ. The estimated detectivity is: D* ~\n10^10 cmHz^(1/2)/W up to T=140 K, determined mainly by background radiation,\nwhile at T=180 K, D* decreases to 108-107 cmHz^(1/2)/W, and is determined by\nthe Johnson noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2007 09:20:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We\nshow that the long-term quenching in haloes >Mmin~7x10^12 Mo could be due to\nthe gravitational energy of cosmological accretion delivered to the inner-halo\nhot gas by cold flows via ram-pressure drag and local shocks. Mmin is obtained\nby comparing the gravitational power of infall into the potential well with the\noverall radiative cooling rate. The heating wins if the gas inner density cusp\nis not steeper than r^-0.5 and if the masses in the cold and hot phases are\ncomparable. The effect is stronger at higher redshifts, making the maintenance\neasier also at later times. Clumps >10^5 Mo penetrate to the inner halo with\nsufficient kinetic energy before they disintegrate, but they have to be <10^8\nMo for the drag to do enough work in a Hubble time. Pressure confined ~10^4K\nclumps are stable against their own gravity and remain gaseous once below the\nBonnor-Ebert mass ~10^8 Mo. They are also immune to tidal disruption. Clumps in\nthe desired mass range could emerge by thermal instability in the outer halo if\nthe conductivity is not too high. Alternatively, such clumps may be embedded in\ndark-matter subhaloes if the ionizing flux is ineffective, but they separate\nfrom their subhaloes by ram pressure before entering the inner halo. Heating by\ndynamical friction becomes dominant for massive satellites, which can\ncontribute up to one third of the total gravitational heating. We conclude that\ngravitational heating by cosmological accretion is a viable alternative to AGN\nfeedback as a long-term quenching mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2007 09:53:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2007 16:38:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

One transit of this star has been observed with GMOS-S\ninstrument of GEMINI-South telescope in i and g-bands. The measurement of the\ntransit allows us to verify that this is not a false positive, to confirm the\ntransit amplitude measured by OGLE, and to improve the ephemeris. The transit\nis well defined in i-band light curve, with a depth of A_i=0.034 mag. It is\nhowever, less well defined, but deeper (A_g=0.1 mag) in the g-band, in which\nthe star is significantly fainter. The near-infrared photometry obtained with\nSofI array at the ESO-NTT yields K=12.2+-0.1 and V-K=8.4+-0.1, so red that it\nis unlike any other transit candidate studied before. Due to the extreme nature\nof this object, we have not yet been able to measure velocities for this star,\nbut based on the new data we consider two different possible configurations:(1)\na nearby M7V star, or (2) a blend with a very reddened distant red giant. The\nnearby M7V dwarf hypothesis would give a radius for the companion of\nR_p=0.3+-0.1 R_J, i.e. the size of Neptune. Quantitative analysis of near-IR\nspectroscopy finally shows that OGLE-TR-82 is a distant, reddened metal poor\nearly K giant. This result is confirmed by direct comparison with stellar\ntemplates that gives the best match for a K3III star. Therefore, we discard the\nplanetary nature of the companion. Based on all the new data, we conclude that\nthis system is a main-sequence binary blended with a background red giant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2007 13:24:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

In high-density regions ~70% of galaxies are passive independent of\nluminosity.

Indeed for the lowest luminosity range covered (-18<Mr<-16)\nnone of the ~600 galaxies in the lowest density quartile are passive. The few\npassively-evolving dwarf galaxies in field regions appear as satellites to\nbright (~L*) galaxies. The fraction of galaxies with optical AGN signatures\ndecreases steadily from ~50% at Mr~-21 to ~0% by Mr~-18 closely mirroring the\nluminosity-dependence of the passive galaxy fraction in low-density\nenvironments. This result reflects the increasing importance of AGN feedback\nwith galaxy mass for their evolution, such that the star-formation histories of\nmassive galaxies are primarily determined by their past merger history. In\ncontrast, the complete absence of passively-evolving dwarf galaxies more than\n~2 virial radii from the nearest massive halo (i.e. cluster, group or massive\ngalaxy) indicates that internal processes, such as merging, AGN feedback or gas\nconsumption through star-formation, are not responsible for terminating\nstar-formation in dwarf galaxies.
