Using\nline-ratio diagnostics, we find that the emission is LINER-like at high\nluminosity, but driven by star-formation in low-luminosity galaxies. We use\nLick indices to characterise the absorption spectra. We define a subset of\ngalaxies with very low emission contamination, and fit the index-sigma\nrelations for this subset. Comparing the index-sigma slopes against predictions\nfrom single-burst stellar population models, we infer the scaling relations of\nage, total metallicity, [Z/H], and alpha-element abundance ratio, [a/Fe]. To\nreproduce the observed index-sigma slopes, all three parameters must increase\nwith increasing velocity dispersion. Specifically, we recover: Age \\propto\nsigma^0.52+/-0.10, Z/H \\propto sigma^0.34+/-0.07, and a/Fe \\propto\nsigma^0.23+/-0.06 (error reflects systematic effects), derived over a decade\nbaseline in velocity dispersion. The recovered age-sigma relation is shown to\nbe consistent with the observed evolution in the giant-to-dwarf galaxy ratio in\nclusters at redshifts z=0.4-0.8. A companion paper will analyse the\ndistribution of age, [Z/H] and [a/Fe] for individual galaxies.

To explore\nthis, we use high-resolution simulations of a sample of galaxy clusters\nspanning a mass range of about two orders of magnitudes, and follow\nself-consistent CR physics on top of the radiative hydrodynamics. We model CR\nelectrons that are accelerated at cosmological structure formation shocks and\nthose that are produced in hadronic interactions of CRs with ambient gas\nprotons.

One of\nthe fundamental problems in this area is bounding (asymptotically) the maximum\nlength of such sequences. Following Klazar, let Ex(\\sigma,n) be the maximum\nlength of a sequence over an alphabet of size n avoiding subsequences\nisomorphic to \\sigma. It has been proved that for every \\sigma, Ex(\\sigma,n) is\neither linear or very close to linear; in particular it is O(n\n2^{\\alpha(n)^{O(1)}}), where \\alpha is the inverse-Ackermann function and O(1)\ndepends on \\sigma. However, very little is known about the properties of \\sigma\nthat induce superlinearity of \\Ex(\\sigma,n).\n  In this paper we exhibit an infinite family of independent superlinear\nforbidden subsequences. To be specific, we show that there are 17 prototypical\nsuperlinear forbidden subsequences, some of which can be made arbitrarily long\nthrough a simple padding operation. Perhaps the most novel part of our\nconstructions is a new succinct code for representing superlinear forbidden\nsubsequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2007 22:16:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-13"}

Most of the emission line profiles of 2M1207 are broad, in particular\nthat of Halpha, indicating that the dominant fraction of the emission must be\nattributed to disk accretion rather than to magnetic activity. From the Halpha\n10% width we deduce a relatively stable accretion rate between\n10^(-10.1...-9.8) Msun/yr for two nights of consecutive observations.\nTherefore, either the accretion stream is nearly homogeneous over (sub-)stellar\nlongitude or the system is seen face-on. Small but significant variations are\nevident throughout our near-continuous observation, and they reach a maximum\nafter ~8 h, roughly the timescale on which maximum variability is expected\nacross the rotation cycle. Together with past measurements, we confirm that the\naccretion rate of 2M1207 varies by more than one order of magnitude on\ntimescales of months to years. Such variable mass accretion yields a plausible\nexplanation for the observed spread in the accretion rate vs. mass diagram. The\nmagnetic field required to drive the funnel flow is on the order of a few\nhundred G. Despite the obvious presence of a magnetic field, no radio nor X-ray\nemission has been reported for 2M1207.

This average depends on coordination number, average geometry of the\ncontact network and average contact stiffness. As far as the separate\ncontributions from particle displacements and rotations are concerned, the\nformer is found to counteract the average strain along the contact normal,\nwhile the latter do in the tangential plane.

We start by analyzing how the overlay\nproperties impact the efficiency of BitTorrent. We focus on the average peer\nset size (i.e., average number of neighbors), the time for a peer to reach its\nmaximum peer set size, and the diameter of the overlay. In particular, we show\nthat the later a peer arrives in a torrent, the longer it takes to reach its\nmaximum peer set size. Then, we evaluate the impact of the maximum peer set\nsize, the maximum number of outgoing connections per peer, and the number of\nNATed peers on the overlay properties. We show that BitTorrent generates a\nrobust overlay, but that this overlay is not a random graph. In particular, the\nconnectivity of a peer to its neighbors depends on its arriving order in the\ntorrent. We also show that a large number of NATed peers significantly\ncompromise the robustness of the overlay to attacks. Finally, we evaluate the\nimpact of peer exchange on the overlay properties, and we show that it\ngenerates a chain-like overlay with a large diameter, which will adversely\nimpact the efficiency of large torrents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2007 15:38:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-13"}
