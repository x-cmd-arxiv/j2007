This high mass transfer rate has been suggested to be\ncaused by dynamical instability, expected when the donor star is more massive\nthan the accreting object. When the orbital period is smaller than ~6 hours,\nthis mechanism does not work and the CBSS with such periods are believed to be\nfed by a distinct mechanism: the wind-driven accretion. Such a mechanism has\nbeen proposed to explain the properties of objects like SMC 13, T Pyx and V617\nSgr. One observational property that offers a critical test for discriminating\nbetween the above two possibilities is the orbital period change. As systems\nwith wind-driven accretion evolve with increasing periods, some of them may\nreach quite long orbital periods. The above critical test may, therefore, also\nbe applied to orbital periods longer than 6 hours.

Brownian motion is one such model,\nand since rates cannot become negative, a log Brownian model seems appropriate.\nDivergence time estimates can then be made using weighted least squares\npenalties. As sequences become long, this approach effectively becomes\nequivalent to penalized likelihood or Bayesian approaches. Different forms of\nthe least squares penalty are considered to take into account correlation due\nto shared ancestors. It is shown that a scale parameter is also needed since\nthe sum of squares changes with the scale of time. Errors or uncertainty on\nfossil calibrations, may be folded in with errors due to the stochastic nature\nof Brownian motion and ancestral polymorphism, giving a total sum of squares to\nbe minimized.

All models assume diploid organisms whose genomes consist of\ntwo chromosomes, each of which is taken to be functional if equal to some\nmaster sequence, and defective otherwise. In the asexual population, the\nasexual diploid spores develop directly into adult organisms. In the sexual\npopulations, the haploid gametes enter a haploid pool, where they may fuse with\nother haploids.

Through a computational study, in this paper we show\nthat networks with fewer independent negative feedback loops tend to exhibit\nmore regular behavior than those with more negative loops. To be precise, we\nstudy the relationship between the number of independent feedback loops and the\nnumber and length of the limit cycles in the phase space of dynamic Boolean\nnetworks. We show that, as the number of independent negative feedback loops\nincreases, the number (length) of limit cycles tends to decrease (increase).\nThese conclusions are consistent with the fact, for certain natural biological\nnetworks, that they on the one hand exhibit generally regular behavior and on\nthe other hand show less negative feedback loops than randomized networks with\nthe same numbers of nodes and connectivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2007 23:46:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2007 17:45:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

This results in a\nlarger solution space that incorporates an exact analytic solution for the\nnon-central electric dipole potential cos(theta)/r^2, which was known not to\nbelong to the class of exactly solvable potentials. As a result, we were able\nto obtain an exact analytic solution of the three-dimensional time-independent\nSchrodinger equation for a charged particle in the field of a point electric\ndipole that could carry a nonzero net charge. This problem models the\ninteraction of an electron with a molecule (neutral or ionized) that has a\npermanent electric dipole moment. The solution is written as a series of square\nintegrable functions that support a tridiagonal matrix representation for the\nangular and radial components of the wave operator. Moreover, this solution is\nfor all energies, the discrete (for bound states) as well as the continuous\n(for scattering states). The expansion coefficients of the radial and angular\ncomponents of the wavefunction are written in terms of orthogonal polynomials\nsatisfying three-term recursion relations. For the Coulomb-free case, where the\nmolecule is neutral, we calculate critical values for its dipole moment below\nwhich no electron capture is allowed.

In this work, we analize and discuss data for a\nsample of Galactic and extragalactic HII regions where this abundance\ndiscrepancy has been determined. We find that the abundance discrepancy factor\n(ADF) is fairly constant and of the order of 2 in all the available sample of\nHII regions. This is a rather different behaviour than that observed in\nplanetary nebulae, where the ADF shows a much wider range of values. We do not\nfind correlations between the ADF and the O/H, O++/H+ ratios, the ionization\ndegree, Te(High), Te(Low)/ Te(High), FWHM, and the effective temperature of the\nmain ionizing stars within the observational uncertainties. These results\nindicate that whatever mechanism is producing the abundance discrepancy in HII\nregions it does not substantially depend on those nebular parameters. On the\ncontrary, the ADF seems to be slightly dependent on the excitation energy, a\nfact that is consistent with the predictions of the classical temperature\nfluctuations paradigm. Finally, we obtain that Te values obtained from OII\nrecombination lines in HII regions are in agreement with those obtained from\ncollisionally excited line ratios, a behaviour that is again different from\nthat observed in planetary nebulae. These similar temperature determinations\nare in contradiction with the predictions of the model based on the presence of\nchemically inhomogeneous clumps but are consistent with the temperature\nfluctuations paradigm. We conclude that all the indications suggest that the\nphysical mechanism responsible of the abundance discrepancy in HII regions and\nplanetary nebulae are different.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2007 10:23:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

This\nis in contrast to the assumption of hole doping into planar Cu dx2-y2 and O\npsigma orbitals as in the t-J model. Interaction of holes with the d9 spin\nbackground leads to chiral polarons with either a clockwise or anti-clockwise\ncharge current.

Spin\nexchange Coulomb repulsion with chiral polarons leads to D-wave\nsuperconductivity. The equivalent of the Debye energy in phonon\nsuperconductivity is the maximum energy separation between a chiral polaron and\nits time-reversed partner. An additive skew-scattering contribution to the Hall\neffect is induced by chiral polarons and leads to a temperature dependent Hall\neffect that fits the measured values for LaSrCuO.

In\nparticular, large deviations from the sample mean are expected to be strongly\naffected by such nonlinearities. Here we apply a newly developed nonlinear\ntechnique (Maxima of Cumulant Function, MCF) for the detection of typical\nspatial patterns that largely deviate from the mean. In order to test the\ntechnique and to introduce the methodology, we focus on the El Nino/Southern\nOscillation and its spatial patterns. We find nonsymmetric temperature patterns\ncorresponding to El Nino and La Nina, and we compare the results of MCF with\nother techniques, such as the symmetric solutions of PCA, and the nonsymmetric\nsolutions of Nonlinear PCA (NLPCA). We found that MCF solutions are more\nreliable than the NLPCA fits, and can capture mixtures of principal components.\nFinally, we apply Extreme Value Theory on the temporal variations extracted\nfrom our methodology. We find that the tails of the distribution of extreme\ntemperatures during La Nina episodes is bounded, while the tail during El Ninos\nis less likely to be bounded. This implies that the mean spatial patterns of\nthe two phases are asymmetric, as well as the behaviour of their extremes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2007 14:53:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

The functional\nforms of these terms are based on the effective yield criterion recently\ndeveloped on the basis of atomistic modeling of the glide of screw dislocations\nat 0 K. The minimum energy path between two potential minima, and thus the\ncorresponding activation barrier, is obtained using the Nudged Elastic Band\nmethod. The constructed Peierls barrier reproduces correctly both the\nwell-known twinning-antitwinning asymmetry observed for pure shear parallel to\nthe slip direction and the effect of shear stresses perpendicular to the slip\ndirection. This advancement introduces for the first time the effect of both\nshear stresses parallel and perpendicular to the slip direction into the model\nof thermally activated dislocation motion. Based on this model we formulate a\ngeneral yield criterion that includes not only the full stress tensor but also\neffects of temperature and strain rate.
