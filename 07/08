It is\nimportant to investigate the actual performance of these dynamical decoupling\nstrategies in real systems that are promising qubit candidates.

We find that each level of concatenation reverses\nthe effect of successive levels of intrabath fluctuations. On the one hand,\nthis advances CDD as a versatile and realistic decoupling strategy.

In this\nwork we consider a parallel relay network with noise correlation. For the relay\nstrategy of amplify-and-forward (AF), we determine the optimal rate maximizing\nrelay gains when correlation knowledge is available at the relays. The effect\nof correlation on the performance of the relay networks is analyzed for the\ncases where full knowledge of correlation is available at the relays and when\nthere is no knowledge about the correlation structure. Interestingly we find\nthat, on the average, noise correlation is beneficial regardless of whether the\nrelays know the noise covariance matrix or not. However, the knowledge of\ncorrelation can greatly improve the performance. Typically, the performance\nimprovement from correlation knowledge increases with the relay power and the\nnumber of relays. With perfect correlation knowledge the system is capable of\ncanceling interference if the number of interferers is less than the number of\nrelays.\n  For a dual-hop multiple access parallel network, we obtain closed form\nexpressions for the maximum sum-rate and the optimal relay strategy. The relay\noptimization for networks with three hops is also considered. For any relay\ngains for the first stage relays, this represents a parallel relay network with\ncorrelated noise. Based on the result of two hop networks with noise\ncorrelation, we propose an algorithm for solving the relay optimization problem\nfor three-hop networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jul 2007 18:43:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-13"}

To\nderive the generalized virial theorem we use a method based on the\ncollisionless Boltzmann equation. The dark radiation term generates an\nequivalent mass term (the dark mass), which gives an effective contribution to\nthe gravitational energy. This term may account for the well-known virial\ntheorem mass discrepancy in actual clusters of galaxies. An approximate\nsolution of the vacuum field equations on the brane, corresponding to weak\ngravitational fields, is also obtained, and the expressions for the dark\nradiation and dark mass are derived.

In the low\nmobility regime the classical Hall resistance line is proportional to the\nmagnetic field as measured in the high temperature limit and cuts through the\ncenter of each Hall plateau. For high mobility samples we observe in linear\nresponse measurements, that this symmetry is broken and the classical Hall line\ncuts the plateaus not at the center but at higher magnetic fields near the\nedges of the plateaus.
