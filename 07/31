The three perturbations, which later in the isotropic regime\nbecome a scalar mode and two tensor polarizations (gravitational wave), are\ncoupled to each other already at the linearized level during the anisotropic\nphase. This generates nonvanishing correlations between different modes of the\nCMB anisotropies, which can be particularly relevant at large scales (and,\npotentially, be related to the large scale anomalies in the WMAP data). As an\nexample, we compute the spectrum of the perturbations in this Bianchi I\ngeometry, assuming that the inflaton is in a slow roll regime also in the\nanisotropic phase.

There is nothing anomalous\nwith colour--magnitude diagrams on opposite sides of the average warp mid-plane\nbeing different. We witnessed the rise and fall of the blue plume population,\nfirst attributed to young stars in a disrupting dwarf galaxy and now discarded\nas a normal disc population. Similarly, there is nothing anomalous in the outer\nthin+thick disc metallicities being low (-1<[Fe/H]<-0.5), and spiral arms (as\npart of the thin disc) should, and do, warp. Most importantly, we show\nunambiguously that, contrary to previous claims, the warp produces a stellar\noverdensity that is distance-compatible with that observed in CMa.The CMa\nover-density remains fully accounted for in a first order approach by Galactic\nmodels without new substructures. Given the intrinsic uncertainties (concerning\nthe properties of the warp, flare and disc cutoff, the role of extinction and\ndegeneracy), minor deviations with respect to these models are not enough to\nsupport the hypothesis of an accreted dwarf galaxy or new substructure within\nthe Milky Way disc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2007 16:47:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We report two new detections of H2 at z = 2.402 and 1.989\ntoward, respectively, HE 0027-1836 and HE 2318-1107. We also present a detailed\nanalysis of our recent H2 detection toward Q2343+125. All three systems have\nlow molecular fractions, log f < -4, with f = 2N(H2)/(2N(H2) + N(HI)). Only one\nsuch H2 system was known previously. The depletion patterns for Si, S, Ti, Cr,\nMn, Fe and Ni in the three systems are found to be very similar to what is\nobserved in diffuse gas of the Galactic halo. H2 absorption from rotational\nlevels up to J = 5 is observed in a single component toward HE 0027-1836. We\nshow that the width (Doppler parameter) of the H2 lines increases with\nincreasing J and that the kinetic energy derived from the Doppler parameter is\nlinearly dependent on the relative energy of the rotational levels. The\nexcitation temperature is found to be 90 K for J = 0 to J = 2 and ~500 K for\nhigher J levels. Single isothermal PDR models fail to reproduce the observed\nrotational excitations. A two-component model is needed: one component of low\ndensity (~50 cm-3) with weak illumination (chi = 1) to explain the J <= 2\nrotational levels and another of high density (~500 cm-3) with strong\nillumination (chi = 30) for J >= 3 levels. However, the juxtaposition of these\ntwo PDR components may be ad-hoc and the multicomponent structure could result\neither from turbulent dissipation or C-shocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2007 20:25:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Moreover, using a perturbation\nresult due to Smith and Waltman, we show that this steady state also preserves\nglobal stability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2007 23:03:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-08-01"}

The mechanism by which spin-up is regulated as\nyoung stars contract has been one of the longest-standing problems in star\nformation. Attempts to observationally confirm the prevailing theory that\nmagnetic interaction between the star and its circumstellar disk regulates\nthese rotation periods have produced mixed results. In this paper, we use the\nunprecedented disk identification capability of the Spitzer Space Telescope to\ntest the star-disk interaction paradigm in two young clusters, NGC 2264 and the\nOrion Nebula Cluster (ONC).

PR satisfies Einstein's field equations. Theory allows every two\nbody system to deviate differently from the flat Minkowski metric. PR differs\nfrom general relativity (GR) in predictions of the proper time intervals of\ndistant objects. PR proposes a definite connection between the proper time\ninterval of an object and Doppler frequency shift of its constituent particles\nas the object makes a relative motion with respect to the rest frame of the\ncoordinate time. This is because fundamentally time is periodic in nature.\nCoordinate and proper time in GR are linear time. Periodic time of PR is the\nkey parameter in development of quantum gravity theory in which the universe\nbegins with a quantum fluctuation in the fundamental substance of the universe\nwhich is infinite, motionless and indivisible. PR is based on the dynamic weak\nequivalence principle which equates the gravitational mass with the\nrelativistic mass. PR provides accurate solutions for the rotation curves of\ngalaxies and the energy levels of the Hydrogen spectra including Lamb shift\nusing common formalism. Flat space time with Lorentz invariant acceleration\npresented here makes it possible to unite PR with quantum mechanics.

In\norder to understand the origin of the observed lower velocity dispersions of\nUCDs, we numerically investigate line-of-sight velocity dispersion (sigma_los)\nof galaxy populations with variously different orbits in clusters of galaxies\nwith the total masses of M_cl. We particularly investigate radial velocity\ndispersion profiles (sigma_los(R)) and velocity dispersions within the central\n200 kpc of a cluster model (sigma_m) for galaxies with different pericenter\ndistances (r_p) and orbital eccentricities (e) in the model with M_cl = 7.0 x\n10^13 M_sun reasonable for the Fornax cluster.

I compile\nobservational estimates of the fraction eta of intermediate-mass stars that\neventually explode as SNe-Ia, supplement them with several new estimates, and\ncompare them self-consistently. The estimates are based on five different\nmethods, each utilising some observable related to the SN-Ia rate, combined\nwith assumptions regarding the IMF: the ratio of SN-Ia to core-collapse rates\nin star-forming galaxies; the SN-Ia rate per unit star-formation rate; the\nSN-Ia rate per unit stellar mass; the iron to stellar mass ratio in galaxy\nclusters; and the abundance ratios in galaxy clusters. The five methods\nindicate that a fraction in the range eta~2-40% of all stars with initial\nmasses of 3-8 M_sun (the generally assumed SN-Ia progenitors) explode as\nSNe-Ia. A fraction of eta~15% is consistent with all five methods for a range\nof plausible IMFs. Considering also the binarity fraction among such stars, the\nmass ratio distribution, the separation distribution, and duplicity (every\nbinary can produce only one SN-Ia explosion), this implies that nearly every\nintermediate mass close binary ends up as a SN-Ia, or possibly more SNe-Ia than\nprogenitor systems. Theoretically expected fractions are generally one to two\norders of magnitude lower. The problem could be solved: if all the\nobservational estimates are in error; or with a ``middle-heavy'' IMF; or by\nsome mechanism that strongly enhances the efficiency of binary evolution toward\nSN-Ia explosion; or by a non-binary origin for SNe-Ia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2007 12:10:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2007 11:07:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The behavior of $G$ depends on two parameters, the equation\nof state $\\omega$ and $\\epsilon,$ a parameter that controls the behavior of\n$c(t),$ therefore $G$ may be growing or decreasing.We also show that through\nthe Lie method, there is no difference between to study the field equations\nunder the assumption of a $c-$var affecting to the curvature tensor which the\nother one where it is not considered such effects.Nevertheless, it is essential\nto consider such effects in the cases studied under the SS, MC, and KSS\nhypotheses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2007 15:16:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Apr 2008 06:51:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

In\nthe first step, a combination of two methods is used to identify the centers of\npotential groups and to estimate their characteristic luminosity. Using an\niterative approach, the adaptive group finder then uses the average\nmass-to-light ratios of groups, obtained from the previous iteration, to assign\na tentative mass to each group. This mass is then used to estimate the size and\nvelocity dispersion of the underlying halo that hosts the group, which in turn\nis used to determine group membership in redshift space. Finally, each\nindividual group is assigned two different halo masses: one based on its\ncharacteristic luminosity, and the other based on its characteristic stellar\nmass. Applying the group finder to the SDSS DR4, we obtain 301237 groups in a\nbroad dynamic range, including systems of isolated galaxies. We use detailed\nmock galaxy catalogues constructed for the SDSS DR4 to test the performance of\nour group finder in terms of completeness of true members, contamination by\ninterlopers, and accuracy of the assigned masses. This paper is the first in a\nseries and focuses on the selection procedure, tests of the reliability of the\ngroup finder, and the basic properties of the group catalogue (e.g. the\nmass-to-light ratios, the halo mass to stellar mass ratios, etc.).

Stars at a given effective temperature have a spread in their\ngeometrically estimated projected radii that is larger than can be accounted\nfor with a coeval model, observational uncertainties and randomly oriented\nrotation axes. It is shown that the required dispersion in radius (a factor of\n2-3 full width half maximum) can be modelled in terms of a spread in stellar\nages larger than the median age of the cluster, although the detailed star\nformation history cannot be uniquely determined using present data. This\ntechnique is relatively free from systematic uncertainties (binarity,\nextinction, variability, distance) that have hampered previous studies of the\nONC star formation history using the conventional Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.\nHowever, the current ONC rotational data are biased against low luminosity\nobjects, so the deduced dispersions in radius and inferred age are probably\nunderestimates. In particular, the ages of a tail of PMS stars that appear to\nbe >=10Myr old in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram cannot be verified with\npresent data. If projected equatorial velocities were measured for these\nobjects it could easily be checked whether their radii are correspondingly\nsmaller than the bulk of the ONC population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2007 15:21:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
