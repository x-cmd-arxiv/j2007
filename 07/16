These events can be explained as\nthe prompt collapse to a black hole (BH) of the core of a massive star (M ~ 40\nMsun) that had lost its outer hydrogen and helium envelopes. All these SNe\nexhibited strong oxygen lines, and their energies were much larger than those\nof typical SNe, thus these SNe are called Hypernovae (HNe). The case of SN\n2006aj/GRB060218 appears different: the GRB was weak and soft (an X-Ray Flash,\nXRF); the SN is dimmer and has very weak oxygen lines. The explosion energy of\nSN 2006aj was smaller, as was the ejected mass. In our model, the progenitor\nstar had a smaller mass than other GRB/SNe (M ~ 20 Msun), suggesting that a\nneutron star (NS) rather than a black hole was formed. If the nascent neutron\nstar was strongly magnetized (a so-called magnetar) and rapidly spinning, it\nmay launch a weak GRB or an XRF.

The source active region has a conspicuous sigmoid\nstructure at TRACE 171 A channel as well as in the SXI soft X-ray images, and\nwe mainly concern ourselves with the detailed process of the sigmoid eruption\nas evidenced by the multiwavelength data ranging from Halpha, WL, EUV/UV,\nradio, and hard X-rays (HXRs). The most important finding is that the flare\nbrightening starts in the core of the active region earlier than that of the\nrising motion of the flux rope. This timing clearly addresses one of the main\nissues in the magnetic eruption onset of sigmoid, namely, whether the eruption\nis initiated by an internal tether-cutting to allow the flux rope to rise\nupward or a flux rope rises due to a loss of equilibrium to later induce tether\ncutting below it. Our high time cadence SXI and Halpha data shows that the\nfirst scenario is relevant to this eruption. As other major findings, we have\nthe RHESSI HXR images showing a change of the HXR source from a confined\nfootpoint structure to an elongated ribbon-like structure after the flare\nmaximum, which we relate to the sigmoid-to-arcade evolution. Radio dynamic\nspectrum shows a type II precursor that occurred at the time of expansion of\nthe sigmoid and a drifting pulsating structure in the flare rising phase in\nHXR. Finally type II and III bursts are seen at the time of maximum HXR\nemission, simultaneous with the maximum reconnection rate derived from the\nflare ribbon motion in UV.

These supersonic winds are influenced by the reverse shock from the\npreceding supernova ejecta, forming the wind termination shock. We investigate\nthe effects of the termination shock in neutrino-driven winds and its roll on\nthe r-process. Supersonic outflows are calculated with a semi-analytic\nneutrino-driven wind model. Subsequent termination-shocked, subsonic outflows\nare obtained by applying the Rankine-Hugoniot relations. We find a couple of\neffects that can be relevant for the r-process. First is the sudden slowdown of\nthe temperature decrease by the wind termination. Second is the entropy jump by\ntermination-shock heating, up to several 100NAk. Nucleosynthesis calculations\nin the obtained winds are performed to examine these effects on the r-process.\nWe find that 1) the slowdown of the temperature decrease plays a decisive roll\nto determine the r-process abundance curves. This is due to the strong\ndependences of the nucleosynthetic path on the temperature during the r-process\nfreezeout phase. Our results suggest that only the termination-shocked winds\nwith relatively small shock radii (~500km) are relevant for the bulk of the\nsolar r-process abundances (A~100-180).

The observational data indicate a strong correlation between the polar\nfield at a sunspot minimum and the strength of the next cycle, although the\nstrength of the cycle is not correlated well with the polar field produced at\nits end. This suggests that the Babcock Leighton mechanism of poloidal field\ngeneration from decaying sunspots involves randomness, whereas the other\naspects of the dynamo process must be reasonably ordered and deterministic.\nOnly if the magnetic diffusivity within the convection zone is assumed to be\nhigh, we can explain the correlation between the polar field at a minimum and\nthe next cycle. We give several independent arguments that the diffusivity must\nbe of this order. In a dynamo model with diffusivity like this, the poloidal\nfield generated at the mid latitudes is advected toward the poles by the\nmeridional circulation and simultaneously diffuses towards the tachocline,\nwhere the toroidal field for the next cycle is produced. To model actual solar\ncycles with a dynamo model having such high diffusivity, we have to feed the\nobservational data of the poloidal field at the minimum into the theoretical\nmodel. We develop a method of doing this in a systematic way. Our model\npredicts that cycle 24 will be a very weak cycle.

We consider\nspecifically a self-gravitating radiation (q=1/3), the core of neutron stars\n(q=1/3) and a gas of baryons interacting through a vector meson field (q=1). We\nstudy how the thermodynamical parameters scale with the size of the object and\nfind unusual behaviours due to the non-extensivity of the system. We compare\nthese scaling laws with the area scaling of the black hole entropy. We also\ndetermine the domain of validity of these scaling laws by calculating the\ncritical radius above which relativistic stars described by a linear equation\nof state become dynamically unstable. For photon stars, we show that the\ncriteria of dynamical and thermodynamical stability coincide. Considering\nfinite spheres, we find that the mass and entropy as a function of the central\ndensity present damped oscillations. We give the critical value of the central\ndensity, corresponding to the first mass peak, above which the series of\nequilibria becomes unstable.

First we show that when\nthe thickness of the non-magnetic (NM) spacer is in the technology relevant\nregion h ~ 10 nm, magnetodipolar interaction between 90o Neel domain walls in\nFM layers qualitatively changes the equilibrium magnetization state of these\nlayers. In the main of the paper we compare the magnetization dynamics induced\nby a sub-nsec field pulse in a single-layer Ni80Fe20 (Py) element and in the\nCo/Cu/Py trilayer element. Here we show that (i) due to the spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking of the Landau state in the FM/NM/FM trilayer its domains and\ndomain walls oscillate with different frequencies and have different spatial\noscillation patterns; (ii) magnetization oscillations of the trilayer domains\nare strongly suppressed due to different oscillation frequencies of domains in\nCo and Py; (iii) magnetization dynamics qualitatively depends on the relative\nrotation sense of magnetization states in Co and Py layers and on the\nmagnetocrystalline anisotropy kind of Co crystallites. Finally we discuss the\nrelation of our findings with experimental observations of magnetization\ndynamics in magnetic trilayers, performed using the element-specific\ntime-resolved X-ray microscopy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2007 15:53:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In order to understand the\nincreased SF rates in intermediate redshift galaxies one possibility is to\nstudy star formation in local galaxies with properties frequently found at this\nearlier epoch like low metallicity and small size. We present sensitive\nobservations of the molecular gas in M 33, a small Local Group spiral at a\ndistance of 840 kpc which shares many of the characteristics of the\nintermediate redshift galaxies. The observations were carried out in the\nCO(2--1) line with the HERA heterodyne array on the IRAM 30 m telescope. A\n11\\arcmin$\\times$22\\arcmin region in the northern part of M 33 was observed,\nreaching a detection threshold of a few 10$^{3}$ \\msol. The correlation in this\nfield between the CO emission and tracers of SF (8\\mum, 24\\mum, \\Ha, FUV) is\nexcellent and CO is detected very far North, showing that molecular gas forms\nfar out in the disk even in a small spiral with a subsolar metallicity. One\nmajor molecular cloud was discovered in an interarm region with no HI peak and\nlittle if any signs of SF -- without a complete survey this cloud would never\nhave been found. The radial dependence of the CO emission has a scale length\nsimilar to the dust emission, less extended than the \\Ha or FUV. If, however,\nthe $\\ratioo$ ratio varies inversely with metallicity, then the scale length of\nthe H$_2$ becomes similar to that of the \\Ha or FUV. Comparing the SF rate to\nthe H$_2$ mass shows that M 33, like the intermediate redshift galaxies it\nresembles, has a significantly higher SF efficiency than large local universe\nspirals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2007 15:54:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
