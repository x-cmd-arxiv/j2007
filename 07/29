These properties\ninclude the potential vorticity of the GRS and its neighboring jet streams, the\nshear imposed on the GRS by the jet streams, and the vertical entropy gradient\n(i.e., Rossby deformation radius). The cloud cover of the GRS, which is often\nused to define the GRS's area and aspect ratio, is found to differ\nsignificantly from the region of the GRS's potential vorticity anomaly. The\nwestward-going jet stream to the north of the GRS and the eastward-going jet\nstream to its south are each found to have a large potential vorticity\n``jump''. The jumps have opposite sign and as a consequence of their\ninteraction with the GRS, the shear imposed on the GRS is reduced. The\neast-west to north-south aspect ratio of the GRS's potential vorticity anomaly\ndepends on the ratio of the imposed shear to the strength of the anomaly. The\naspect ratio is found to be $\\approx$2:1, but without the opposing jumps it\nwould be much greater. The GRS's high-speed collar and quiescent interior\nrequire that the potential vorticity in the interior be approximately half that\nin the collar. No other persistent geophysical vortex has a significant minimum\nof potential vorticity in its interior and laboratory vortices with such a\nminimum are unstable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Jul 2007 00:02:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2007 02:42:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-10"}

Using several spectral classification diagrams we show that the brightest\nPN candidate (PN7) is not a PN, but rather a compact HII region consisting of\ntwo components with low electron number densities. After the rejection of this\nPN candidate, the IC10 planetary nebula luminosity function cutoff becomes very\nclose to the standard value. With the compiled spectroscopic data for a large\nnumber of extragalactic PNe, we analyse a series of diagnostic diagrams to\ngenerate quantitative criteria for separating PNe from unresolved HII regions.\nWe show that, with the help of the diagnostic diagrams and the derived set of\ncriteria, PNe can be distinguished from HII regions with an efficiency of\n~99.6%. With the obtained spectroscopic data we confirm that another, 1.7 mag\nfainter PN candidate (PN9) is a genuine PN. We argue that, based on all\ncurrently available PNe data, IC10 is located at a distance 725+63-33 kpc\n(distance modulus (m-M) = 24.30+0.18-0.10).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Jul 2007 11:01:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
