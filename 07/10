A central unit,\nhaving access to the data gathered by a dense network of fixed-precision\nsensors, operating under stringent inter-node communication constraints, is\nrequired to reconstruct the field snapshots to maximum accuracy. Both\ndeterministic and stochastic field models are considered. For stochastic\nfields, results are established in the almost-sure sense. The feasibility of\nhaving a flexible tradeoff between the oversampling rate (sensor density) and\nthe analog-to-digital converter (ADC) precision, while achieving an exponential\naccuracy in the number of bits per Nyquist-interval per snapshot is\ndemonstrated. This exposes an underlying ``conservation of bits'' principle:\nthe bit-budget per Nyquist-interval per snapshot (the rate) can be distributed\nalong the amplitude axis (sensor-precision) and space (sensor density) in an\nalmost arbitrary discrete-valued manner, while retaining the same (exponential)\ndistortion-rate characteristics.

The\nmorphological parameters demonstrate strong variations along the Hubble\nsequence, including statistically significant differences between S0/a-Sab and\nSc-Sd galaxies. Early-type galaxies are generally found to be compact,\ncentralized, symmetric sources in the 24 micron band, while late-type galaxies\nare generally found to be extended, asymmetric sources. These results suggest\nthat the processes that increase the real or apparent sizes of galaxies' bulges\nalso lead to more centralized 24 micron dust emission. Several phenomena, such\nas strong nuclear star formation, Seyfert activity, or outer ring structures,\nmay cause galaxies to deviate from the general morphological trends observed at\n24 microns.

Early studies showed\nthat bistability occurs during growth on TMG/succinate and lactose + glucose,\nbut not during growth on lactose. More recent studies with lacGFP-transfected\ncells show bistability with TMG/succinate, but not with lactose and lactose +\nglucose. In the literature, these results are attributed to variations of the\npositive feedback generated by induction. Specifically, during growth on\nTMG/succinate, induction generates positive feedback because the permease\nstimulates the accumulation of TMG, which, in turn, promotes the synthesis of\nmore permease. This positive feedback is attenuated during growth on lactose\nbecause hydrolysis of lactose by galactosidase suppresses the stimulatory\neffect of the permease. But the stabilizing effect of dilution also changes\ndramatically as a function of the medium composition. For instance, during\ngrowth on TMG/succinate, the dilution rate of the permease is proportional to\nits activity, $e$, because the specific growth rate is independent of $e$.\nHowever, during growth on lactose, the permease dilution rate is proportional\nto $e^2$ because the specific growth rate is proportional to the specific\nlactose uptake rate, which in turn, proportional to $e$. Here, we show that:\n(a) This dependence on $e^2$ creates such a strong stabilizing effect that\nbistability is virtually impossible during growth on lactose, even in the face\nof positive feedback. (b) This stabilizing effect is weakened during growth on\nlactose + glucose because the specific growth rate on glucose is independent of\n$e$, so that the dilution rate once again contains a term that is proportional\nto $e$.

The self-regulating\nmechanism is based on the interplay of two effects. First, plasma density\ncontrols coronal energy release via the transition between the slow collisional\nSweet-Parker regime and the fast collisionless reconnection regime. This\ntransition takes place when the Sweet--Parker layer becomes thinner than the\ncharacteristic collisionless reconnection scale. I present a simple criterion\nfor this transition in terms of the upstream plasma density (n_e), the\nreconnecting (B_0) and guide (B_z) magnetic field components, and the global\nlength (L) of the reconnection layer: L < 6.10^9 cm [n_e/(10^{10}/cm^3)]^(-3)\n(B_0/30G)^4 (B_0/B_z)^2. Next, coronal energy release by reconnection raises\nthe ambient plasma density via chromospheric evaporation and this, in turn,\ntemporarily inhibits subsequent reconnection involving the newly-reconnected\nloops. Over time, however, radiative cooling gradually lowers the density again\nbelow the critical value and fast reconnection again becomes possible. As a\nresult, the density is highly inhomogeneous and intermittent but,\nstatistically, does not deviate strongly from the critical value which is\ncomparable with the observed coronal density. Thus, in the long run, the\ncoronal heating process can be represented by repeating cycles that consist of\nfast reconnection events (i.e., nanoflares), followed by rapid evaporation\nepisodes, followed by relatively long periods (1-hour) during which magnetic\nstresses build up and simultaneously the plasma cools down and precipitates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2007 19:42:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2007 18:22:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-11"}

These\ngiant cells at lower latitudes exhibit prograde propagation relative to the\nmean zonal flow, or differential rotation, that they establish, and retrograde\npropagation of more isotropic structures with vortical character at mid and\nhigh latitudes. The interstices of the downflow networks often possess strong\nand compact cyclonic flows.

Indeed, the meandering streams and varying\ncellular subsurface flows revealed by helioseismology must be sampling\ncontributions from the giant cells, yet it is difficult to separate out these\nsignals from those attributed to the faster horizontal flows of\nsupergranulation.

This generalization was successful from the mathematical\npoint of view because these tensors share mathematical properties which are\nremarkably similar to those of the energy-momentum tensor of electromagnetism.\nHowever, the physical role of these tensors in General Relativity has remained\nobscure and no interpretation has achieved wide acceptance. In principle, they\ncannot represent {\\em energy} and the term {\\em superenergy} has been coined\nfor the hypothetical physical magnitude lying behind them. In this work we try\nto shed light on the true physical meaning of {\\em superenergy} by following\nthe same procedure which enables us to give an interpretation of the\nelectromagnetic energy. This procedure consists in performing an orthogonal\nsplitting of the Bel and Bel-Robinson tensors and analysing the different parts\nresulting from the splitting. In the electromagnetic case such splitting gives\nrise to the electromagnetic {\\em energy density}, the Poynting vector and the\nelectromagnetic stress tensor, each of them having a precise physical\ninterpretation which is deduced from the {\\em dynamical laws} of\nelectromagnetism (Poynting theorem). The full orthogonal splitting of the Bel\nand Bel-Robinson tensors is more complex but, as expected, similarities with\nelectromagnetism are present. Also the covariant divergence of the Bel tensor\nis analogous to the covariant divergence of the electromagnetic energy-momentum\ntensor and the orthogonal splitting of the former is found. The ensuing {\\em\nequations} are to the superenergy what the Poynting theorem is to\nelectromagnetism.

These\nstudies are based on the coexistence, in dioctahedral micas or smectites, of\nseveral cationic pairs around the hydroxyl group which each produce a\ncharacteristic band in the IR spectrum. The aim of this work is to obtain the\nwavenumber values of the IR OH vibration bands of the (Al-Fe3+)-OH and\n(Fe3+-Fe3+)-OH local cationic environments of 'pyrophyllite type' in order to\nprove, disprove or modify a model of dioctahedral phyllosilicate OH-stretching\nband decomposition. Natural samples are characterized by powder X-ray\ndiffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopies\nand electron microprobe; the hydrothermal synthesis products are also analysed\nby powder XRD and FTIR after inductively coupled plasma measurements to obtain\nthe chemical compositions of nascent gel phases. Natural samples contain some\nimpurities which were eliminated after acid treatment; nevertheless, a small Fe\ncontent is found in the pyrophyllite structure. The amount of Fe which is\nincorporated within the pyrophyllite structure is much more important for the\nsynthetic samples than for the natural ones. The IR OH bands were clearly\nobserved in both natural and synthetic pyrophyllites and assigned to hydroxides\nbonded to (Al-Al), (Al-Fe) and (Fe-Fe) cationic pairs. During this study, three\nsamples were analysed by DTG to check the cis- or trans-vacant character of the\nlayers and to determine the influence of this structural character on the\nOH-stretching band position in IR spectroscopy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2007 15:45:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-11"}
