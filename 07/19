We characterize\nproperties of these cycles and their place in the regulatory mechanism of the\ncell. Almost all cycles in the transcription network of S. cerevisiae are\ncontained in a single strongly connected component, which we call LSCC (L for\n``largest''), except for a single cycle of two transcription factors. Among\ndifferent physiological conditions, cell cycle has the most significant\nrelationship with LSCC, as the set of 64 transcription interactions that are\nactive in all phases of the cell cycle has overlap of 27 with the interactions\nof LSCC (of which there are 49). Conversely, if we remove the interactions that\nare active in all phases of the cell cycle (fewer than 1% of the total), the\nLSCC would have only three nodes and 5 edges, 4 of which are active only in the\nstress response subnetwork. LSCC has a special place in the topology of the\nnetwork and it can be used to define a natural hierarchy in the network; in\nevery physiological subnetwork LSCC plays a pivotal role. Apart from those\nwell-defined conditions, the transcription network of S. cerevisiae is devoid\nof cycles. It was observed that two conditions that were studied and that have\nno cycles of their own are exogenous: diauxic shift and DNA repair, while cell\ncycle, sporulation are endogenous.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2007 19:58:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-19"}

Morphologies are determined with an\nautomated method, using the Sersic parameter n and a measure of the residual\nfrom the model fits, called ``bumpiness'', to distinguish different\nmorphologies. These classifications are verified with visual classifications.\nIn agreement with previous studies, 65-70% of the galaxies are located on the\nred sequence, both at z~0.03 and at z~0.8. Similarly, 65-70% of the galaxies\nhave n>2.5. The fraction of E+S0 galaxies is 43+/-3%$ at z~0.03 and 48+/-7% at\nz~0.8, i.e., it has not changed significantly since z~0.8. When combined with\nrecent results for cluster galaxies in the same redshift range, we find that\nthe morphology-density relation for galaxies more massive than 0.5M* has\nremained constant since at least z~0.8. This implies that galaxies evolve in\nmass, morphology and density such that the morphology-density relation does not\nchange. In particular, the decline of star formation activity and the\naccompanying increase in the stellar mass density of red galaxies since z~1\nmust happen without large changes in the early-type galaxy fraction in a given\nenvironment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2007 19:11:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2007 21:27:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The method is based on the Marscher & Gear (1985) shock model, but\nwe have implemented the modifications to the model suggested by Bjornsson &\nAslaksen (2000), which make the flux density increase in the initial phase less\nabrupt.

It is shown that, even in a strongly nonlinear regime, the\nchain in thermal equilibrium can be effectively described by a system of weakly\ninteracting \\textit{renormalized} nonlinear waves. These waves possess (i) the\nRayleigh-Jeans distribution and (ii) zero correlations between waves, just as\nnoninteracting free waves would. This renormalization is achieved through a set\nof canonical transformations. The renormalized linear dispersion of these\nrenormalized waves is obtained and shown to be in excellent agreement with\nnumerical experiments. Moreover, a dynamical interpretation of the\nrenormalization of the dispersion relation is provided via a self-consistency,\nmean-field argument. It turns out that this renormalization arises mainly from\nthe trivial resonant wave interactions, i.e., interactions with no momentum\nexchange. Furthermore, using a multiple time-scale, statistical averaging\nmethod, we show that the interactions of near-resonant waves give rise to the\nbroadening of the resonance peaks in the frequency spectrum of renormalized\nmodes. The theoretical prediction for the resonance width for the thermalized\n$\\beta$-FPU chain is found to be in very good agreement with its numerically\nmeasured value.

The\ninfluence of dark energy on the growth of large-scale cosmological structures\nis exerted both through its background effect on the expansion rate, and\nthrough its perturbations as well. In order to compute the rate of formation of\nmassive objects we employ the Spherical Collapse formalism, which we generalize\nto include fluids with pressure.

We\nthen consider a wide range of constant and time-dependent equations of state\n(including phantom models) parametrized in a standard way, and study their\nimpact on the non-linear growth of structure. The main effect is the formation\nof dark energy structure associated with the dark matter halo: non-phantom\nequations of state induce the formation of a dark energy halo, damping the\ngrowth of structures; phantom models, on the other hand, generate dark energy\nvoids, enhancing structure growth. Finally, we employ the Press-Schechter\nformalism to compute how dark energy affects the number of massive objects as a\nfunction of redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2007 11:50:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2007 15:10:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2007 12:50:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The cost of each sensor includes a\nfixed component, and a variable component that is proportional to the\nfield-of-view area. When only one type of sensor or, in general, one type of\ndisc, is available, then a simple polynomial algorithm solves the problem. When\nthere are different types of sensors in terms of fixed and variable costs, the\nproblem becomes NP-hard. A branch-and-bound algorithm as well as an efficient\nheuristic are developed.

The sources,\nwell-known emitters at soft-medium X-rays, were detected at >5sigma with the\nBAT experiment in 15-150 keV. No flux variability was detected within the XRT\nand BAT exposures, with the exception of 0836+710 which shows an increase of a\nfactor 4 of the 15-150 keV flux on a timescale of one month. The 0.3-10 keV\nspectra are well fitted by power law models, with rather hard continua (photon\nindices Gamma_XRT ~1.3-1.5); similarly, the 15-150 keV spectra are described by\npower laws with Gamma_BAT ~1.3-1.8. The XRT data exhibit spectral curvature,\nwhich can be modeled either in terms of excess absorption along the line of\nsight, or a downward-curved broken power law. In the former case, if the excess\nN_H is at the rest-frame of the source, columns of N_H^z=(0.3-6)x10^22 cm^-2\nare measured.

ApJ accepted","journal-ref":null,"doi":"10.1086/521593","report-no":null,"categories":"astro-ph","license":null,"abstract":"  More than half of stars reside in binary or multiple star systems and many\nplanets have been found in binary systems. From theoretical point of view,\nhowever, whether or not the planetary formation proceeds in a binary system is\na very complex problem, because secular perturbation from the companion star\ncan easily stir up the eccentricity of the planetesimals and cause\nhigh-velocity, destructive collisions between planetesimals. Early stage of\nplanetary formation process in binary systems has been studied by restricted\nthree-body approach with gas drag and it is commonly accepted that accretion of\nplanetesimals can proceed due to orbital phasing by gas drag. However, the gas\ndrag becomes less effective as the planetesimals become massive. Therefore it\nis still uncertain whether the collision velocity remains small and planetary\naccretion can proceed, once the planetesimals become massive. We performed {\\it\nN}-body simulations of planetary formation in binary systems starting from\nmassive planetesimals whose size is about 100-500 km. We found that the\neccentricity vectors of planetesimals quickly converge to the forced\neccentricity due to the coupling of the perturbation of the companion and the\nmutual interaction of planetesimals if the initial disk model is sufficiently\nwide in radial distribution. This convergence decreases the collision velocity\nand as a result accretion can proceed much in the same way as in isolated\nsystems. The basic processes of the planetary formation, such as runaway growth\nand oligarchic growth and final configuration of the protoplanets are\nessentially the same in binary systems and single star systems, at least in the\nlate stage where the effect of gas drag is small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2007 15:50:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
