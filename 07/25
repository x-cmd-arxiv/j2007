Then the measured values\nof the flavor parameters do not lead to any fundamental symmetries, but are\nstatistical accidents; their precise values do not provide any insights into\nthe fundamental theory, rather the overall pattern of flavor reflects the\nunderlying landscape.

We use the\ntransmission capacity (TC) as our metric, defined as the maximum spatial\nintensity of successful simultaneous transmissions subject to a constraint on\nthe outage probability (OP). By assuming the nodes are located on the infinite\nplane according to a Poisson process, we are able to employ tools from\nstochastic geometry to obtain asymptotically tight bounds on the distribution\nof the signal-to-interference (SIR) level, yielding in turn tight bounds on the\nOP (relative to a given SIR threshold) and the TC.

In this\nwork we study the effect of magnetic surface flux distribution on the coronal\nfield topology and angular momentum loss rate. We investigate if magnetic flux\nconcentration towards the pole is a reasonable alternative to dynamo\nsaturation. We construct a 1D wind model and also apply a 2-D self-similar\nanalytical model, to evaluate how the surface field distribution affects the\nangular momentum loss of the rotating star. From the 1D model we find that, in\na magnetically dominated low corona, the concentrated polar surface field\nrapidly expands to regions of low magnetic pressure resulting in a coronal\nfield with small latitudinal variation. We also find that the angular momentum\nloss rate due to a uniform field or a concentrated field with equal total\nmagnetic flux is very similar. From the 2D wind model we show that there are\nseveral relevant factors to take into account when studying the angular\nmomentum loss from a star. In particular, we show that the inclusion of force\nbalance across the field in a wind model is fundamental if realistic\nconclusions are to be drawn from the effect of non-uniform surface field\ndistribution on magnetic braking. This model predicts that a magnetic field\nconcentrated at high latitudes leads to larger Alfven radii and larger braking\nrates than a smoother field distribution. From the results obtained, we argue\nthat the magnetic surface field distribution towards the pole does not directly\nlimit the braking efficiency of the wind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2007 16:08:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-25"}

We consider its generalisation,\ncalled the semi-local LCS problem, which arises naturally in many\nstring-related problems. The semi-local LCS problem asks for the LCS scores for\neach of the input strings against every substring of the other input string,\nand for every prefix of each input string against every suffix of the other\ninput string. Such a comparison pattern provides a much more detailed picture\nof string similarity than a single LCS score; it also arises naturally in many\nstring-related problems. In fact, the semi-local LCS problem turns out to be\nfundamental for string comparison, providing a powerful and flexible\nalternative to classical dynamic programming. It is especially useful when the\ninput to a string comparison problem may not be available all at once: for\nexample, comparison of dynamically changing strings; comparison of compressed\nstrings; parallel string comparison. The same approach can also be applied to\npermutation strings, providing efficient solutions for local versions of the\nlongest increasing subsequence (LIS) problem, and for the problem of computing\na maximum clique in a circle graph. Furthermore, the semi-local LCS problem\nturns out to have surprising connections in a few seemingly unrelated fields,\nsuch as computational geometry and algebra of semigroups. This work is devoted\nto exploring the structure of the semi-local LCS problem, its efficient\nsolutions, and its applications in string comparison and other related areas,\nincluding computational molecular biology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2007 19:12:23 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2009 16:07:43 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2009 22:16:33 GMT"},{"version":"v12","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2009 13:08:55 GMT"},{"version":"v13","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2009 14:48:06 GMT"},{"version":"v14","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2009 20:34:12 GMT"},{"version":"v15","created":"Sat, 9 Jan 2010 16:22:30 GMT"},{"version":"v16","created":"Tue, 11 May 2010 11:43:57 GMT"},{"version":"v17","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2012 22:50:39 GMT"},{"version":"v18","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2012 12:52:02 GMT"},{"version":"v19","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2013 02:37:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2007 13:29:39 GMT"},{"version":"v20","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2013 20:54:28 GMT"},{"version":"v21","created":"Sat, 23 Nov 2013 23:30:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2007 14:09:50 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 21 Aug 2008 15:17:48 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2008 22:31:37 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 10 Dec 2008 19:46:02 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Mon, 12 Jan 2009 17:49:28 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Sun, 22 Mar 2009 16:36:29 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2009 15:59:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

Throughout this period mass\naccretion rates through the disk can reach 10^{-6}-10^{-5} M_Sun/yr leading to\nsubstantial energy release in the vicinity of stellar surface. We study the\nimpact of irradiation of the stellar surface produced by the hot inner disk on\nproperties of accreting fully convective low-mass stars, and also look at\nobjects such as young brown dwarfs and giant planets. At high accretion rates\nirradiation raises the surface temperature of the equatorial region above the\nphotospheric temperature T_0 that a star would have in the absence of\naccretion. The high-latitude (polar) parts of the stellar surface, where disk\nirradiation is weak, preserve their temperature at the level of T_0. In\nstrongly irradiated regions an almost isothermal outer radiative zone forms on\ntop of the fully convective interior, leading to the suppression of the local\ninternal cooling flux derived from stellar contraction (similar suppression\noccurs in irradiated ``hot Jupiters''). Properties of this radiative zone\nlikely determine the amount of thermal energy that gets advected into the\nconvective interior of the star. Total intrinsic luminosity integrated over the\nwhole stellar surface is reduced compared to the non-accreting case, by up to a\nfactor of several in some systems (young brown dwarfs, stars in quasar disks,\nforming giants planets), potentially leading to the retardation of stellar\ncontraction. Stars and brown dwarfs irradiated by their disks tend to lose\nenergy predominantly through their cool polar regions while young giant planets\naccreting through the disk cool through their whole surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2007 20:23:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

This implies an empirical relation\nbetween the minimum amount of stars a galaxy will form and its initial baryonic\nmass. While the stellar mass of a galaxy seems to be only loosely connected to\nits baryonic mass, the latter quantity is strongly linked to the galaxy's\ndynamical mass as it is observed in the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation.

Such an alignment does not\ninvoke paramagnetic dissipation (i.e. Davis-Greenstein mechanism), but,\nnevertheless, grains tend to be aligned with long axes perpendicular to the\nmagnetic field.

As the alignment of grain axes with respect to angular momentum is\nhigher for higher values of $J$, counter-intuitively, gaseous bombardment can\nincrease the degree of grain alignment in respect to the magnetic field.

The response functions are shown to have a\nnatural interpretation in terms of the renormalizations of the Abelian and the\nnon-Abelian coupling constants. A detailed analysis of the screening of heavy\nquark potential and of the exact role played by the Debye mass screening in the\ncase of the Cornell potential, is performed. We also discuss the non-Abelian\ncontribution to Landau damping in QGP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2007 09:52:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2007 07:18:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2008 16:02:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-20"}

The timestepper approach to bifurcation\nanalysis of large scale systems is applied to the plane Poiseuille flow of an\nOldroyd-B fluid with non-monotonic slip at the wall, in order to further\ninvestigate a mechanism of extrusion instability based on the combination of\nviscoelasticity and nonmonotonic slip. Due to the nonmonotonicity of the slip\nequation the resulting steady-state flow curve is nonmonotonic and unstable\nsteady-states appear in the negative-slope regime. It has been known that\nself-sustained oscillations of the pressure gradient are obtained when an\nunstable steady-state is perturbed [Fyrillas et al., Polymer Eng.

It is shown\nfor the first time how equilibrium solutions lose stability to oscillating ones\nthrough a subcritical Hopf bifurcation point which generates a branch of\nunstable limit cycles and how the stable periodic solutions lose their\nstability through a critical point which marks the onset of the unstable limit\ncycles. This implicates the coexistence of stable equilibria with stable and\nunstable periodic solutions in a narrow range of volumetric flow rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2007 15:14:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-02"}
