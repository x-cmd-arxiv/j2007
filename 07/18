We also find that a significant fraction (20-30 per\ncent) of our starburst galaxies have morphologies indicative of either an\nongoing or recent tidal interaction and/or merger. These findings\nnotwithstanding, there remain a significant portion of starburst galaxies where\nlocal environmental influences are not in any obvious way playing a triggering\nrole, leading us to conclude that starbursts can also be internally driven.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2007 16:48:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Thus, individuals\nconfront a new dilemma: on the one hand, they may be inclined to choose the\nshared reward despite the possibility of being exploited by defectors; on the\nother hand, if too many players do that, cooperators will obtain a poor reward\nand defectors will outperform them. By appropriately tuning the amount to be\nshared a vast variety of scenarios arises, including traditional ones in the\nstudy of cooperation as well as more complex situations where unexpected\nbehavior can occur. We provide a complete classification of the equilibria of\nthe $n$-player game as well as of its evolutionary dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2007 19:00:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2007 09:13:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-02"}

The prime objective of this study is\nthe production of optimal resolution three-dimensional maps fully\nvolume-covering of the volume-weighted velocity and density fields throughout\nthe nearby Universe, out to a distance of 150 Mpc/h. Based on the Voronoi and\nDelaunay tessellation defined by the spatial galaxy sample, DTFE involves the\nestimate of density values on the basis of the volume of the related Delaunay\ntetrahedra and the subsequent use of theDelaunay tessellation as natural\nmultidimensional (linear) interpolation grid for the corresponding density and\nvelocity fields throughout the sample volume. The linearized model of the\nspatial galaxy distribution and the corresponding peculiar velocities of the\nPSCz galaxy sample, produced by Brachini et al. (1999), forms the input sample\nfor the DTFE study. The DTFE maps reproduce the high-density supercluster\nregions in optimal detail, both their internal structure as well as their\nelongated or flattened shape. The corresponding velocity flows trace the bulk\nand shear flows marking the region extending from the Pisces-Perseus\nsupercluster, via the Local superclusters, towards the Hydra-Centaurus and the\nShapley concentration. The most outstanding and unique feature of the DTFE maps\nis the sharply defined radial outflow regions in and around underdense voids,\nmarking the dynamical importance of voids in the Local Universe. The maximum\nexpansion rate of voids defines a sharp cutoff in the DTFE velocity divergence\npdf.

Algorithms based on slope\nlimiters, analogous to those used in second order schemes for hyperbolic\nequations, are proposed to fix these problems.

The evolution of the flow with time, which is\nmainly due to appearance of velocity packets called Evershed clouds (ECs), may\nprovide information to further constrain its origin. Here we undertake a\ndetailed analysis of the evolution of the Evershed flow by studying the\nproperties of ECs. In this first paper we determine the sizes, proper motions,\nlocation in the penumbra, and frequency of appearance of ECs, as well as their\ntypical Doppler velocities, linear and circular polarization signals, Stokes V\narea asymmetries, and continuum intensities. High-cadence, high-resolution,\nfull vector spectropolarimetric measurements in visible and infrared lines are\nused to derive these parameters. We find that ECs appear in the mid penumbra\nand propage outward along filaments with large linear polarization signals and\nenhanced Evershed flows. The frequency of appearance of ECs varies between 15\nand 40 minutes in different filaments. ECs exhibit the largest Doppler\nvelocities and linear-to-circular polarization ratios of the whole penumbra. In\naddition, lines formed deeper in the atmosphere show larger Doppler velocities,\nmuch in the same way as the ''quiescent'' Evershed flow. According to our\nobservations, ECs can be classified in two groups: type I ECs, which vanish in\nthe outer penumbra, and type II ECs, which cross the outer penumbral boundary\nand enter the sunspot moat. Most of the observed ECs belong to type I. On\naverage, type II ECs can be detected as velocity structures outside of the spot\nfor only about 14 min. Their proper motions in the moat are significantly\nreduced with respect to the ones they had in the penumbra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2007 03:46:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The predominantly molecular inner gas disk transitions smoothly into an\natomic outer gas disk, with equivalent atomic and molecular gas surface\ndensities at R = 3.5' (6 kpc). We estimate that the total H2 mass is 3 X 10^9\nMo, roughly 1/3 of the interstellar hydrogen gas mass, and about 2% of the\ndynamical mass of the galaxy at our assumed distance of 6 Mpc. The value of the\nCO(2-1)/CO(1-0) line ratio ranges from 0.35 to 2; 50% of the map is covered by\nvery high ratio, >1, gas.

In particular, there is an exact\ncorrespondence between the fifth-dimension coordinate z of AdS space and a\nspecific impact variable zeta which measures the separation of the quark\nconstituents within the hadron in ordinary space-time. This connection allows\none to compute the analytic form of the frame-independent light-front\nwavefunctions of mesons and baryons, the fundamental entities which encode\nhadron properties and allow the computation of exclusive scattering amplitudes.\nI also discuss a number of novel phenomenological features of QCD. Initial- and\nfinal-state interactions from gluon-exchange, normally neglected in the parton\nmodel, have a profound effect in QCD hard-scattering reactions, leading to\nleading-twist single-spin asymmetries, diffractive deep inelastic scattering,\ndiffractive hard hadronic reactions, the breakdown of the Lam Tung relation in\nDrell-Yan reactions, and nuclear shadowing and non-universal\nantishadowing--leading-twist physics not incorporated in the light-front\nwavefunctions of the target computed in isolation. I also discuss tests of\nhidden color in nuclear wavefunctions, the use of diffraction to materialize\nthe Fock states of a hadronic projectile and test QCD color transparency, and\nanomalous heavy quark effects. The presence of direct higher-twist processes\nwhere a proton is produced in the hard subprocess can explain the large\nproton-to-pion ratio seen in high-centrality heavy-ion collisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2007 06:21:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Jul 2007 07:50:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2007 07:40:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-11"}

The studies dealing with this phenomenon are seldom and most of the\nscientific work has been focused on flow electrification of aqueous and\ninsulating Newtonian liquids. From that prior art it is well established that\nthe flow electrification in Newtonian liquids is a consequence of the formation\nof an ionic double layer. Convection of this layer induces the electrification\nof the liquid at the outlet of the pipe. In those models, the key parameters\ngoverning the flow electrification are thus the intrinsic electrical properties\nof the polymer and the flow characteristics. In this work, we reconsider the\nassumptions made previously and we propose a new approach to modelise the flow\nelectrification in the particular case of non-Newtonian polymer materials in\nlaminar flow conditions. We establish that, a key parameter for the\nelectrification quantification in the polymer melt is the shape of the velocity\nprofile. Additionally, in some cases, we show that a slip velocity at the\npolymer/die wall interface must be considered to describe accurately the\nelectrification. As a consequence, we deduce that the slip velocity at the\ninterface can be calculated by measuring the electrification: this work gives\nan alternative manner to measure the slip velocity during polymer flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2007 06:44:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-19"}

In our study, the capillary extrusion of a metallocene\npolyethylene (mPE) through a tungsten carbide die is characterized through\naccurate electrical measurements thanks a Faraday pail. No significant charges\nare observed since the extrudate surface remains smooth. However, as soon as\nthe sharkskin distortion appears, measurable charges are collected (around 5\n10-8 C/m2). Higher level of charges are measured during the spurt or the\ngross-melt fracture (g.m.f) defects. This work is focused on the electrical\ncharging during the sharkskin instability. The variation of the electrical\ncharges versus the apparent wall shear stress is investigated for different die\ngeometries. This curve exhibits a linear increase, followed by a sudden growth\njust before the onset of the spurt instability. This abrupt charging\ncorresponds also to the end of the sharkskin instability. It is also well-known\nthat wall slip appears just at the same time, with smaller velocity values than\nduring spurt flow.

Scattering tends to dominate, leaving behind abundant material\nthat can accrete into terrestrial planets. Aims: We add to the possible realism\nof our model by simulating type I migration forces which cause an inward drift,\nand strong eccentricity and inclination damping of protoplanetary bodies. This\nextra dissipation might be expected to enhance shepherding at the expense of\nscattering, possibly modifying our previous conclusions. Methods: We employ an\nN-body code that is linked to a viscous gas disk algorithm capable of\nsimulating: gas accretion onto the central star; gap formation in the vicinity\nof the giant planet; type II migration of the giant planet; type I migration of\nprotoplanets; and the effect of gas drag on planetesimals. We use the code to\nre-run three scenarios from a previous work where type I migration was not\nincluded. Results: The additional dissipation introduced by type I migration\nenhances the inward shepherding of material but does not severely reduce\nscattering. We find that > 50% of the solids disk material still survives the\nmigration in scattered exterior orbits: most of it well placed to complete\nterrestrial planet formation at < 3 AU.

Simulations\nwere performed using a grid--based hydrodynamics code. First we present a set\nof calculations that study how a binary interacts with a circumbinary disk. We\nevolve the system for 10^5 binary orbits, which is the time needed for the\nsystem to reach a quasi-equilibrium state. From this time onward the apsidal\nlines of the disk and the binary are aligned, and the binary eccentricity\nremains essentially unchanged with a value of e_b ~ 0.08.

Core\naccretion models reproduce this trend, since the protoplanetary disk of a high\nmetallicity star has a high density of solids and so forms cores which accrete\ngas before the primordial gas disk dissipates. This paper considers the origin\nof the form of Ppl(Z). We introduce a simple model in which detectable planets\nform when the mass of solids in the protoplanetary disk, Ms, exceeds a critical\nvalue. In this model the form of Ppl(Z) is a direct reflection of the\ndistribution of protoplanetary disk masses, Mg, and the observed Ppl(Z) is\nreproduced if P(Mg>Mg') oc 1/Mg'^2. We argue that a protoplanetary disk's\nsub-mm dust mass is a pristine indicator of the mass available for\nplanet-building and find the observed sub-mm disk mass distribution is\nconsistent with the observed Ppl(Z) if Ms>0.5M_J is required to form detectable\nplanets. Any planet formation model which imposes a critical solid mass for\nplanet formation would reproduce the observed Ppl(Z), and core accretion models\nare empirically consistent with a threshold criterion. We identify 7\nprotoplanetary disks which, by rigid application of this criterion, would be\nexpected to form detectable planets. A testable prediction is that Ppl(Z)\nshould flatten both for Z>0.5dex and as more distant and lower mass planets are\ndiscovered. Further, combining this model with one in which the evolution of a\nstar's debris disk is also influenced by the solid mass in its protoplanetary\ndisk, results in the prediction that debris disks detected around stars with\nplanets should be more infrared luminous than those around stars without\nplanets in tentative agreement with recent observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2007 14:51:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-19"}
