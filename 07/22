We treat the case where without the gravitational\ninduced phase shift the very strong coherent state goes out of one output port\nwhile the squeezed vacuum goes out the other output port (the ``dark'' port).\nWhile the phase shift produced by the gravitation waves does not give any\nsignificant change in the strong coherent output, the light intensity in the\n``dark'' port is amplified with decreased fluctuations as the squeezing\nincreases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jul 2007 14:56:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-24"}

The\nhalo model decomposition makes the remarkable prediction that the mean\nluminosity of the non-central galaxies in a halo should be almost independent\nof halo mass: the predicted increase is about 20% while the halo mass increases\nby a factor of more than 20. In contrast, the luminosity of the central object\nis predicted to increase approximately linearly with halo mass at low to\nintermediate masses, and logarithmically at high masses. We show that this\nweak, almost non-existent mass-dependence of the satellites is in excellent\nagreement with the satellite population in group catalogs constructed by two\ndifferent collaborations. This is remarkable, because the halo model prediction\nwas made without ever identifying groups and clusters. The halo model also\npredicts that the number of satellites in a halo is drawn from a Poisson\ndistribution with mean which depends on halo mass. This, combined with the weak\ndependence of satellite luminosity on halo mass, suggests that the Scott\neffect, such that the luminosities of very bright galaxies are merely the\nstatistically extreme values of a general luminosity distribution, may better\napply to the most luminous satellite galaxy in a halo than to BCGs. If galaxies\nare identified with halo substructure at the present time, then central\ngalaxies should be about 4 times more massive than satellite galaxies of the\nsame luminosity, whereas the differences between the stellar M/L ratios should\nbe smaller. Therefore, a comparison of the weak lensing signal from central and\nsatellite galaxies should provide useful constraints.
