As a plausible means of efficiently separating a small population of\nnonthermal particles from the bulk accretion flows, we investigate the\nformation of standing dissipative shocks, i.e. shocks at which fraction of the\nenergy, angular momentum and mass fluxes do not participate in the shock\ntransition of the flow that accretes onto the compact object but are lost into\ncollimated (jets) or uncollimated (winds) outflows. The mass loss fraction (at\na shock front) is found to vary over a wide range (0 - 95%) depending on flow's\nangular momentum and energy. On the other hand, the associated energy loss\nfraction appears to be relatively low (<1%) for a flow onto a non-rotating\nblack hole case, whereas the fraction could be an order of magnitude higher\n(<10%) for a flow onto a rapidly-rotating black hole. By estimating the escape\nvelocity of the outflowing particles with a mass-accretion rate relevant for\ntypical active galactic nuclei, we find that nearly 10% of the accreting mass\ncould escape to form an outflow in a disk around a non-rotating black hole,\nwhile as much as 50% of the matter may contribute to outflows in a disk around\na rapidly-rotating black hole. In the context of disk-jet paradigm, our model\nsuggests that shock-driven outflows from accretion can occur in regions not too\nfar from a central engine.

In addition to cosmological cosmic ray\ninteractions in the IGM, we include additional processes driven by SN\nexplosions: neutrino spallation and a low energy component in the structures\nejected by outflows to the IGM. We take into account CNO CRs impinging on the\nintergalactic gas.

The ground state of $^8$He has both the $j$-$j$ coupling\nfeature($p_{3/2}$ closure) and the $L$-$S$ coupling feature($^4$He$+2n+2n$)\nwith a slight tail of dineutron at the long distance region. The theoretical\nresults give an indication of the $0^+_2$ state with dineutron gas-like\nstructure. The dineutron structure, $^4$He+$2n$+$2n$, of this state is similar\nto the $3\\alpha$-cluster structure of the $^{12}$C($0^+_2$) state which has\nbeen interpreted as an $\\alpha$ condensate state. Since the $^8$He($0^+_2$)\nstate has a significant overlap with the dineutron condensate wave function\nwhere two dineutrons are moving in $S$ wave around the $\\alpha$ core with a\ndilute density, we suggest that this theoretically predicted $0^+_2$ state is a\ncandidate of the dineutron condensate state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Jul 2007 04:12:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The focus lies on dispersion relations in quantized\ninteracting models in the Yang-Feldman formalism. In particular, we compute the\ntwo-point correlation function of the field strength in noncommutative quantum\nelectrodynamics to second order. At this, we take into account the covariant\ncoordinates that allow the construction of local gauge invariant quantities\n(observables). It turns out that this does not remove the well-known severe\ninfrared problem, as one might have hoped. Instead, things become worse, since\nnonlocal divergences appear. We also show that these cancel in a supersymmetric\nversion of the theory if the covariant coordinates are adjusted accordingly.\n  Furthermore, we study the phi^3 and the Wess-Zumino model and show that the\ndistortion of the dispersion relations is moderate for parameters typical for\nthe Higgs field. We also disuss the formulation of gauge theories on\nnoncommutative spaces and study classical electrodynamics on the noncommutative\nMinkowski space using covariant coordinates. In particular, we compute the\nchange of the speed of light due to nonlinear effects in the presence of a\nbackground field. Finally, we examine the so-called twist approach to quantum\nfield theory on the noncommutative Minkowski space and point out some\nconceptual problems of this approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Jul 2007 11:16:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-17"}

In\nEinstein's theory, restricting attention to scalar variables, this evolution\ncan be modeled by solutions of a set of Friedmann equations for an effective\nvolume scale factor, with matter and backreaction source terms. The latter can\nbe represented by an effective scalar field (`morphon field') modeling Dark\nEnergy.\n  The present work provides an overview over the Dark Energy debate in\nconnection with the impact of inhomogeneities, and formulates strategies for a\ncomprehensive quantitative evaluation of backreaction effects both in\ntheoretical and observational cosmology. We recall the basic steps of a\ndescription of backreaction effects in relativistic cosmology that lead to\nrefurnishing the standard cosmological equations, but also lay down a number of\nchallenges and unresolved issues in connection with their observational\ninterpretation.\n  The present status of this subject is intermediate: we have a good\nqualitative understanding of backreaction effects pointing to a global\ninstability of the standard model of cosmology; exact solutions and\nperturbative results modeling this instability lie in the right sector to\nexplain Dark Energy from inhomogeneities. It is fair to say that, even if\nbackreaction effects turn out to be less important than anticipated by some\nresearchers, the concordance high-precision cosmology, the architecture of\ncurrent N-body simulations, as well as standard perturbative approaches may all\nfall short in correctly describing the Late Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Jul 2007 14:23:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2007 10:56:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2007 15:16:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}
