We also review the current ideas on the pumping mechanism for H2CO\n6cm masers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2007 17:32:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Optical spectra show they have lower\nDn(4000) and HdeltaA indices, higher Hbeta emission-line equivalents widths,\nand higher [OIII]5007/Hbeta emission-line ratios than normal star forming\ngalaxies.

The\nproposal relies on the existence of topological states of matter whose\nquasiparticle excitations are neither bosons nor fermions, but are particles\nknown as {\\it Non-Abelian anyons}, meaning that they obey {\\it non-Abelian\nbraiding statistics}. Quantum information is stored in states with multiple\nquasiparticles, which have a topological degeneracy. The unitary gate\noperations which are necessary for quantum computation are carried out by\nbraiding quasiparticles, and then measuring the multi-quasiparticle states. The\nfault-tolerance of a topological quantum computer arises from the non-local\nencoding of the states of the quasiparticles, which makes them immune to errors\ncaused by local perturbations.

We argue here that this assumption agrees with the absence of the GZK\ncutoff (at least according to AGASA data) in the energy spectrum of the cosmic\nray due to the cosmic interaction with the CMB at $6\\times 10^{19} eV$ or\nabove. Within 50 Mpc from Earth, the matter and light distributions are close\nto an anisotropic distribution, where the local cluster and local\nsuper-clusters of galaxies can be identified. In contrast, the ultra high\nenergy comic rays data is consistent to an almost isotropic distribution, and\nthere is no correlation between their arrival direction and astronomical\nsources within our local cluster. This means that the events above the GZK\ncutoff come from distances above 50 Mpc, without an apparent energy loss. This\nscenario is plausible under the assumption of the CMB concentrated only within\n3-4 Mpc from Earth. In other words, the CMB has a local origin linked only to\nthe local super-cluster of galaxies.

We also provide some insight into the notion of generalized Nash\nequilibrium by proving that it is closely related to the notion of\nrationalizability when we restrict the analysis to games in normal form and no\nunawareness is involved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2007 23:21:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-17"}

One long, narrow\nfeature points toward Sgr A*, and so we propose that this feature is a jet of\nsynchrotron-emitting particles ejected from the supermassive black hole.

The models are\nasymptotically free and are invariant under a chiral symmetry. These\nsimilarities to QCD make them perfect benchmark systems for fermion actions\nused in large scale lattice QCD computations. The Schroedinger functional for\nthe Gross-Neveu models is defined for both, Wilson and Ginsparg-Wilson\nfermions, and shown to be renormalisable in 1-loop lattice perturbation theory.\nIn two dimensions four fermion interactions of the Gross-Neveu models have\ndimensionless coupling constants. The symmetry properties of the four fermion\ninteraction terms and the relations among them are discussed. For Wilson\nfermions chiral symmetry is explicitly broken and additional terms must be\nincluded in the action. Chiral symmetry is restored up to cut-off effects by\ntuning the bare mass and one of the couplings. The critical mass and the\nsymmetry restoring coupling are computed to second order in lattice\nperturbation theory. This result is used in the 1-loop computation of the\nrenormalised couplings and the associated beta-functions. The renormalised\ncouplings are defined in terms of suitable boundary-to-boundary correlation\nfunctions. In the computation the known first order coefficients of the\nbeta-functions are reproduced.

The first model is an Ising chain with antiferromagnetic exchange\ninteraction limited to nearest neighbors and subject to an oscillating magnetic\nfield. The system of master equations describing the time evolution of\nsublattice magnetizations can easily be solved within a linear field\napproximation and a long time limit. Resonant behavior of the magnetization as\na function of temperature (stochastic resonance) is found, at low frequency,\nonly when spins on opposite sublattices are uncompensated owing to different\ngyromagnetic factors (i.e., in the presence of a ferrimagnetic short range\norder). The second model is the axial next-nearest neighbor Ising (ANNNI)\nchain, where an antiferromagnetic exchange between next-nearest neighbors (nnn)\nis assumed to compete with a nearest-neighbor (nn) exchange interaction of\neither sign. The long time response of the model to a weak, oscillating\nmagnetic field is investigated in the framework of a decoupling approximation\nfor three-spin correlation functions, which is required to close the system of\nmaster equations. The calculation, within such an approximate theoretical\nscheme, of the dynamic critical exponent z, defined as ${1/\\tau} \\approx ({1/\n{\\xi}})^z$ (where \\tau is the longest relaxation time and \\xi is the\ncorrelation length of the chain), suggests that the T=0 single spin-flip\nGlauber dynamics of the ANNNI chain is in a different universality class than\nthat of the unfrustrated Ising chain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2007 09:48:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

One of the main states is significantly\nharder than the others, peaking at ~ 20 keV, with only a weak low-energy\ncomponent. Due to the enigmatic nature of this object, hidden inside the strong\nstellar wind of its Wolf-Rayet companion, it has remained unclear whether this\nstate represents an intrinsic hard state, with truncation of the inner disc, or\nwhether it is just a result of increased local absorption. We study the X-ray\nlight curves from RXTE/ASM and CGRO/BATSE in terms of distributions and\ncorrelations of flux and hardness and find several signs of a bimodal behaviour\nof the accretion flow that are not likely to be the result of increased\nabsorption in a surrounding medium. Using INTEGRAL observations, we model the\nbroad-band spectrum of Cyg X-3 in its apparent hard state. We find that it can\nbe well described by a model of a hard state with a truncated disc, despite the\nlow cut-off energy, if the accreted power is supplied to the electrons in the\ninner flow in the form of acceleration rather than thermal heating, resulting\nin a hybrid electron distribution and a spectrum with a significant\ncontribution from non-thermal Comptonization, usually observed only in soft\nstates. The high luminosity of this non-thermal hard state implies that either\nthe transition takes place at significantly higher L/Ledd than in the usual\nadvection models, or the mass of the compact object is > 20 Msun, possibly\nmaking it the most massive black hole observed in an X-ray binary in our Galaxy\nso far.

Diffused and strongly temperature dependent peak in the complex\npermittivity is caused by a dielectric relaxation due to the dynamics of polar\nclusters. The relaxation appears below Burns temperature T_d in the THz range,\nslows down on cooling through the microwave and MHz range and anomalously\nbroadens. The shortest and longest relaxation times of the distribution of\nrelaxation times follow Arrhenius and Vogel-Fulcher law, respectively. The\ndegree of B-site order has only a small influence on the parameters of the\ndielectric relaxation and almost no influence on the phonon parameters. Below\nT_m ~ 180K, the distribution of relaxation frequencies becomes broader than our\nexperimental spectral range and frequency independent dielectric losses develop\nbelow 100 GHz in the spectra. Although the macroscopic crystal structure is\ncubic, IR spectra give evidence about the lower local symmetry which can be\nassigned to the presence of polar clusters below T_d. Infrared spectra above\nT_d still reveal more modes than predicted by selection rules in the\nparaelectric phase of the Fm-3m space group so that we suggest selection rules\nwhich take into account chemical inhomogeneity in the beta''-perovskite\nsublattice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2007 15:34:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
