In particular, excess momenta in the outflows of pAGB\nobjects suggest that a binary may be required to supply an additional source of\nenergy and angular momentum. The extraction of rotational energy from the\nengine is likely fundamental and may be facilitated if a dynamo is operating in\nthe interior. In this regard, single star magnetic outflow models have been\nproposed as mechanisms for producing and shaping PNe, however these models\nneglect the back-reaction of the large-scale magnetic field on the flow.\n  Here we present a transient $\\alpha-\\Omega$ dynamo operating in the envelope\nof an AGB star in (1) an isolated setting and (2) a common envelope in which\nthe secondary is a low-mass companion in-spiraling in the AGB interior. The\nback reaction of the fields on the shear is included and differential rotation\nand rotation deplete via turbulent dissipation and Poynting flux. For an\nisolated star, the shear must be resupplied in order to sufficiently sustain\nthe dynamo. We comment on the energy requirements that convection must satisfy\nto accomplish this. For the common envelope case, a robust dynamo can result as\nthe companion provides an additional source of energy and angular momentum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2007 17:53:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2007 15:49:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-10"}

Here, we test cold dark matter cosmology using isolated low mass\ndwarf galaxies from the SDSS with measured 21cm widths.

The enhanced phase mixing of 0.1 Hz harmonic Alfven waves\npropagating in strongly divergent, H_b=5 Mm, stratified coronal structures,\nH_rho=50 Mm, can fulfill 100% of an active region heating requirement, by\ngenerating viscous heating fluxes of F_H~2100 J /m^2 /s.

By \"non-trivial background\" we mean either a non-vacuum state in\nMinkowski spacetime or an arbitrary state in a curved spacetime. Starting with\nthe case of a flat spacetime, the basic properties of the particle and\nquasiparticle propagation are analyzed using two different methods other than\nthe conventional mean-field-based techniques: on the one hand, the quantum\nstate corresponding to the quasiparticle excitation is explicitly constructed;\non the other hand, the spectral representation of the two-point propagators is\nanalyzed. Both methods lead to the same results: the energy and decay rate of\nthe quasiparticles are determined by the real and imaginary parts of the\nretarded self-energy respectively. These general results are applied to two\nparticular quantum systems: first, a scalar particle immersed in a thermal\ngraviton bath; second, a simplified atomic model, seizing the opportunity to\nconnect with other statistical and first-quantized approaches. In the second\npart of the thesis the results are extended to curved spacetime. Working with a\nquasilocal quasiparticle concept the flat-spacetime results are recovered. In\ncosmology, within the adiabatic approximation, it is possible to go beyond the\nflat spacetime results and find additional effects due to the universe\nexpansion. The cosmologically-induced effects are analyzed, obtaining that\nthere might be an additional contribution to the particle decay due to the\nuniverse expansion. In the de Sitter case, this additional contribution\ncoincides with the decay rate in a thermal bath in a flat spacetime at the\ncorresponding de Sitter temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2007 11:07:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2007 14:07:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
