Accurate\nestimates of merging timescales are required for predictions of astrophysical\nquantities such as black hole binary merger rates, the build-up of stellar mass\nin central galaxies, and the statistical properties of satellite galaxies\nwithin dark matter halos. In this paper, we study the merging timescales of\nextended dark matter halos using N-body simulations. We compare these results\nto standard estimates based on the Chandrasekhar theory of dynamical friction.\nWe find that these standard predictions for merging timescales, which are often\nused in semi-analytic galaxy formation models, are systematically shorter than\nthose found in simulations. The discrepancy is approximately a factor of 1.7\nfor $M_sat/M_host \\approx 0.1$ and becomes larger for more disparate\nsatellite-to-host mass ratios, reaching a factor of $\\sim 3.3$ for\n$M_sat/M_host\\approx 0.01$. Based on our simulations, we propose a new, easily\nimplementable fitting formula that accurately predicts the timescale for an\nextended satellite to sink from the virial radius of a host halo down to the\nhalo's center for a wide range of $M_sat/M_host$ and orbits. Including a\ncentral bulge in each galaxy changes the merging timescale by $\\la 10%$. To\nhighlight one concrete application of our results, we show that merging\ntimescales often used in the literature overestimate the growth of stellar mass\nby satellite accretion by $\\approx 40 %$, with the extra mass gained in low\nmass ratio mergers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2007 18:39:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2007 16:09:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-08"}

Two of its characteristics, namely its length and differential length,\nare analyzed for Gaussian random fields. Its differential length per unit\nnormalized density contrast scales like the PDF of the underlying density\ncontrast times the total length times a quadratic Edgeworth correction\ninvolving the square of the spectral parameter.

The g-I\ncolor distribution of the clusters is bimodal with peaks at 0.85 and 1.35. The\nredder peak at g-I=1.35 is consistent with the predicted color for an old\nmetal-poor population. The clusters associated with the peak at g-I=0.85 are\ncentrally concentrated and interpreted as a younger and more metal-rich\npopulation. We suggest that these clusters have an age of ~ 0.4 Gyr and solar\nmetallicity based on a comparison with population synthesis models. The\nluminosity function of these \"blue\" clusters is well represented by a power\nlaw. Interestingly, the brightest shell associated with the galaxy harbors some\nof the youngest clusters observed.

We consider\nfour model quasars formed in 10^12-10^13 M_sun halos from different merging\nhistories. Our main results follow. Owing to massive starbursts and funneling\nof dense gas into the nuclear regions of merging galaxies, the CO is highly\nexcited and the flux density peaks between J=5-8. The CO morphology of z~6\nquasars often exhibits multiple emission peaks which arise from H2\nconcentrations which have not yet fully coalesced. Quasars at z~6 display a\nlarge range of sightline dependent line widths such that the lines are\nnarrowest when the rotating H2 gas associated with the quasar is viewed face-on\n(when L_B is largest), and broadest when the gas is seen edge-on (when L_B is\nlowest). Thus for all models selection effects exist such that quasars selected\nfor optical luminosity are preferentially face-on which may result in detected\nCO line widths narrower than the median. The sightline averaged line width is\nreflective of the circular velocity (V_c) of the host halo, and ranges from\nsigma~300-650 km/s. For optically selected QSOs, 10-25% (halo-mass dependant)\nof sightlines have narrow line widths compatible with the sole CO detection at\nz>6, J1148+5251. When accounting for both the temporal evolution of CO line\nwidths, as well as the redshift evolution of halo V_c, these models\nself-consistently account for the CO line widths of both z~2 sub-mm galaxies\nand QSO's. Finally, the dynamical mass derived from the sightline averaged line\nwidths provides a good estimate of the total mass, and allows for a stellar\nbulge and SMBH consistent with the local M_BH-M_bulge relation.

For (i), we have detected a region where both the charge and\non-site pairing correlations decay with power-laws in real space, which\nsuggests a metallic behavior. While pairing correlations are not dominant in\n(i), we have found that they become dominant as the system is doped in (ii), or\nas the electronic band structure is modified (with a broken electron-hole\nsymmetry) in (iii) in certain parameter regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jul 2007 09:22:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Sep 2007 20:26:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-16"}
