For mild corners,\nthere are two possible steady state solutions, one with a strong and one with a\nweak shock emanating from the corner. The weak shock is observed in supersonic\nflights. A long-standing natural conjecture is that the strong shock is\nunstable in some sense.\n  We resolve this issue by showing that a sharp wedge will eventually produce\nweak shocks at the tip when accelerated to a supersonic speed. More precisely\nwe prove that for upstream state as initial data in the entire domain, the\ntime-dependent solution is self-similar, with a weak shock at the tip of the\nwedge. We construct analytic solutions for self-similar potential flow, both\nisothermal and isentropic with arbitrary $\\gamma\\geq 1$.\n  In the process of constructing the self-similar solution, we develop a large\nnumber of theoretical tools for these elliptic regions. These tools allow us to\nestablish large-data results rather than a small perturbation. We show that the\nwave pattern persists as long as the weak shock is supersonic-supersonic; when\nthis is no longer true, numerics show a physical change of behaviour. In\naddition we obtain rather detailed information about the elliptic region,\nincluding analyticity as well as bounds for velocity components and shock\ntangents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Jul 2007 21:49:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2007 11:54:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2007 21:29:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2007 22:33:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

The observed radial\nvelocities of the ionized gas along the photometric major axis of M33 remain\nflat at ~22 km s^{-1} all the way into the center, while the stellar velocities\nshow a gradual rise from zero to 22 km s^{-1} over that same region.

The main idea lies in similarity of behavior of point charge electric\nfield and the strain field induced by point inclusion in the matrix. This opens\na way to simplify the structure of the expression for the strain tensor. In the\nsolution, the strain distribution consists of contributions related to faces\nand edges of the inclusion.

We particularly discuss the\nobserved possible GCS's rotational kinematics (V/sigma > 2) that appears to be\nsignificantly different from the stellar halo's one with a large velocity\ndispersion (~50 km/s). We consider that both halo field stars and old GCs can\noriginate from low-mass subhalos virialized at high redshifts (z >6). We\ninvestigate the final dynamical properties of the two old components in the\nLMC's halo formed from merging of low-mass subhalos with field stars and GCs.\nWe find that the GCS composed of old globular clusters (GCs) formed at high\nredshifts (z > 6) has little rotation (V/sigma ~0.4) and structure and\nkinematics similar to those of the stellar halo. This inconsistency between the\nsimulated GCS's kinematics and the observed one is found to be seen in models\nwith different parameters. This inconsistency therefore implies that if old,\nmetal-poor GCs in the LMC have rotational kinematics, they are highly unlikely\nto originate from the low-mass subhalos that formed the stellar halo. We thus\ndiscuss a scenario in which the stellar halo was formed from low-mass subhalos\nwith no/few GCs whereas the GCS was formed at the very early epoch of the LMC's\ndisk formation via dissipative minor and major merging of gas-rich subhalos and\ngas infall.

The cluster mass function is consistent with the IMF of other rich\nyoung open clusters in the higher mass range but shows a clear deficit of low\nmass stars and brown dwarfs with no objects below 0.1Msun. The aim of this\npaper is to test whether this peculiar mass function could result from\ndynamical evolution despite the young age of the cluster. We performed N-body\nnumerical calculations starting with a log-normal IMF and different initial\nconditions in terms of number of systems and cluster radius using the code\nNBODY3. We simulated the cluster dynamical evolution over 10 Myr and compared\nthe results to the observations. We found that it is possible to reproduce eta\nCha when starting with a very compact configuration (with Ninit=40 and\nR0=0.005pc) which suggests that the IMF of the association might not be\nabnormal. The high initial density might also explain the deficit of wide\nbinaries that is observed in the cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jul 2007 10:35:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Increasing of the\nDC field from Hc2 revealed the enlarging of losses with a maximum in the feld\nbetween Hc2 and Hc3. Losses at the maximum were considerably larger than in the\nmixed and in the normal states. The value of the DC field, where loss peak was\nobserved, depends on the amplitude and frequency of the ac feld. Close to Tc\nthis peak shifts below Hc2 which showed the coexistence of surface\nsuperconducting states and Abrikosov vortices. We observed a logarithmic\nfrequency dependence of the in-phase component of the susceptibility. Such\nfrequency dispersion of the inphase component resembles the response of\nspin-glass systems, but the out-of-phase component also exhibited frequency\ndispersion that is not a known feature of the classic spin-glass response.\nAnalysis of the experimental data with Kramers-Kronig relations showed the\npossible existence of the loss peak at very low frequencies (< 5 Hz). We found\nthat the amplitude of the third harmonic was not a cubic function of the ac\namplitude even at considerably weak ac felds. This does not leave any room for\ntreating the nonlinear effects on the basis of perturbation theory. We show\nthat the conception of surface vortices or surface critical currents could not\nadequately describe the existing experimental data.
