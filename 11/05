These clouds are mostly very compact and isolated, while some of\nthem are associated with large features such as Wright's Cloud or the northern\nextension of the Magellanic Stream. The remaining 439 candidate detections are\nidentified as extragalactic objects and have all been matched with optical\ncounterparts. Five of the six galaxies detected with M(HI)<10^7.5 solar masses\nare satellites of either the NGC672/IC1727 nearby galaxy pair or their\nneighboring dwarf irregular galaxy NGC784.

This allows us to\nsuccessfully extend the most popular and powerful normalized gradient flow or\nimaginary time method for computing the ground state of single component BEC to\ncompute the ground state of spin-1 BEC. An efficient and accurate\ndiscretization scheme, the backward-forward Euler sine-pseudospectral method\n(BFSP), is proposed to discretize the normalized gradient flow.

As one of the surface plasmon modes becomes\npropagative for some choice of parameters we adopt an adiabatic mode definition\nwhere we follow this mode into the propagative sector and count it together\nwith the surface plasmon contribution, calling this contribution \"plasmonic\".\nThe remaining modes are propagative cavity modes, which we call \"photonic\".

They are still quite H-rich, but show both N enhancement and C depletion.\nThey are thus identified as core H-burning objects showing products of the CNO\nequilibrium at their surface. Their progenitors are most likely supergiants of\nspectral types earlier than O4-6 and initial masses > 60 Msun. Their winds\nfollow a well defined modified wind momentum - luminosity relation (WLR): this\nis a strong indication that they are radiatively driven. Stellar abundances\ntend to favor a slightly super solar metallicity, at least for the lightest\nmetals. We note however that the evolutionary models seem to under-predict the\ndegree of N enrichment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2007 15:08:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
