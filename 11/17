The shrinkage technique optimally combines an\nempirical estimate of the covariance with a model (the target) to minimize the\ntotal mean squared error compared to the true underlying covariance. We test\nthis technique on N-body simulations and evaluate its performance by estimating\ncosmological parameters. Using a simple diagonal target, we show that the\nshrinkage estimator significantly outperforms both the empirical covariance and\nthe target individually when using a small number of simulations. We find that\nreducing noise in the covariance estimate is essential for properly estimating\nthe values of cosmological parameters as well as their confidence intervals. We\nextend our method to the jackknife covariance estimator and again find\nsignificant improvement, though simulations give better results. Even for\nthousands of simulations we still find evidence that our method improves\nestimation of the covariance matrix. Because our method is simple, requires\nnegligible additional numerical effort, and produces superior results, we\nalways advocate shrinkage estimation for the covariance of the power spectrum\nand other large-scale structure measurements when purely theoretical modeling\nof the covariance is insufficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Nov 2007 20:57:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Jul 2008 04:21:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Our idea is based\non the exchange between different force replicas to accelerate the equilibrium\nprocess. We have shown that the refolding pathways of single ubiquitin depend\non which terminus is fixed. If the N-end is fixed then the folding pathways are\ndifferent compared to the case when both termini are free, but fixing the\nC-terminal does not change them. Surprisingly, we have found that the anchoring\nterminal does not affect the pathways of individual secondary structures of\nthree-domain ubiquitin, indicating the important role of the multi-domain\nconstruction. Therefore, force-clamp experiments, in which one end of a protein\nis kept fixed, can probe the refolding pathways of a single free-end ubiquitin\nif one uses either the poly-ubiquitin or a single domain with the C-terminus\nanchored. However, it is shown that anchoring one end does not affect refolding\npathways of the titin domain I27, and the force-clamp spectroscopy is always\ncapable to predict folding sequencing of this protein. We have obtained the\nreasonable estimate for unfolding barrier of ubiqutin. The linkage between\nresidue Lys48 and the C-terminal of ubiquitin is found to have the dramatic\neffect on the location of the transition state along the end-to-end distance\nreaction coordinate, but the multi-domain construction leaves the transition\nstate almost unchanged. We have found that the maximum force in the\nforce-extension profile from constant velocity force pulling simulations\ndepends on temperature nonlinearly.

The\nDevil's Staircase associated with the Circle Map is a function that transforms\nhorizontal unit interval I onto vertical I, and is endowed with the\nFarey-Brocot (F-B) structure in the vertical axis via the rational heights of\nstability intervals. The underlying Cantor-dust fractal set Omega in the\nhorizontal axis --Omega contained in I, with fractal dimension d(Omega) approx.\n0.87-- has a natural covering with segments that also follow the F-B hierarchy:\ntherefore, the staircase associates vertical I (of unit dimension) with\nhorizontal Omega in I (of dimension approx. 0.87), i.e. it selects a certain\nsubset Omega of I, both sets F- B structured, the selected Omega with smaller\ndimension than that of I. Hence, the structure of the staircase mirrors the F-\nB hierarchy. In this paper we consider the subset Omega-F-B of I that\nconcentrates the measure induced by the F-B partition and calculate its\nHausdorff dimension, i.e. the entropic or information dimension of the F-B\nmeasure, and show that it coincides with d(Omega) approx. 0.87.

Finally, we calculate the statistical \"Euclidean\"\ndimension (based on the ordinary Lebesgue measure) of the F-B partition, and we\nshow that it is the same as d(Omega-F-B), which permits conjecturing on the\nuniversality of the dimensional value d approximately equal to 0.87.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Nov 2007 00:53:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-11-20"}
