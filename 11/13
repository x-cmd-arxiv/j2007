The lack of radial accuracy in\nthese surveys can be modelled by picturing the universe as a set of concentric\nradial shells of finite width around the observer, i.e, an onion-like\nstructure. We present a new N-body simulation with 2048^3 particles developed\nat the Marenostrum supercomputer with the GADGET-2 code. Using the lightcone\noutput we build a set of angular maps that mimic this onion-like representation\nof the universe. The onion maps are a highly compressed version of the raw data\n(i.e. a factor >1000 smaller size for arcminute resolution maps) and they\nprovide a new and powerful tool to exploit large scale structure observations.\nWe introduce two basic applications of these maps that are especially useful\nfor constraning dark energy properties: the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO)\nin the galaxy power spectrum and all-sky maps of the weak lensing distortion.\nUsing the weak lensing maps, we measure the convergence power spectra and\ncompare it to halo fit predictions. As a further application, we compute the\nvariance and higher-order moments of the maps. We show that sampling variance\non scales of few degrees is quite large, resulting in a significant (25% at 10\narminute scales) bias in the variance. We caution that current lensing surveys\nsuch as the COSMOS HST should take into account this bias and extra sampling\nerror in their clustering analyses and inferred cosmological parameter\nconstraints. Finally, we test the importance of projection effects in the weak\nlensing mass reconstruction. On the mean, the mass calibration works well but\nit exhibits a large non-Gaussian scatter what could induce a large bias in the\nrecovered mass function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2007 20:49:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2008 17:31:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 2008 17:04:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The purpose of this paper is to examine the step\nbeyond the ponctual approximation for the tidal perturber. To achieve this aim,\nthe gravitational interaction between two extended bodies and more precisely\nthe interaction between mass multipole moments of their gravitational fields\nand the associated tidal phenomena are studied. Use of Cartesian Symmetric\nTrace Free (STF) tensors, of their relation with spherical harmonics and of the\nKaula's transform enables to derive analytically the tidal and mutual\ninteraction potentials as well as the associated disturbing functions in\nextended bodies systems. The tidal and mutual interaction potentials of two\nextended bodies are derived. Next, the external gravitational potential of such\ntidally disturbed extended body is obtained, using the Love's number theory, as\nwell as the associated disturbing function. Finally, the dynamical evolution\nequations for such systems are given in their more general form without any\nlinearization. The dynamical equations for the gravitational and tidal\ninteractions between extended bodies and associated dynamics are derived in a\nform where they could be directly implemented to perform coherent numerical\nsimulations of planetary systems or multiple stars tidal evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2007 16:06:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Oct 2008 15:14:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 12 Dec 2008 16:50:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-12"}

In particular, when the transverse\nfield is parallel to the magnetic moments within the domain wall, the velocity\nof the wall varies linearly with the strength of the transverse field\nincreasing by up to 20%. Further examination of the domain wall structure shows\nthat the length of the domain wall also depends linearly on the strength of the\ntransverse field. We present a simple model to correlate the effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2007 21:08:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Accretion initially proceeds at high rates of\n10^{-6}-10^{-5} M_Sun/yr resulting in strong irradiation of the stellar surface\nby the hot inner portion of the disk and leading to the suppression of the\nintrinsic stellar luminosity. Here we investigate how this luminosity\nsuppression affects evolution of the protostellar properties. Using simple\nmodel based on the energy balance of accreting star we demonstrate that disk\nirradiation causes only a slight increase of the protostellar radius, at the\nlevel of several per cent. Such a weak effect is explained by a minor role\nplayed by the intrinsic stellar luminosity (at the time when it is\nsignificantly altered by irradiation) in the protostellar energy budget\ncompared to the stellar deuterium burning luminosity and the inflow of the\ngravitational potential energy brought in by the freshly accreted material. Our\nresults justify the neglect of irradiation effects in previous studies of the\nprotostellar growth via disk accretion. Evolution of some other actively\naccreting objects such as young brown dwarfs and planets should also be only\nweakly sensitive to the effects of disk irradiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2007 21:11:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The median intrinsic 24 micron\nflux density of the sample is 130 microJy, enabling a systematic survey of the\nspectral properties of the very faint 24 micron sources that dominate the\nnumber counts of Spitzer cosmological surveys. Six of the 19 galaxy spectra\n(32%) show the strong mid-IR continuua expected of AGN; X-ray detections\nconfirm the presence of AGN in three of these cases, and reveal AGNs in two\nother galaxies. These results suggest that nuclear accretion may contribute\nmore flux to faint 24 micron--selected samples than previously assumed. Almost\nall the spectra show some aromatic (PAH) emission features; the measured\naromatic flux ratios do not show evolution from z=0. In particular, the high\nS/N mid-IR spectrum of SMM J163554.2+661225 agrees remarkably well with\nlow--redshift, lower--luminosity templates. We compare the rest-frame 8 micron\nand total infrared luminosities of star--forming galaxies, and find that the\nbehavior of this ratio with total IR luminosity has evolved modestly from z=2\nto z=0. Since the high aromatic--to--continuum flux ratios in these galaxies\nrule out a dominant contribution by AGN, this finding implies systematic\nevolution in the structure and/or metallicity of infrared sources with\nredshift. It also has implications for the estimates of star forming rates\ninferred from 24 micron measurements, in the sense that at z ~2, a given\nobserved frame 24 micron luminosity corresponds to a lower bolometric\nluminosity than would be inferred from low-redshift templates of similar\nluminosity at the corresponding rest wavelength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2007 02:05:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In the\nchaotic regime oscillatory activity undergoes fast temporal decorrelation. The\ngenerality of these dynamical properties is assessed in firing-rate models as\nwell as in large networks of conductance-based neurons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2007 15:01:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

It could lead to major discoveries by using demonstrated\ntechnologies. The mission proposes to perform a set of precision gravitation\nexperiments from the vicinity of Earth to the outer Solar System. Its\nscientific objectives can be summarized as follows: i) test of the gravity\nforce law in the Solar System up to and beyond the orbit of Saturn; ii) precise\ninvestigation of navigation anomalies at the fly-bys; iii) measurement of\nEddington's parameter at occultations; iv) mapping of gravity field in the\nouter solar system and study of the Kuiper belt. To this aim, the Odyssey\nmission is built up on a main spacecraft, designed to fly up to 13 AU, with the\nfollowing components: a) a high-precision accelerometer, with bias-rejection\nsystem, measuring the deviation of the trajectory from the geodesics; b)\nKa-band transponders, as for Cassini, for a precise range and Doppler\nmeasurement up to 13 AU, with additional VLBI equipment; c) optional laser\nequipment, which would allow one to improve the range and Doppler measurement.\nIn this baseline concept, the main spacecraft is designed to operate beyond the\nSaturn orbit, up to 13 AU. It experiences multiple planetary fly-bys at Earth,\nMars or Venus, and Jupiter. The cruise and fly-by phases allow the mission to\nachieve its baseline scientific objectives (i) to iii) in the above list). In\naddition to this baseline concept, the Odyssey mission proposes the release of\nthe Enigma radio-beacon at Saturn, allowing one to extend the deep space\ngravity test up to at least 50 AU, while achieving the scientific objective of\na mapping of gravity field in the outer Solar System.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2007 15:28:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2008 17:33:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-12"}

The\ndisorder averaged local density of states is almost perfectly homogeneous when\nintegrated only over states which contribute to the ``nodal'' spectral weight\nwhereas it displays long range charge stripe order when integrated only over\nstates which contribute to the ``antinodal'' spectral weight. An effectively\ntwo dimensional nodal liquid can thus coexist with static charge stripes\nprovided there is no static spin order.
