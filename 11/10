Both instabilities involve convective motions and hence\ncan trigger dynamo actions which may be responsible for the large magnetic\nfields in neutron stars and magnetars. We have solved the mean-field induction\nequation in a simplified one-dimensional model of both the convective and the\nneutron-finger instability zones. Although very idealized, the model includes\nthe nonlinearities introduced by the feedback processes which tend to saturate\nthe growth of the magnetic field (alpha-quenching) and suppress its turbulent\ndiffusion (eta-quenching). The possibility of a dynamo action is studied within\na dynamical model of turbulent diffusivity where the boundary of the unstable\nzone is allowed to move. We show that the dynamo action can be operative and\nthat the amplification of the magnetic field can still be very effective.\nFurthermore, we confirm the existence of a critical spin-period, below which\nthe dynamo is always excited independently of the degree of differential\nrotation, and whose value is related to the size of the neutron-finger\ninstability zone. Finally we provide a relation for the intensity of the final\nfield as a function of the spin of the star and of its differential rotation.\nAlthough they were obtained by using a toy model, we expect that our results\nare able to capture the qualitative and asymptotic behaviour of a mean-field\ndynamo action developing in the neutron-finger instability zone.

In these\ncontinua, the points of which carry independent translational and rotational\ndegrees of freedom, there occur, besides ordinary (force) stresses,\nadditionally spin moment stresses. In a 3-dimensional continuized crystal with\ndislocation lines, a linear connection can be introduced that takes the crystal\nlattice structure as a basis for parallelism. Such a continuum has similar\nproperties as a Cosserat continuum, and the dislocation density is equal to the\ntorsion of this connection.

Because the sources were\nrare and bright (with the photon budget dominated by quasars with luminosities\nL>L_\\star), random fluctuations in the quasar population determined the\nmorphology of ionized gas when the global ionized fraction x_i was small, with\nthe typical radius R_c of a HeIII bubble ~15-20 comoving Mpc. Only when x_i>0.5\ndid the large-scale clustering of the quasars drive the characteristic size of\nionized regions above this value. Still later, when x_i>0.75, most ionizing\nphotons were consumed by dense, recombining systems before they reached the\nedge of their source's ionized surroundings, halting the bubble growth when\nR_c~35-40 Mpc. These phases are qualitatively similar to those in hydrogen\nreionization, but the rarity of the sources makes the early stochastic phase\nmuch more important. Moreover, the well-known characteristics of the z=3\nintergalactic medium allow a much more robust description of the late phase in\nwhich recombinations dominate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2007 21:23:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Apr 2008 04:31:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

However its ratio of\nbaryons (i.e. gas + stellar) mass to dark mass is typical of that in galaxies.\nOur new high-resolution HI images of the galaxy show evidence for a large scale\n(purely gaseous) spiral arm and central bar. Despite the gaseous spiral feature\nand the on-going star formation, we find that the global gas density in NGC\n3741 is significantly lower than the Toomre instability criterion. We also find\nthat the star formation rate is consistent with that expected from the observed\ncorrelations between HI mass and SFR and the global Kennicutt-Schmidt law\nrespectively. We measure the oxygen abundance to be 12+ log(O/H)=7.66$\\pm$0.10,\nwhich is consistent with that expected from the metallicity-luminosity\nrelation, despite its extreme gas mass ratio. We also examine the issue of\nchemical evolution of NGC 3741 in the context of closed-box model of chemical\nevolution. The effective oxygen yield of NGC 3741 is consistent with recent\nmodel estimates of closed-box yields, provided one assumes that the gas has\nbeen efficiently mixed all the way to edge of the HI disk (i.e. >8 times the\noptical radius). This seems a priori unlikely. On the other hand, using a\nsample of galaxies with both interferometric HI maps and chemical abundance\nmeasurements, we find that the effective yield is anti-correlated with the\ntotal dynamical mass, as expected in leaky box models (slightly abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Nov 2007 11:39:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We use the model developed by Gersten and Nitzan, that we correct\nfor radiative reaction and dynamic depolarization and extend for prolate\nparticle shapes. We show that prolate-shaped metal nanoparticles can lead to\nmuch higher quantum efficiency enhancements than corresponding spherical\nnanoparticles. For properly engineered emitter-nanoparticle geometries, quantum\nefficiency enhancements from an initial value of 1% (in absence of the\nnanoparticle) to 70% are feasible. We describe the anisotropy-induced\nenhancement effects in terms of large field enhancements near the metal tips\nthat cause strong coupling to the (radiative) dipolar modes. For increasing\nparticle anisotropy, a strong spectral separation between radiative dipolar and\ndark higher-order modes occurs, which leads to higher radiative efficiencies\nfor anisotropic particles. In addition, we demonstrate that for large (> 100\nnm) nanoparticles, the influence of Ohmic losses on plasmon-enhanced\nluminescence is substantially reduced, which implies that, if prolate shaped,\neven lossy metals such as Al and Cu are suitable materials for optical\nnano-antennas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Nov 2007 12:31:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-11-13"}
