We originally proved this theorem in a\npaper with Martin; the presentation of the proof here contains omitted proof\ndetails and revised exposition. We also give a survey of the extant results on\nautomorphism groups of finite $p$-groups, focusing on the order of the\nautomorphism groups and on known examples. Finally, we explore a connection\nbetween automorphisms of finite $p$-groups and Markov chains. Specifically, we\ndefine a family of Markov chains on an elementary abelian $p$-group and bound\nthe convergence rate of some of those chains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Nov 2007 20:00:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-11-20"}

Here, we\nreport our optical and infrared observations during the first-ever outburst of\na new dwarf nova, SDSS J102146.44+234926.3.

The magnetic field direction\nin the simulation is compared directly with the chirality of observed\nfilaments, at their observed locations. In our model the coronal field evolves\nthrough a continuous sequence of nonlinear force-free equilibria, in response\nto the changing photospheric boundary conditions and the emergence of new\nmagnetic flux. In total 119 magnetic bipoles with properties matching observed\nactive regions are inserted. These bipoles emerge twisted and inject magnetic\nhelicity into the solar atmosphere. When we choose the sign of this\nactive-region helicity to match that observed in each hemisphere, the model\nproduces the correct chirality for up to 96% of filaments, including exceptions\nto the hemispheric pattern. If the emerging bipoles have zero helicity, or\nhelicity of the opposite sign, then this percentage is much reduced. In\naddition, the simulation produces a higher proportion of filaments with the\ncorrect chirality after longer times. This indicates that a key element in the\nevolution of the coronal field is its long-term memory, and the build-up and\ntransport of helicity from low to high latitudes over many months. It\nhighlights the importance of continuous evolution of the coronal field, rather\nthan independent extrapolations at different times. This has significant\nconsequences for future modelling such as that related to the origin and\ndevelopment of coronal mass ejections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2007 10:18:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Star clusters of different\nages, structure and mass functions are modelled by assuming that the radial\ndistribution of stars follows a pre-defined analytical form. Near-infrared\nsurface brightness and mass-density profiles result from mass-luminosity\nrelations taken from a set of isochrones. Core, tidal and half-light, half-mass\nand half-star count radii, together with the concentration parameter, are\nmeasured in the three types of profiles, which are built under different\nphotometric depths. While surface-brightness profiles are almost insensitive to\nphotometric depth, radii measured in number-density and mass-density profiles\nchange significantly with it. Compared to radii derived with deep photometry,\nshallow profiles result in lower values. This effect increases for younger\nages. Radial profiles of clusters with a spatially-uniform mass function\nproduce radii that do not depend on depth.

We develop a pragmatic approximation in\norder to enable multi-dimensional simulations with basic spectral radiative\ntransfer when the computational resources are not sufficient to solve the\ncomplete Boltzmann transport equation. The distribution function of the\ntransported particles is decomposed into trapped and streaming particle\ncomponents. Their separate evolution equations are coupled by a source term\nthat converts trapped particles into streaming particles. We determine this\nsource term by requiring the correct diffusion limit. For a smooth transition\nto the free streaming regime, this 'diffusion source' is limited by the matter\nemissivity. The resulting streaming particle emission rates are integrated over\nspace to obtain the streaming particle flux. A geometric estimate of the flux\nfactor is used to convert the particle flux to the streaming particle density.\nThe efficiency of the scheme results from the freedom to use different\napproximations for each particle component. In supernovae, reactions with\ntrapped particles on fast time scales establish equilibria that reduce the\nnumber of primitive variables required to evolve the trapped particle\ncomponent. On the other hand, a stationary-state approximation facilitates the\ntreatment of the streaming particle component. Different approximations may\napply in applications to stellar atmospheres, star formation, or cosmological\nradiative transfer.
