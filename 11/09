No\ngeometric information is lost since two precubical sets are isomorphic if and\nonly if the associated flows are weakly equivalent.

First, we need to\nunderstand what synthesis models actually compute: we show that a synthetic\nstellar population with fixed physical parameters (age, metallicity, star\nformation history, initial mass function and size of the system) can only be\ndescribed in terms of probability distributions (i.e. there is an intrinsic\ndispersion in any model). Second, we need to identify and characterize the\ncoverage in the parameter space of the models (i.e. the combinations of input\nparameters that yield meaningful models) and the different sources of\nsystematic errors. Third, we need a way to describe quantitatively the\nintrinsic dispersion, the systematic error and the parameter space coverage of\nthe models.\n  Up to now, the parameter space coverage and uncertainties have been described\nqualitatively in the models' reference papers, with potential\nmisinterpretations by models' users. We show how Virtual Observatory\ndevelopments enable a correct use of synthesis models to obtain accurate (and\nnot simply precise) results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2007 21:00:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-11-12"}

The sense of the deviation is such\nthat bright galaxies (M_B < -20) typically show central light deficits with\nrespect to the inward extrapolation of the Sersic model, while the great\nmajority of low- and intermediate-luminosity galaxies (-19.5 < M_B < -15) show\ncentral light excesses; galaxies occupying a narrow range of intermediate\nluminosities (-20 < M_B < -19.5) are usually well fitted by Sersic models over\nall radii. The slopes of the central surface brightness profiles, when measured\nat fixed fractions of R_e, vary smoothly as a function of galaxy luminosity in\na manner that depends sensitively on the choice of measurement radius. We show\nthat a recent claim of strong bimodality in slope is likely an artifact of the\ngalaxy selection function used in that study.

A tree decomposition can be\nextended to a tree realization, i.e., a cycle-free realization of the code on\nthe underlying tree, by specifying a state space at each edge of the tree, and\na local constraint code at each vertex of the tree. The constraint complexity\nof a tree realization is the maximum dimension of any of its local constraint\ncodes. A measure of the complexity of maximum-likelihood decoding for a code is\nits treewidth, which is the least constraint complexity of any of its tree\nrealizations.\n  It is known that among all tree realizations of a code that extends a given\ntree decomposition, there exists a unique minimal realization that minimizes\nthe state space dimension at each vertex of the underlying tree.

However, these observations are\nchallenging because the low space densities of these objects necessitate\nsurveying of large areas, in order to obtain statistically meaningful samples,\nwhile at the same time cosmological redshifting and dimming means that rather\ndeep Near Infrared (NIR) imaging must be carried out. Several upcoming and\nproposed facilities with wide-field NIR imaging capabilities will open up this\nnew region of parameter space. In this paper we present predictions for the\nexpected number counts of z>5 QSOs, based on simple empirical and\nsemi-empirical models of QSO evolution, as a function of redshift, depth and\nsurveyed area.

Careful background study showed no\npositive detection of the extended hard X-rays previously reported with ASCA,\nin 5--12 keV with XIS and 12--40 keV with HXD-PIN, although our upper limit did\nnot exclude the ASCA result. There is an indication that the X-ray intensity in\n$r<3.3'$ region is $70\\pm 19$% higher than the nominal CXB level (5--12 keV),\nand Chandra and Suzaku data suggest that most of this excess could be due to\nconcentration of hard X-ray sources with an average photon index of\n$\\Gamma=1.38\\pm 0.06$. Cumulative mass of O, Fe and Mg in the group gas and the\nmetal mass-to-light ratio were derived and compared with those in other groups.\nPossible role of AGN or galaxy mergers in this group is also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2007 12:39:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-18"}

This peculiar effect is a direct consequence of the\nweak intermolecular interaction which is characteristic of organic\nsemiconductors. Pentacene thin-film transistors were fabricated and\ncharacterized by in situ gated four-terminal measurements. Under high vacuum\nconditions (base pressure of order 10E-8 mbar), the device performance is found\nto improve with time. The effective field-effect mobility increases by as much\nas a factor of two and mobilities up to 0.45 cm2/Vs were achieved. In addition,\nthe contact resistance decreases by more than an order of magnitude and there\nis a significant reduction in current hysteresis. Oxygen/nitrogen exposure and\nannealing experiments show the improvement of the electronic parameters to be\ndriven by a thermally promoted process and not by chemical doping. In order to\nextract the spectral density of trap states from the transistor\ncharacteristics, we have implemented a powerful scheme which allows for a\ncalculation of the trap densities with high accuracy in a straightforward\nfashion. We show the performance improvement to be due to a reduction in the\ndensity of shallow traps <0.15 eV from the valence band edge, while the\nenergetically deeper traps are essentially unaffected.

The most fundamental\nspin-dependent nteraction in nonmagnetic semiconductors is spin-orbit coupling.\nDepending on the crystal symmetries of the material, as well as on the\nstructural properties of semiconductor based heterostructures, the spin-orbit\ncoupling takes on different functional forms, giving a nice playground of\neffective spin-orbit Hamiltonians.

These resonances appear\nbecause the ferromagnets are half-metallic, so that the Fermi level can be\nplaced above the majority but below the minority spin band. In that case, the\nmajority spins will be propagating, but the minority spins will be evanescent.\nAt low temperatures, the Fano resonances can be exploited to implement a\ndigital binary switch that can be turned on or off with a very small gate\nvoltage swing of few tens of microvolts, leading to extremely small dynamic\npower dissipation during switching. An array of 500,000 x 500,000 such\ntransistors can detect ultrasmall changes in a magnetic field with a\nsensitivity of 1 femto-Tesla/sqrt{Hz}, if each transistor is biased near a Fano\nresonance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2007 14:53:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
