These results are combined with\nground-based observations of the J=1-0 transitions of 12CO and 13CO obtained at\nthe FCRAO and, for a subset of the outflows, data from ISO. Assuming the SWAS\nwater line emission originates from the same gas traced by CO emission, we find\nthat the outflowing gas in most outflows has an o-H2O abundance relative to H2\nof between 10(-7) and 10(-6). Analysis of the water abundance as a function of\noutflow velocity reveals a strong dependence. The water abundance increases\nwith velocity, and at the highest outflow velocities some outflows have\nrelative o-H2O abundances of order 10(-4). However the mass of gas with such\nelevated water abundances represents less that 1% of the total outflow gas\nmass. The ISO LWS observations of high-J rotational lines of CO and the 179.5\nmicron transition of o-H2O provide evidence for a warmer outflow component than\nrequired to produce either the SWAS or FCRAO lines. The mass associated with\nthe ISO emission is similar to that responsible for the highest velocity water\nemission detected by SWAS. The bulk of the outflowing gas has an abundance of\no-H2O well below what would be expected if the gas has passed through a C-shock\nwith shock velocities greater than 10 km/s. Gas-phase water can be depleted in\nthe post-shock gas due to freeze-out onto grain mantles, however the rate of\nfreeze-out is too slow to explain our results. Therefore we believe that only a\nsmall fraction of the outflowing molecular gas has passed through shocks strong\nenough to fully convert the gas-phase oxygen to water. This result has\nimplications for the acceleration mechanism of the molecular gas in these\noutflows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2007 19:49:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

A key feature of these schemes is that\nthey make use of genuinely multidimensional (approximate) Riemann solvers as\nopposed to the piecemeal 1D Riemann solvers usually employed by finite volume\nmethods. In 1D, LeVeque and Pelanti [J. Comp. Phys. 172, 572 (2001)] showed\nthat many of the standard approximate Riemann solver methods (e.g., the Roe\nsolver, HLL, Lax-Friedrichs) can be obtained from applying an exact Riemann\nsolver to relaxation systems of the type introduced by Jin and Xin [Comm.

In this work we extend LeVeque and Pelanti's\nresults and obtain a multidimensional relaxation system from which\nmultidimensional approximate Riemann solvers can be obtained. In particular, we\nshow that with one choice of parameters the relaxation system yields the\nstandard N-scheme. With another choice, the relaxation system yields a new\nRiemann solver, which can be viewed as a genuinely multidimensional extension\nof the local Lax-Friedrichs scheme. This new Riemann solver does not require\nthe use Roe-Struijs-Deconinck averages, nor does it require the inversion of an\nm-by-m matrix in each computational grid cell, where $m$ is the number of\nconserved variables. Once this new scheme is established, we apply it on a few\nstandard cases for the 2D compressible Euler equations of gas dynamics.

There is emerging evidence indicating\nthat cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition limits BBB disruption following ischemic\nstroke and bacterial meningitis, but the mechanisms involved are not known. We\nused intracerebral injection of TNF-a to study the effect of COX inhibition on\nTNF-a-induced BBB breakdown, MMP expression/activity and oxidative stress. BBB\ndisruption was evaluated by the uptake of 14C-sucrose into the brain and by\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) utilizing Gd-DTPA as a paramagnetic contrast\nagent. Using selective inhibitors of each COX isoform, we found that COX-1\nactivity is more important than COX-2 in BBB opening. TNF-a induced a\nsignificant upregulation of gelatinase B (MMP-9), stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) and\nCOX-2. In addition, TNF-a significantly depleted glutathione as compared to\nsaline. Indomethacin (10 mg/kg; i.p.), an inhibitor of COX-1 and COX-2, reduced\nBBB damage at 24 h.

Samples of\nthe plenoptic function (POF) are seen in video and in general visual content,\nand represent large amounts of information. In this paper we propose a\nstochastic model to study the compression limits of the plenoptic function. In\nthe proposed framework, we isolate the two fundamental sources of information\nin the POF: the one representing the camera motion and the other representing\nthe information complexity of the \"reality\" being acquired and transmitted. The\nsources of information are combined, generating a stochastic process that we\nstudy in detail. We first propose a model for ensembles of realities that do\nnot change over time. The proposed model is simple in that it enables us to\nderive precise coding bounds in the information-theoretic sense that are sharp\nin a number of cases of practical interest. For this simple case of static\nrealities and camera motion, our results indicate that coding practice is in\naccordance with optimal coding from an information-theoretic standpoint. The\nmodel is further extended to account for visual realities that change over\ntime. We derive bounds on the lossless and lossy information rates for this\ndynamic reality model, stating conditions under which the bounds are tight.\nExamples with synthetic sources suggest that in the presence of scene dynamics,\nsimple hybrid coding using motion/displacement estimation with DPCM performs\nconsiderably suboptimally relative to the true rate-distortion bound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2007 02:54:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2007 02:53:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2009 18:11:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-08"}

After correction for reddening, the steady state AGN optical--UV\nspectral energy distributions (SEDs) are very similar. The SEDs are dominated\nenergetically by the big blue bump (BBB), but this bump never shows the\nnu^{+1/3} spectrum predicted for a standard thin accretion disk with a\nr^{-0.75} radial temperature gradient. Instead, the observed optical-UV SED\nimplies a temperature gradient of r^{-0.57} independent of the thickness of the\ndisk. This means that there is some flow of heat outwards in the disk. The disk\nis large and the region emitting the optical continuum is as large as the inner\nbroad-line region (BLR). Because optical variability is seen in all AGNs on the\nlight-crossing time of the BLR, variations must propagate at close to the speed\nof light, rather than on dynamical timescales. This argues that the\nenergy-generation mechanism is electromagnetic rather that hydrodynamic. Since\nthe velocities are near the speed of light, there can be significant local\nanisotropy in the emission. The large rapid variations of the BBB imply that\nthe magnetohydrodynamic energy generation is fundamentally unstable. Because of\nthe inevitable radial temperature gradient in the accreting material, different\nspectral regions come predominantly from different radii, and variations in\ndifferent spectral regions correspond to variability at different radii. This\nexplains the frequently observed independence of X-ray and optical variations,\ncases of variability at lower energies leading variability at higher energies,\nand rapid changes in emission-line reverberation lags.

At\nthe onset, the system should relax to Einstein phase at late times as the\neffect of Gauss-Bonnet term becomes negligible in the low energy regime.\nHowever, we find that most of the trajectories emerging from the standard\nbig-bang singularity lead to future re-collapse whereas the system beginning\nits evolution from the non-standard singularity enters the Kasner regime at\nlate times.

We estimated the contribution of the limb-darkening and\nstar-spot effects on the final results. We concluded that although the limb\ndarkening increases by ~0.02-0.03 % the transit depths, and the differential\neffects between the two IRAC bands is even smaller, 0.01 %. Furthermore, the\nhost star is known to be an active spotted K star with observed photometric\nmodulation. If we adopt an extreme model of 20 % coverage with spots 1000K\ncooler of the star surface, it will make the observed transits shallower by\n0.19 and 0.18 %. The difference between the two bands will be only of 0.01 %,\nin the opposite direction to the limb darkening correction. If the transit\ndepth is affected by limb darkening and spots, the differential effects between\nthe 3.6 and 5.8 microns bands are very small. The differential transit depths\nat 3.6 and 5.8 microns and the recent one published by Knutson et al.(2007) at\n8 microns are in agreement with the presence of water vapour in the upper\natmosphere of the planet.

There is a general consent\nthat colours, and spectral features, most notably the 4000 A break, can predict\nmany properties of galaxies, including star formation rates and hence they\ncould infer some of the line properties. We argue that these techniques have\ngreat prospects in helping us understand line emission in extragalactic objects\nand might speed up future galaxy redshift surveys if they are to target\nemission line objects only. We use two independent methods, Artifical Neural\nNeworks (based on the ANNz code) and Locally Weighted Regression (LWR), to\nretrieve correlations present in the colour N-dimensional space and to predict\nthe equivalent widths present in the corresponding spectra. We also investigate\nhow well it is possible to separate galaxies with and without lines from broad\nband photometry only. We find, unsurprisingly, that recombination lines can be\nwell predicted by galaxy colours. However, among collisional lines some can and\nsome cannot be predicted well from galaxy colours alone, without any further\nredshift information. We also use our techniques to estimate how much\ninformation contained in spectral diagnostic diagrams can be recovered from\nbroad-band photometry alone. We find that it is possible to classify AGN and\nstar formation objects relatively well using colours only. We suggest that this\ntechnique could be used to considerably improve redshift surveys such as the\nupcoming FMOS survey and the planned WFMOS survey.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2007 11:14:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

A model of a relativistic\nproton-like wave function, dependent on valence quark longitudinal and\ntransverse momenta and on quark helicities, is proposed, and we derive the\nbaryon impact factors for two, three and four t-channel gluons. We find that\nthe baryonic impact factor can be written as a sum of three pieces: in the\nfirst one a subsystem consisting of two of the three quarks behaves very much\nlike the quark-antiquark pair in gamma* scattering, whereas the third quark\nacts as a spectator. The second term belongs to the odderon, whereas in the\nthird (C-even) piece all three quarks participate in the scattering. This term\nis new and has no analogue in gamma* scattering. We also study the small x\nevolution of gluon radiation for each of these three terms. The first term\nfollows the same pattern of gluon radiation as the gamma*-initiated\nquark-antiquark dipole, and, in particular, it contains the BFKL evolution\nfollowed by the 2-->4 transition vertex (triple Pomeron vertex). The\nodderon-term is described by the standard BKP evolution, and the baryon couples\nto both known odderon solutions, the Janik-Wosiek solution and the BLV\nsolution. Finally, the t-channel evolution of the third term starts with a\nthree reggeized gluon state which then, via a new 3-->4 transition vertex,\ncouples to the four gluon (two-Pomeron) state.

With the Solar Optical Telescope on Hinode, we investigate the basic\nproperties of high-degree solar oscillations observed at two levels in the\nsolar atmosphere, in the G-band (formed in the photosphere) and in the Ca II H\nline (chromospheric emission).\n  Methods. We analyzed the data by calculating the individual power spectra as\nwell as the cross-spectral properties, i.e., coherence and phase shift. The\nobservational properties are compared with a simple theoretical model, which\nincludes the effects of correlated noise.\n  Results. The results reveal significant frequency shifts between the Ca II H\nand G-band spectra, in particular above the acoustic cut-off frequency for\npseudo-modes. The cross-spectrum phase shows peaks associated with the acoustic\noscillation (p-mode) lines, and begins to increase with frequency around the\nacoustic cut-off. However, we find no phase shift for the (surface gravity\nwave) f-mode. The observed properties for the p-modes are qualitatively\nreproduced in a simple model with a correlated background if the correlated\nnoise level in the Ca II H data is higher than in the G-band data.

At time zero the harmonic oscillators are in their ground state and the\ntest particle is in a superposition state of two wave packets centered in the\norigin with opposite mean momentum. %$\\pm M v_0$. Under suitable assumptions on\nthe physical parameters of the model, we consider the time evolution of the\nwave function and we compute the probability $\\mathcal{P}^{-}_{n_1 n_2} (t)$\n(resp. $\\mathcal{P}^{+}_{n_1 n_2} (t)$) that both oscillators are in the\nexcited states labelled by $n_1$, $n_2 >0$ at time $t > |a_2| v_0^{-1}$ when\n$a_2 <0$ (resp. $a_2 >0$). We prove that $\\mathcal{P}_{n_1 n_2}^- (t)$ is\nnegligible with respect to $\\mathcal{P}_{n_1 n_2}^+ (t)$, up to second order in\ntime dependent perturbation theory. The system we consider is a simplified, one\ndimensional version of the original model of a cloud chamber introduced by Mott\nin \\cite{m}, where the result was argued using euristic arguments in the\nframework of the time independent perturbation theory for the stationary\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation. The method of the proof is entirely elementary and it\nis essentially based on a stationary phase argument. We also remark that all\nthe computations refer to the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation for the three-particle\nsystem, with no reference to the wave packet collapse postulate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2007 15:44:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-11-15"}
