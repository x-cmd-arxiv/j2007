Recent measurements of the elongation rates\nby the Pierre Auger Observatory hint at the possible presence of heavy or\nintermediate mass nuclei in the UHE cosmic rays. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and\nhypernovae have been suggested as possible sources of the UHE cosmic rays. Here\nwe derive the constraints on the physical conditions under which UHE heavy\nnuclei, if they are accelerated in these sources, can survive in their intense\nphoton fields. We find that in the GRB external shock and in the hypernova\nscenarios, UHE nuclei can easily survive photo-disintegration. In the GRB\ninternal shock scenario, UHE nuclei can also survive, provided the dissipation\nradius and/or the bulk Lorentz factor of the relativistic outflow are\nrelatively large, or if the low-energy self-absorption break in the photon\nspectrum of the prompt emission occurs above several KeV. In internal shocks\nand in the other scenarios, intermediate-mass UHE nuclei have a higher\nprobability of survival against photo-disintegration than UHE heavy nuclei such\nas Fe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2007 19:38:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 Dec 2007 14:20:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2008 01:38:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-11"}

In this work, we used all available WET photometric data\nfrom 1983, 1985, 1989, 1993 and 2002 to identify the pulsation periods and\nidentified 76 additional pulsation modes, increasing to 198 the number of known\npulsation modes in PG 1159-035, the largest number of modes detected in any\nstar besides the Sun.

AIMS: The discovery of a second PN candidate,\nassociated with one of the 5 globular clusters in the Fornax dwarf, is\nreported. METHODS: Spectra of the globular cluster H5, obtained with the UVES\nechelle spectrograph on the ESO Very Large Telescope, show [O III] line\nemission at a radial velocity consistent with membership of the Fornax dwarf. A\npossible counterpart of the [O III] emission is identified in archival images\nfrom the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 on board the Hubble Space Telescope. The\nsource of the emission is located about 1.5\" (less than one core radius)\nsouthwest of the centre of the cluster. RESULTS: The emission line source is\nidentified as a likely PN, albeit with several peculiar properties. No Hbeta,\nHe I, or He II line emission is detected and the [O III]/Hbeta ratio is >25 (2\nsigma). The expansion velocity inferred from the [O III] 5007 AA line is about\n55 km/s, which is large for a PN. The diameter measured on the HST images is\nabout 0.23\" or 0.15 pc at the distance of the Fornax dSph.

By comparing the rotational velocity\ndistributions of the Magellanic Cloud stars to a similar Galactic sample we\nfind that (at 3sigma confidence level) massive stars (above 8Msun) in the SMC\nrotate faster than those in the solar neighbourhood. However there appears to\nbe no significant difference between the rotational velocity distributions in\nthe Galaxy and the LMC. We find that the vsini distributions in the SMC and LMC\ncan modelled with an intrinsic rotational velocity distribution which is a\nGaussian peaking at 175km/s (SMC) and 100km/s (LMC). We find that in NGC346 in\nthe SMC, the 10-25Msun main-sequence stars appear to rotate faster than their\nhigher mass counterparts. Recently Yoon et al. (2006) have determined rates of\nGRBs by modelling rapidly rotating massive star progenitors. Our measured\nrotational velocity distribution for the 10-25Msun stars is peaked at slightly\nhigher velocities than they assume, supporting the idea that GRBs could come\nfrom rapid rotators with initial masses as low as 14Msun at low metallicities.\n(abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2007 18:11:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

On the\nother hand, having in mind the adiabatic picture of the systems, our results\nsuggest the possible formation of these molecules as resonant states in\nAntihydrogen-Atom interaction.

Given a series of\nstellar spectra obtained over various phases of the planetary orbit, the goal\nis to measure the strength of the component scattered by the planet relative to\nthe component coming directly from the star. We use two complementary\nstrategies, both of which rely on the predictable Doppler shifts of both\ncomponents and on combining the results from many spectral lines and many\nexposures. In the first strategy, we identify segments of the stellar spectrum\nthat are free of direct absorption lines and add them after Doppler-shifting\ninto the planetary frame. In the second strategy, we compare the distribution\nof equivalent-width ratios of the scattered and direct components. Both\nstrategies are calibrated with a ``null test'' in which scrambled Doppler\nshifts are applied to the spectral segments. As an illustrative test case, we\napply our technique to spectra of HD 209458 taken when the planet was near\nopposition (with orbital phases ranging from 11 to 34$\\arcdeg$, where\n0$\\arcdeg$ is at opposition), finding that the planet-to-star flux ratio is\n$(1.4 \\pm 2.9)\\times10^{-4}$ in the wavelength range 554$-$681 nm. This\ncorresponds to a geometric albedo of $0.8 \\pm 1.6$, assuming the phase function\nof a Lambert sphere. Although the result is not statistically significant, the\nachieved sensitivity and relatively small volume of data upon which it is based\nare very encouraging for future ground-based spectroscopic studies of scattered\nlight from transiting CEGP systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2007 21:02:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-11-16"}

In the model considered, Boolean networks\nevolve via a competition between nodes that punishes those in the majority. It\nis found that finite size networks evolve in a fundamentally different way than\ninfinitely large networks do. The symmetry of the evolutionary dynamics of\ninfinitely large networks that selects for canalizing Boolean functions is\nbroken in the evolutionary dynamics of finite size networks. In finite size\nnetworks there is an additional selection for input inverting Boolean functions\nthat output a value opposite to the majority of input values. These results are\nrevealed through an empirical study of the model that calculates the frequency\nof occurrence of the different possible Boolean functions. Classes of functions\nare found to occur with the same frequency. Those classes depend on the\nsymmetry of the evolutionary dynamics and correspond to orbits of the relevant\nsymmetry group. The empirical results match analytic results, determined by\nutilizing Polya's theorem, for the number of orbits expected in both finite\nsize and infinitely large networks. The reason for the symmetry breaking in the\nevolutionary dynamics is found to be due to the need for nodes in finite size\nnetworks to behave differently in order to cooperate so that the system\ncollectively performs as well as possible. The results suggest that both finite\nsize effects and symmetry are important for understanding the evolution of\nreal-world complex networks, including genetic regulatory networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2007 22:44:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

It has been shown that a steep\nsurface-density gradient in the disk, such as the one expected at the boundary\nbetween an active and a dead zone, acts as a planet trap and prevents isolated\ncores from migrating down to the central star. We study the relevance of the\nplanet trap concept for the accretion and evolution of systems of multiple\nplanetary embryos/cores. We performed hydrodynamical simulations of the\nevolution of systems of multiple massive objects in the vicinity of a planet\ntrap. The planetary embryos evolve in 3 dimensions, whereas the disk is modeled\nwith a 2D grid. Synthetic forces are applied onto the embryos to mimic the\ndamping effect that the disk has on their inclinations. Systems with two\nembryos tend to acquire stable, separated and non-migrating orbits, with the\nmore massive embryo placed at the planet trap and the lighter one farther out\nin the disk. Systems of multiple embryos are intrinsically unstable.\nConsequently, a long phase of mutual scattering can lead to accreting\ncollisions among embryos; some embryos are injected into the inner part of the\ndisk, where they can be evacuated into the star by Type I migration. The system\ncan resume a stable, non-migrating configuration only when the number of\nsurviving embryos decreases to a small value (~2-4). This can explain the\nlimited number of giant planets in our solar system. These results should apply\nin general to any case in which the Type-I migration of the inner embryo is\nprevented by some mechanism, and not solely to the planet trap scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2007 06:10:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Taking account of steady flow in solar prominences, we study its\neffects on spatial damping of small-amplitude non-adiabatic magnetoacoustic\nwaves in a homogeneous, isothermal, and unbounded prominence plasma. Methods.\nWe model the typical feature of observed damped oscillatory motion in\nprominences, removing the adiabaticity assumption through thermal conduction,\nradiation and heating. Invoking steady flow in MHD equations, we linearise them\nunder small-amplitude approximation and obtain a new general dispersion\nrelation for linear non-adiabatic magnetoacoustic waves in prominences Results.\nThe presence of steady flow breaks the symmetry of forward and backward\npropagating MHD wave modes in prominences. The steady flow has dramatic\ninfluence on the propagation and damping of magnetoacoustic and thermal waves.\nDepending upon the direction and strength of flow the magnetoacoustic and\nthermal modes can show both the features of wave amplification and damping.

Little is known about their emission mechanism. Large vacuum\ngaps probably exist, and a non-neutral plasma partially fills the neutron star\nsurroundings to form an electrosphere. We showed that the differentially\nrotating equatorial disk in the pulsar's electrosphere is diocotron unstable\nand that it tends to stabilise when relativistic effects are included. However,\nwhen approaching the light cylinder, particle inertia becomes significant and\nthe electric drift approximation is violated. In this paper, we study the most\ngeneral instability, i.e. by including particle inertia effects, as well as\nrelativistic motions. This general non-neutral plasma instability is called the\nmagnetron instability. We linearise the coupled relativistic cold-fluid and\nMaxwell equations. The non-linear eigenvalue problem for the perturbed\nazimuthal electric field component is solved numerically. The spectrum of the\nmagnetron instability in a non-neutral plasma column confined between two\ncylindrically conducting walls is computed for several cylindrical\nconfigurations. For a pulsar electrosphere, no outer wall exists. In this case,\nwe allow for electromagnetic wave emission propagating to infinity.

However, the mechanisms controlling the\nformation of MCs remain controversial. In this contribution, we focus on their\nformation in compressive flows driven by interstellar turbulence and\nlarge-scale gravitational instability. Turbulent compression driven by\nsupernovae appears insufficient to explain the bulk of cloud and star\nformation. Rather, gravity must be important at all scales, driving the\ncompressive flows that form both clouds and cores. Cooling and thermal\ninstability allow the formation of dense gas out of moderate, transonic\ncompressions in the warm diffuse gas, and drive turbulence into the dense\nclouds. MCs may be produced by an overshoot beyond the thermal-pressure\nequilibrium between the cold and warm phases of atomic gas, caused by some\ncombination of the ram pressure of compression and the self-gravity of the\ncompressed gas. In this case, properties of the clouds such as their mass,\nmass-to-magnetic flux ratio, and total kinetic and gravitational energies are\nin general time-variable quantities. MCs may never enter a quasi-equilibrium or\nvirial equilibrium state but rather continuously collapse to stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2007 14:05:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2007 10:01:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-11-26"}

First, it is shown\nthat adding one edge to a cycle definitely decreases the network\nsychronizability. Then, since sometimes the synchronizability can be enhanced\nby changing the network structure, the question of whether the networks with\nmore edges are easier to synchronize is addressed. It is shown by examples that\nthe answer is negative. This reveals that generally there are redundant edges\nin a network, which not only make no contributions to synchronization but\nactually may reduce the synchronizability. Moreover, an example shows that the\nnode betweenness centrality is not always a good indicator for the network\nsynchronizability. Finally, some more examples are presented to illustrate how\nthe network synchronizability varies following the addition of edges, where all\nthe examples show that the network synchronizability globally increases but\nlocally fluctuates as the number of added edges increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2007 15:34:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-11-16"}
