Before Roche densities can be achieved, however, the dust-rich\nlayer, sandwiched from above and below by more slowly rotating dust-poor gas,\nthreatens to overturn and mix by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI).\nWhether such a threat is real has never been demonstrated: the Richardson\ncriterion for the KHI is derived for 2-D Cartesian shear flow and does not\naccount for rotational forces. Here we present 3-D numerical simulations of\ngas-dust mixtures in a shearing box, accounting for the full suite of\ndisk-related forces: the Coriolis and centrifugal forces, and radial tidal\ngravity. Dust particles are assumed small enough to be perfectly entrained in\ngas; the two fluids share the same velocity field but obey separate continuity\nequations. We find that the Richardson number Ri does not alone determine\nstability. The critical value of Ri below which the dust layer overturns and\nmixes depends on the height-integrated metallicity Z (surface density ratio of\ndust to gas). Nevertheless, for Z between one and five times solar, the\ncritical Ri is nearly constant at 0.1. Keplerian radial shear stabilizes those\nmodes that would otherwise disrupt the layer at large Ri. If Z is at least 5\ntimes greater than the solar value of 0.01, then midplane dust densities can\napproach Roche densities. Such an environment might be expected to produce gas\ngiant planets having similarly super-solar metallicities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2007 17:45:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Managing masks with such large\nnumbers of polygons becomes intractably slow, particularly for tasks that run\nin time O(N^2) with a naive algorithm, such as finding which polygons overlap\neach other. Here we present a \"divide-and-conquer\" solution to this challenge:\nwe first split the angular mask into predefined regions called \"pixels,\" such\nthat each polygon is in only one pixel, and then perform further computations,\nsuch as checking for overlap, on the polygons within each pixel separately.\nThis reduces O(N^2) tasks to O(N), and also reduces the important task of\ndetermining in which polygon(s) a point on the sky lies from O(N) to O(1),\nresulting in significant computational speedup. Additionally, we present a\nmethod to efficiently convert any angular mask to and from the popular HEALPix\nformat.

It allows a representation of a\ngeneral class of objects including geometric patterns and images in a sparse,\nmodular, hierarchical, and recursive manner. The representation can exploit any\ncomputable regularity in objects to compactly describe them, while also being\ncapable of representing random objects as raw data. A set of rules uniformly\ndictates the interpretation of the representation into raw signal, which makes\nit possible to ask what pattern a given raw signal contains. Also, it allows\nsimple separation of the information that we wish to ignore from that which we\nmeasure, by using a set of maps to delineate the a priori parts of the objects,\nleaving only the information in the structure.\n  Using the representation, we introduce a measure of information in general\nobjects relative to structures defined by the set of maps. We point out that\nthe common prescription of encoding objects by strings to use Kolmogorov\ncomplexity is meaningless when, as often is the case, the encoding is not\nspecified in any way other than that it exists. Noting this, we define the\nmeasure directly in terms of the structures of the spaces in which the objects\nreside. As a result, the measure is defined relative to a set of maps that\ncharacterize the structures. It turns out that the measure is equivalent to\nKolmogorov complexity when it is defined relative to the maps characterizing\nthe structure of natural numbers. Thus, the formulation gives the larger class\nof objects a meaningful measure of information that generalizes Kolmogorov\ncomplexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2007 18:41:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Jun 2008 03:37:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-12"}

However,\ngiven the uncertainty on the parameters of these systems, there exist\nconfigurations in which the effect of the hydrodynamic drag can be comparable\nto the radiation-reaction one in phases of the inspiral which are detectable by\nLISA. This is the case, for instance, for a 10^6 M_sun SMBH surrounded by a\ncorotating torus of comparable mass and with radius of 10^3-10^4 gravitational\nradii, or for a 10^5 M_sun SMBH surrounded by a corotating 10^4 M_sun torus\nwith radius of 10^5 gravitational radii. Should these conditions be met in\nastrophysical systems, EMRI-gravitational waves could provide a characteristic\nsignature of the presence of the torus. In fact, while radiation reaction\nalways increases the inclination of the orbit with respect to the equatorial\nplane, the hydrodynamic drag from a torus corotating with the SMBH always\ndecreases it.

The environment and\nits interaction with the qubits are modelled by random matrices. For two\nqubits, numerical studies reveal a simple one to one correspondence between its\ndecoherence and its internal entanglement decay. Using this relation we are\nable to give a formula for concurrence decay. For large environments the\nevolution induces a unital channel in the two qubits, providing a partial\nexplanation for the relation above. Using a kicked Ising spin network, we study\nthe exact evolution of two non-interacting qubits in the presence of a spin\nbath. We find that the entanglement (as measured by concurrence) of the two\nqubits has a close relation to the purity of the pair, and closely follows an\nanalytic relation derived for Werner states. As a collateral result we find\nthat an integrable environment causes quadratic decay of concurrence as well as\nof purity, while a chaotic environment causes linear decay. Both quantities\ndisplay recurrences in some integrable environments. Good agreement with the\nresults found using random matrix theory is obtained. Finally, we analyze\ndecoherence of a quantum register in the absence of non-local operations. The\nproblem is solved in terms of a sum rule which implies linear scaling in the\nnumber of qubits. Each term involves a single qubit and its entanglement with\nthe remaining ones. Two conditions are essential: decoherence must be small and\nthe coupling of different qubits must be uncorrelated in the interaction\npicture.

This flow\nhas constant vertical shear, is infinite in the vertical extent, and\ncharacterized by two density jumps of equal magnitude each decreasing\nsuccessively with height, in which the jumps are located symmetrically away\nfrom the midplane of the system. We find that for a suitably defined\nbulk-Richardson number there exists a band of horizontal wavenumbers which\nexhibits normal-mode instability. The instability mechanism closely parallels\nthe mechanism responsible for the instability seen in the problem of\ncounter-propagating Rossby waves. In this problem the instability arises out of\nthe interaction of counter-propagating gravity waves. We argue that the\ninstability meets the Hayashi-Young criterion for wave instability. We also\nargue that the instability is the simplest one that can arise in a stratified\natmosphere with constant shear flow. The counter propagating gravity waves\nmechanism detailed here explains why the Rayleigh criteria for shear flow\ninstability in the unstratified case does not need to be satisfied in the\nstratified case.

Furthermore, we devote a large part of\nthe paper to non-abelian anyons, motivating their existence from the point of\nview of trial wave functions, giving a simple exposition of their relation to\nconformal field theories, and reviewing several proposals for their direct\nobservation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2007 12:22:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The genus exhibits a great diversity of prey and pitcher forms\nand its mechanism of trapping has long intrigued scientists. The slippery inner\nsurfaces of the pitchers, which can be waxy or highly wettable, have so far\nbeen considered as the key trapping devices. However, the occurrence of species\nlacking such epidermal specializations but still effective at trapping insects\nsuggests the possible implication of other mechanisms. Methodology/Principal\nFindings : Using a combination of insect bioassays, high-speed video and\nrheological measurements, we show that the digestive fluid of Nepenthes\nrafflesiana is highly viscoelastic and that this physical property is crucial\nfor the retention of insects in its traps. Trapping efficiency is shown to\nremain strong even when the fluid is highly diluted by water, as long as the\nelastic relaxation time of the fluid is higher than the typical time scale of\ninsect movements. Conclusions/Significance : This finding challenges the common\nclassification of Nepenthes pitchers as simple passive traps and is of great\nadaptive significance for these tropical plants, which are often submitted to\nhigh rainfalls and variations in fluid concentration. The viscoelastic trap\nconstitutes a cryptic but potentially widespread adaptation of Nepenthes\nspecies and could be a homologous trait shared through common ancestry with the\nsundew (Drosera) flypaper plants. Such large production of a highly\nviscoelastic biopolymer fluid in permanent pools is nevertheless unique in the\nplant kingdom and suggests novel applications for pest control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2007 14:07:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Notably, this feature\nhas not spared molecular biology and its potential applications. Towards\ndeveloping more effective therapeutics against cancer, studies began to explore\nmore than a decade ago how natural tumor suppression could be translated into\nantineoplastic drugs. To this end, investigators focused on major constituents\nof a central pathway that protects cells against neoplastic transformation: the\nnuclear retinoblastoma protein (RB) pathway. As such, peptide mimetics of RB,\np16 and p21 were developed. Likewise, the p53 and von Hippel-Lindau gene\nproducts which affect indirectly the RB pathway provided additional templates\nfor the development of anti-proliferative peptides. Each of the peptides\nderived from these distinct tumor suppressors was made cell-permeable by its\nligation to an amino acid sequence conferring cellular internalization.

Sometimes it is possible to follow the\nmaterial motion starting from the prominence (filament) activation to the CME\nin the high corona. Remnants of the prominence were found in the bright core of\nCMEs. However, detailed comparisons of the two phenomena reveal problems in\nexplaining CMEs as a continuation of filament eruptions in the upper corona.\nFor example, the heliolatitudes of the disappeared filaments and subsequent\ncoronal ejections sometimes differ by tens of degrees. In order to clear up the\nproblems of EP-CME association we tentatively analyse the more general question\nof the dynamics of a magnetic flux rope. Prominences and filaments are the best\ntracers of the flux ropes in the corona long before the beginning of the\neruption. A twisted flux rope is held by the tension of field lines of\nphotospheric sources until parameters of the system reach critical values and a\ncatastrophe happens. We suggest that the associated flux rope height above the\nphotosphere is one of these parameters and it is revealed by the height of the\nfilament. 80 filaments were analysed and we found that eruptive prominences\nwere near the so-called limit of stability a few days before their eruptions.\nWe suggest that a comparison of the real heights of prominences with the\ncalculated critical heights from magnetograms could be systematically used to\npredict filament eruptions and the corresponding CMEs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2007 15:44:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
