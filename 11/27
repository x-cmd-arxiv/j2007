This has been suggested as a possible way to build up the\nhigh-mass portion of the stellar mass function and as a mechanism leading to\nthe formation of one or two very massive stars (M > 150 Msun) through a\ncollisional runaway. I quickly review the standard theory of stellar\ncollisions, covering both the stellar dynamics of dense clusters and the\nhydrodynamics of encounters between stars. The conditions for collisions to\ntake place at a significant rate are relatively well understood for idealised\nspherical cluster models without initial mass segregation, devoid of gas and\ncomposed of main-sequence (MS) stars. In this simplified situation, 2-body\nrelaxation drives core collapse through mass segregation and a collisional\nphase ensues if the core collapse time is shorter than the MS lifetime of the\nmost massive stars initially present. The outcome of this phase is still highly\nuncertain. A more realistic situation is that of a cluster still containing\nlarge amounts of interstellar gas from which stars are accreting. As stellar\nmasses increase, the central regions of the cluster contracts. This\nlittle-explored mechanism can potentially lead to very high stellar densities\nbut it is likely that, except for very rich systems, the contraction is halted\nby few-body interactions before collisions set in. A complete picture,\ncombining both scenarios, will need to address many uncertainties, including\nthe role of cluster sub-structure, the dynamical effect of interstellar gas,\nnon-MS stars and the structure and evolution of merged stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2007 17:37:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 2008 13:11:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-03-12"}

Serendipitous\nsearches of afterglows, especially at radio wavelengths, have long been the\nclassic alternative. These survey data have been interpreted assuming a\nuniformly emitting jet with sharp edges (``top-hat'' jet), in which case the\nratio of weakly relativistically beamed afterglows to GRBs scales with the jet\nsolid angle. In this paper, we consider, instead, a very wide outflow with a\nluminosity that decreases across the emitting surface. In particular, we adopt\nthe universal structured jet (USJ) model, that is an alternative to the top-hat\nmodel for the structure of the jet. However, the interpretation of the survey\ndata is very different: in the USJ model we only observe the emission within\nthe jet aperture and the observed ratio of prompt emission rate to afterglow\nrate should solely depend on selection effects. We compute the number and rate\nof afterglows expected in all-sky snapshot observations as a function of the\nsurvey sensitivity. We find that the current (negative) results for OA searches\nare in agreement with our expectations. In radio and X-ray bands this was\nmainly due to the low sensitivity of the surveys, while in the optical band the\nsky-coverage was not sufficient. In general we find that X-ray surveys are poor\ntools for OA searches, if the jet is structured. On the other hand, the FIRST\nradio survey and future instruments like the Allen Telescope Array (in the\nradio band) and especially GAIA, Pan-Starrs and LSST (in the optical band) will\nhave chances to detect afterglows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2007 20:23:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2007 21:34:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 27 Jul 2008 01:12:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We use it here to demonstrate that our observations\nhave probed the limit beyond which the cosmic curvature prevents any signal\nfrom having ever reached us. In the case of de Sitter, where the mass-energy\ndensity is a constant, this limit is fixed for all time.

The superburst occurred 55 days after the onset of an accretion\noutburst in 4U 1608-522. During that time interval, the accretion rate was at\nleast 7% of the Eddington limit. The peak flux of the superburst is 22 to 45%\nof the Eddington limit, and its radiation energy output is between 4e41 and\n9e41 erg for a distance of 3.2 kpc.

Among these measures, contact map overlap (CMO)\nmaximization deserved sustained attention during past decade because it offers\na fine estimation of the natural homology relation between proteins. Despite\nthis large involvement of the bioinformatics and computer science community,\nthe performance of known algorithms remains modest. Due to the complexity of\nthe problem, they got stuck on relatively small instances and are not\napplicable for large scale comparison. This paper offers a clear improvement\nover past methods in this respect. We present a new integer programming model\nfor CMO and propose an exact B &B algorithm with bounds computed by solving\nLagrangian relaxation. The efficiency of the approach is demonstrated on a\npopular small benchmark (Skolnick set, 40 domains). On this set our algorithm\nsignificantly outperforms the best existing exact algorithms, and yet provides\nlower and upper bounds of better quality. Some hard CMO instances have been\nsolved for the first time and within reasonable time limits. From the values of\nthe running time and the relative gap (relative difference between upper and\nlower bounds), we obtained the right classification for this test. These\nencouraging result led us to design a harder benchmark to better assess the\nclassification capability of our approach. We constructed a large scale set of\n300 protein domains (a subset of ASTRAL database) that we have called Proteus\n300.

These variables can be assembled in a coframe field,\ni.e., a local set of four linearly independent 1-forms. In the ordinary\nformulation, the coframe gravity does not have any connection to a specific\ngeometry even being constructed from the geometrical meaningful objects. A\ngeometrization of the coframe gravity is an aim of this paper. We construct a\ncomplete class of the coframe connections which are linear in the first order\nderivatives of the coframe field on an $n$ dimensional manifolds with and\nwithout a metric. The subclasses of the torsion-free, metric-compatible and\nflat connections are derived. We also study the behavior of the geometrical\nstructures under local transformations of the coframe. The remarkable fact is\nan existence of a subclass of connections which are invariant when the\ninfinitesimal transformations satisfy the Maxwell-like system of equations. In\nthe framework of the coframe geometry construction, we propose a geometrical\naction for the coframe gravity. It is similar to the Einstein-Hilbert action of\nGR, but the scalar curvature is constructed from the general coframe\nconnection. We show that this geometric Lagrangian is equivalent to the coframe\nLagrangian up to a total derivative term. Moreover there is a family of coframe\nconnections which Lagrangian does not include the higher order terms at all. In\nthis case, the equivalence is complete.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2007 10:07:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-12"}

Interesting\nobjects for this study are found in strong gravitational lensing systems, where\nthe foreground galaxies generate multiple images.\n  Aims. The reddening law of lensing galaxies is investigated by studying the\ncolours of gravitationally-lensed quasars, and a handful of other quasars where\na foreground galaxy is detected.\n  Methods. We compare the observed colours of quasars reported in the\nliterature, with spectral templates reddened by different extinction laws and\ndust properties. The data consists of 21 quasar-galaxy systems, with a total of\n48 images. The galaxies, which are both early- and late-type, have redshifts in\nthe interval z=0.04-1.51.\n  Results. We measure a difference in rest-frame B-V between the quasar images\nwe study, and quasars without resolved foreground galaxies. This difference in\ncolour is indicative of significant dust extinction in the intervening galaxy.\nGood fits to standard extinction laws were found for 22 of the images,\ncorresponding to 13 different galaxies. Our fits imply a wide range of possible\nvalues for the total-to-selective extinction ratio, Rv. The distribution was\nfound to be broad with a weighted mode of Rv=2.4 and a FWHM of 2.7 (sigma =\n1.1). Thus the bulk of the galaxies for which good reddening fits could be\nderived, have dust properties compatible with the Milky Way value (Rv=3.1).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2007 14:38:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 May 2008 08:12:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Thermal convection in rotating 2D equatorial\nsimulations demonstrates this mechanism. The convergence of the vorticity into\nzonal flow structures as a function of radius depends on the shape of the\ndensity profile, with the prograde jet forming in the region of the disk where\nthe greatest number of density scale heights occurs. The number of stable jets\nthat form in the fluid increases with decreasing Ekman number and decreases\nwith increasing thermal driving. This local form of vorticity generation via\nthe density stratification is likely to be of great importance in bodies that\nare quickly rotating, highly turbulent, and have large density changes, such as\nJovian planets. However, it is likely to be of lesser importance in the\ninteriors of planets such as the Earth, which have smaller density\nstratifications and are less turbulent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2007 15:54:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
