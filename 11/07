Here G_s(k;mu) is the\nsingle-particle Green function of particles with spin index s at the chemical\npotential mu. For the cases where the two-body interaction potential is\nshort-range, and in particular for lattice models, we explicitly demonstrate\nthat this theorem is unconditionally valid, irrespective of the strength of the\nbare interaction potential. We arrive at this conclusion by amongst other\nthings demonstrating that the perturbation series expansion for self-energy in\nterms of skeleton diagrams, as encountered in the proof of the Luttinger-Ward\nidentity, is uniformly convergent for almost all momenta and energies.

The\nextinction curve is consistent with the mean curve of other AGNs found by\nGaskell & Benker, but inconsistent with an SMC-type reddening curve. Because\nmost IR emission originates exterior to the broad-line region (BLR), the SED\nseen by the inner BLR is different from that seen by the outer BLR and from the\nearth. The most likely BLR covering factor is ~ 40% and it is not possible to\nget an overall BLR covering factor of less than 20%. This requires that the BLR\nis not spherically symmetric and that we are viewing through a hole.\nLine-continuum variability transfer functions are consistent with this\ngeometry. The covering factor and geometry imply that near the equatorial plane\nthe BLR covering approaches 100%. The spectrum seen by the outer regions of the\nBLR and by the torus is thus modified by the absorption in the inner BLR. This\nshielding solves the problem of observed BLR ionization stratification being\nmuch greater than implied by photoionization models. The BLR obscuration also\nremoves the problem of the torus covering factor being greater than the BLR\ncovering factor, and gives consistency with the observed fraction of obscured\nAGNs. The flux reduction at the torus also reduces the problem of AGN\ndust-reverberation lags giving sizes smaller than the dust-sublimation radii.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2007 07:46:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-11-08"}

The use of\nphenomenological amplitudes in the collision terms, which are constructed to\nreproduce experimental data, greatly helps to extend the validity region in the\nT-mu plane. The total viscosity coefficient eta(T,mu)=eta^pi + eta^N increases\nas a function of T and mu, indirectly reflecting energy dependences of binary\ncross sections. The increase in mu direction is due to enhancement of the\nnucleon contribution eta^N while the pion contribution eta^pi diminishes with\nincreasing mu.

One of the most used filters is the so-called\nbackwards difference filter that can be applied when the time series are\nregularly sampled.

As a consequence, spin-flip\nscattering may under certain conditions actually enhance the local density of\nstates due to the oscillatory behaviour of the latter in\nferromagnet/superconductor structures. We also conjecture that the damping\ncould be manifested in the behaviour of the critical temperature ($T_c$) of the\ns-wave superconductor in contact with the ferromagnet. More specifically, we\nargue that the non-monotonic decrease of $T_c$ in ferromagnet/s-wave\nsuperconductor junctions without magnetic impurities is altered to a monotonic,\nnon-oscillatory decrease when the condition $1>16\\tau_\\text{sf}^2h^2$ is\nfulfilled, where $\\tau_\\text{sf}$ is the spin-flip relaxation time and $h$ is\nthe exchange field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2007 10:36:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

This survey covers 1.53 deg^2 to\n5-sigma detection limits of K_vega = 20.5-21 and J_vega = 22.5, and overlaps\nwith the DEEP2 spectroscopic redshift survey. We discuss the details of this\nNIR survey, including our J and K band counts. We show that the K-band galaxy\npopulation has a redshift distribution that varies with K-magnitude, with most\nK < 17 galaxies at z < 1.5 and a significant fraction (38.3+/-0.3%) of K > 19\nsystems at z > 1.5. We further investigate the stellar masses and morphological\nproperties of K-selected galaxies, particularly extremely red objects, as\ndefined by (R-K) > 5.3 and (I-K) > 4. One of our conclusions is that the ERO\nselection is a good method for picking out galaxies at z > 1.2, and within our\nmagnitude limits, the most massive galaxies at these redshifts. The ERO limit\nfinds 75% of all M_* > 10^{11} M_0 galaxies at z ~ 1.5 down to K_vega = 19.7.\nWe further find that the morphological break-down of K < 19.7 EROs is dominated\nby early-types (57+/-3%) and peculiars (34+/-3%). However, about a fourth of\nthe early-types are distorted ellipticals, and within CAS parameter space these\nbridge the early-type and peculiar population, suggesting a morphological\nevolutionary sequence. We also investigate the use of a (I-K) > 4 selection to\nlocate EROs, finding that it selects galaxies at slightly higher average\nredshifts (<z> = 1.43+/-0.32) than the (R-K) > 5.3 limit with <z> =\n1.28+/-0.23. Finally, by using the redshift distribution of K < 20 selected\ngalaxies, and the properties of our EROs, we are able to rule out all\nmonolithic collapse models for the formation of massive galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2007 13:21:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

It\nrequires no assumptions about the symmetry or stationarity of the halo\nformation process. In this paper we study general static potentials which\nexhibit more complex behaviour than the separable potentials studied\npreviously. For ellipsoidal logarithmic potentials with a core, phase mixing is\nsensitive to the resonance structure, as indicated by the number of independent\norbital frequencies. Regions of chaotic mixing can be identified by the very\nrapid decrease in the real space density of the associated dark matter streams.\nWe also study the evolution of stream density in ellipsoidal NFW halos with\nradially varying isopotential shape, showing that if such a model is applied to\nthe Galactic halo, at least $10^5$ streams are expected near the Sun. The most\nnovel aspect of our approach is that general non-static systems can be studied\nthrough implementation in a cosmological N-body code. Such an implementation\nallows a robust and accurate evaluation of the enhancements in annihilation\nradiation due to fine-scale structure such as caustics. We embed the scheme in\nthe current state-of-the-art code GADGET-3 and present tests which demonstrate\nthat N-body discreteness effects can be kept under control in realistic\nconfigurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2007 15:40:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Ageing can\nbe characterised in terms of the linear response R(t,s) at time t to a local\nperturbation at time s<t. Usually one distinguishes two dynamical regimes,\nnamely, the quasi-stationary regime, where the response is translationally\ninvariant in time, and the ageing regime, where this invariance is broken. In\ngeneral these two regimes are separate in the sense that the two limits of (a)\ntaking t,s to infinity while keeping t/s fixed, and (b) taking t,s to infinity\nwith fixed t-s, give different results. In recent years, ageing was also\ninvestigated in the context of homogeneous critical systems such as the\nGlauber-Ising model and the contact process. Here we argue that, in contrast to\na widespread believe, homogeneous critical systems do not have a separate\nquasi-stationary regime, hence the two limits do commute. Moreover, it is\ndiscussed under which conditions two particular exponents, denoted as a and a'\nin the literature, have to be identical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2007 15:43:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-11-08"}
