The first explanation, known as the\nmany-worlds interpretation, does not require any modification of quantum\nmechanics, and asserts that at the time of measurement the Universe splits into\nmany branches, one branch for every possible alternative. The various branches\ndo not interfere with each other because of decoherence, thus providing a\npicture broadly consistent with the observed Universe. The second explanation,\nwhich requires quantum mechanics to be modified from its presently known form,\nis that at the time of measurement the wave-function collapses into one of the\npossible alternatives. The two explanations are mutually exclusive, and up\nuntil now, no theoretical reasoning has been put forward to choose one\nexplanation over the other. In this article, we provide an argument which\nimplies that the collapse interpretation is favored over the many-worlds\ninterpretation. Our starting point is the assertion (which we justify) that\nthere ought to exist a reformulation of quantum mechanics which does not refer\nto a classical spacetime manifold. The need for such a reformulation implies\nthat quantum theory becomes non-linear on the Planck mass/energy scale.\nStandard linear quantum mechanics is an approximation to this non-linear\ntheory, valid at energy scales much smaller than the Planck scale. Using ideas\nbased on noncommutative differential geometry, we develop such a reformulation\nand derive a non-linear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation, which can explain collapse of\nthe wave-function.

Carbon is one of the most abundant metals in the Universe but\nanalyses in early-type stars show inconclusive results, like large\ndiscrepancies between analyses of different lines in C II, a failure to\nestablish the C II/III ionization balance and the derivation of systematically\nlower abundances than from other objects. We present a comprehensive and robust\nC II/III/IV model for non-LTE line-formation calculations based on carefully\nselected atomic data. The model is calibrated with high-S/N spectra of six\napparently slow-rotating early B-type dwarfs and giants, which cover a wide\nparameter range and are randomly distributed in the solar neighbourhood. A\nself-consistent quantitative spectrum analysis is performed using an extensive\niteration scheme to determine stellar atmospheric parameters and to select the\nappropriate atomic data used for the derivation of chemical abundances. We\nestablish the carbon ionization balance for all sample stars based on a unique\nset of input atomic data, achieving consistency for all modelled lines. Highly\naccurate atmospheric parameters and a homogeneous carbon abundance with reduced\nsystematic errors are derived. This results in a present-day stellar carbon\nabundance in the solar neighbourhood, which is in good agreement with recent\ndeterminations of the solar value and with the gas-phase abundance of the Orion\nH II region. The homogeneous present-day carbon abundance also conforms with\npredictions of chemical-evolution models for the Galaxy.

Second, this potential\nconfiguration is quasi-statically sheared by photospheric vortex motions\napplied to two flux concentrations of the AR.

How protein concentration fluctuations affect the\ngrowth rate of a population of cells, is, however, a wide open question. We\npresent a mathematical model that makes it possible to quantify the effect of\nprotein concentration fluctuations on the growth rate of a population of\ngenetically identical cells. The model predicts that the population's growth\nrate depends on how the growth rate of a single cell varies with protein\nconcentration, the variance of the protein concentration fluctuations, and the\ncorrelation time of these fluctuations. The model also predicts that when the\naverage concentration of a protein is close to the value that maximizes the\ngrowth rate, fluctuations in its concentration always reduce the growth rate.\nHowever, when the average protein concentration deviates sufficiently from the\noptimal level, fluctuations can enhance the growth rate of the population, even\nwhen the growth rate of a cell depends linearly on the protein concentration.\nThe model also shows that the ensemble or population average of a quantity,\nsuch as the average protein expression level or its variance, is in general not\nequal to its time average as obtained from tracing a single cell and its\ndescendants. We apply our model to perform a cost-benefit analysis of gene\nregulatory control. Our analysis predicts that the optimal expression level of\na gene regulatory protein is determined by the trade-off between the cost of\nsynthesizing the regulatory protein and the benefit of minimizing the\nfluctuations in the expression of its target gene.

Our aim is to estimate the fundamental\natmospheric parameters and determine the chemical composition of these stars.\nDetailed analyses of single stars have previously suggested links to Am and\nlambda Bootis stars, so we wish to explore this interesting connection between\nchemical peculiarity and pulsation.

We obtained good\nresults in agreement with previously derived fundamental parameters and\nabundances in a few selected reference stars with properties similar to the\ngamma Dor stars.

The analytic signal is first\nlocally represented as a modulated oscillation, demodulated by its own\ninstantaneous frequency, and then Taylor-expanded at each point in time. The\nterms in this expansion, called the instantaneous modulation functions, are\ntime-varying functions which quantify, at increasingly higher orders, the local\ndepartures of the signal from a uniform sinusoidal oscillation. Closed-form\nexpressions for these functions are found in terms of Bell polynomials and\nderivatives of the signal's instantaneous frequency and bandwidth. The analytic\nwavelet transform is shown to depend upon the interaction between the signal's\ninstantaneous modulation functions and frequency-domain derivatives of the\nwavelet, inducing a hierarchy of departures of the transform away from a\nperfect representation of the signal. The form of these deviation terms\nsuggests a set of conditions for matching the wavelet properties to suit the\nvariability of the signal, in which case our expressions simplify considerably.\nOne may then quantify the time-varying bias associated with signal estimation\nvia wavelet ridge analysis, and choose wavelets to minimize this bias.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Nov 2007 12:32:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2009 13:17:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 15 Oct 2011 16:33:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-18"}
