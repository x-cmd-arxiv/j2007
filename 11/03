Recently several\ngroups have reported an enhanced cosmic-ray ionization rate in diffuse clouds\ncompared to the standard value, zeta(average)=2.5e-17 s^-1, measured toward\ndense molecular clouds. In an earlier work we reported an enhancement in the\ncosmic ray rate of 20 towards HD185418.

We show that the value of zeta deduced from the H$_{3}^+$\ncolumn density in the diffuse region of the sightline depends strongly on the\nproperties of the grains because they remove free electrons and change the\nhydrogen chemistry. The observations are largely consistent with a cosmic ray\nenhancement of 40, with several diagnostics indicating higher values.

The\napproach is based on the thermodynamic identity associated the first and second\nlaw of thermodynamics. In the framework of the approach different internal\ndissipative channels of energy are taken in account in an explicit form,\nnamely, the thermal channel and channels of defect subsystems. The identity has\na perfect differential form what permits to introduce an extended\nnon-equilibrium state and use the good developed mathematical formalism of\nequilibrium and non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The evolution of\nnon-equilibrium variables of a physical system are described by a Landau-based\nequation set expressed through internal or different kinds of free energy\nconnected by means of the Legendre transforms. The accordance between the\ndifferent kinds of energy is possible owing to introduction of some trends into\nthe equation subset described the defect subsystems and having a nature of\nstructural viscosity. The possibilities of the approach are illustrated on the\nexample of quasibrittle solid damage and failure.

The star has a dipole field misaligned relative to the rotation\naxis by a small angle Theta. Simulations show that, depending on the accretion\nrate, a star may be in the stable or unstable regime of accretion. In the\nunstable regime, matter penetrates deep into the magnetosphere through several\nelongated \"tongues\" which deposit matter at random places on the surface of the\nstar, leading to stochastic light-curves. In the stable regime, matter accretes\nin ordered funnel streams and the light-curves are almost periodic. A star may\nswitch between these two regimes depending on the accretion rate and may thus\nshow alternate episodes of ordered pulsations and stochastic light-curves. In\nthe intermediate regime, both stochastic and ordered pulsations are observed.\nFor Theta > 30 degrees, the instability is suppressed and stable accretion\nthrough funnel streams dominates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Nov 2007 02:14:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2007 05:00:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-17"}

As an alternative, I propose a more complex equation of state, with\npressure being function of three variables: dark energy density, matter density\nand the size of the Universe. One consequence of the new equation is that, in\nthe late-time Universe, cosmological scale factor is linear function of time;\nwhile the standard cosmology predicts an exponential function.The new equation\nof state allows attributing a temperature to the physical vacuum, a temperature\nproportional to the acceleration of the expansion of the Universe. The vacuum\ntemperature decreases with the expansion of the Universe, approaching (but\nnever reaching) the absolute zero.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Nov 2007 09:40:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2007 00:25:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2009 15:20:01 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2009 18:45:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-04"}
