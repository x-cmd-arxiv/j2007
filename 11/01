We hunt down\n(identify) galaxies using near-infrared observations in the Perseus\nstar-forming region by combining structural information, colors, and number\ndensity estimates. Galaxies at moderate redshifts (z = 0.1 - 0.5) have colors\nsimilar to young stellar objects (YSOs) at both near- and mid-infrared (e.g.\nSpitzer) wavelengths, which limits our ability to identify YSOs from colors\nalone. Structural information from high-quality near-infrared observations\nallows us to better separate YSOs from galaxies, rejecting 2/5 of the YSO\ncandidates identified from Spitzer observations of our regions and potentially\nextending the YSO luminosity function below K of 15 magnitudes where galaxy\ncontamination dominates. Once they are identified we use galaxies as valuable\nextra signal for making extinction maps of molecular clouds. Our new iterative\nprocedure: the Galaxies Near Infrared Color Excess method Revisited (GNICER),\nuses the mean colors of galaxies as a function of magnitude to include them in\nextinction maps in an unbiased way. GNICER increases the number of background\nsources used to probe the structure of a cloud, decreasing the noise and\nincreasing the resolution of extinction maps made far from the galactic plane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2007 17:47:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

For systems with inertia, we reproduce the nonequilibrium steady\nstates reported in a recent lattice Boltzmann study. The domain coarsening that\nwould occur in zero shear is arrested by the applied shear flow, which restores\na finite domain size set by the inverse shear rate. For inertialess systems, in\ncontrast, we find no evidence of nonequilibrium steady states free of finite\nsize effects: coarsening persists indefinitely until the typical domain size\nattains the system size, as in zero shear. We present an analytical argument\nthat supports this observation, and that furthermore provides a possible\nexplanation for a hitherto puzzling property of the nonequilibrium steady\nstates with inertia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2007 17:45:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

It relies, however, on a knowledge of the single band\ncontribution from zero to infinite frequency. A number of experiments over the\npast five years have used this sum rule; their data has been interpreted in\nsupport of 'kinetic energy-driven superconductivity'. However, because of the\npresence of unwanted interband optical spectral weight, they necessarily have\nto truncate their sum at a finite frequency. This work examines theoretical\nmodels where the impact of this truncation can be examined first in the normal\nstate, and then in the superconducting state. The latter case is particularly\nimportant as previous considerations attributed the observed anomalous\ntemperature dependence as an artifact of a non-infinite cutoff frequency. We\nfind that this is in fact not the case, and that the sign of the corrections\nfrom the use of a non-infinite cutoff is such that the observed temperature\ndependence is even more anomalous when proper account is taken of the cutoff.\nOn the other hand, in these same models, we find that the strong observed\ntemperature dependence in the normal state can be attributed to the effect of a\nnon-infinite cutoff frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2007 19:54:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We use a combination of the effective-mass approximation and the quantum\ndefect method; our variational ansatz is particularly suited to cases where an\nexcited state of one of the donors (control) is partially delocalised over\nseveral different centres, forming an analogue of an extended molecular\norbital. Our method allows calculations of the \"on/off\" ratios of exchange\ninteractions in such cases. We compare exchange interactions when the control\nis in the \"on\" and \"off\" states, and find that both the magnitude and sign of\nthe exchange interactions may be changed. To rationalize the sign-change, we\ncarry out a simple Green's function perturbation-theory calculation. This\nsimple model qualitatively explains the sign change and illustrates its origins\nboth in ring-exchange processes and in the delocalization of the control\nelectron.

The research elucidates the ground state (zero temperature)\nelectronic phase diagram of an aluminum arsenide quantum wire which is an\nexample of an interacting one dimensional electron liquid. Using one\ndimensional field theoretic methods involving abelian bosonization and the\nrenormalization group we show the existence of a spin gapped quantum wire with\nelectronic ground states such as charge density wave and singlet\nsuperconductivity. The superconducting state arises due to the unique umklapp\ninteraction present in the aluminum arsenide quantum wire bandstructure\ndiscussed in this dissertation. It is characterized by Cooper pairs carrying a\nfinite pairing momentum. This is a realization of the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-\nOvchinnikov state which is known to lead to inhomogeneous superconductivity.\nThe dissertation also presents a theoretical analysis of the finite temperature\nsingle hole spectral function of the one dimensional electron liquid with\ngapless spin and charge modes (Luttinger liquid). The hole spectral function is\nmeasured in angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments. The results\npredict a kink in the effective electronic dispersion of the Luttinger liquid.\nA systematic study of the temperature and interaction dependence of the kink\nprovides an alternative way to detect spincharge separation in one dimensional\nsystems where the peak due to the spin part of the spectral function is\nsuppressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2007 03:45:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}
