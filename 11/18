Both the quenched and unquenched cases are examined in detail. We\npresent evidence of a localization transition in the low lying modes of the\n  Dirac operator around the same temperature as the chiral phase transition.\nThus both level statistics and eigenvectors of the QCD Dirac operator at the\nchiral phase transition have similar properties than those of a disordered\nconductor at the metal-insulator transition. This strongly suggests the\nphenomenon of Anderson localization (localization by destructive quantum\ninterference) is the leading physical mechanism in the restoration of the\nchiral symmetry. Finally we argue that our findings are not in principle\nrestricted to the ILM approximation and may also be found in lattice\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Nov 2007 15:07:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

A useful tool in the study of such system is the Self Consistent\nExpansion (SCE), which might be said to generate its own \"small parameter\" .The\nself consistent expansion (SCE) has the advantage that its structure is just\nthat of a regular expansion, the only difference is that the simple system\naround which the expansion is performed is adjustable.
