Improving the calibration of SNe Ia\nincreases their power as cosmological standard candles. We find tentative\nevidence for a correlation between the late-time lightcurve slope and the peak\nluminosity of SNe Ia in the B band; brighter SNe Ia seem to have shallower\nlightcurve slopes between 100 and 150 days from maximum light. Using a Markov\nChain Monte Carlo analysis in calibrating SNe Ia, we are able to simultaneously\ntake into consideration the effect of dust extinction, the luminosity and\nlightcurve width correlation (parametrized by \\Delta m_{15}), and the\nluminosity and late-time lightcurve slope correlation. For the available sample\nof 11 SNe Ia with well-measured late-time lightcurves, we find that correcting\nfor the correlation between luminosity and late-time lightcurve slope of the\nSNe Ia leads to an intrinsic dispersion of 0.12 mag in the Hubble diagram. Our\nresults have significant implications for future supernova surveys aimed to\nilluminate the nature of dark energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Nov 2007 21:31:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Jun 2008 16:26:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

We derive an expression for hitting time\nusing superoperators, and numerically evaluate it for the walk on the hypercube\nfor various coins and decoherence models. We show that, by contrast to\nclassical walks, quantum walks can have infinite hitting times for some initial\nstates. We seek criteria to determine if a given walk on a graph will have\ninfinite hitting times, and find a sufficient condition for their existence.\nThe phenomenon of infinite hitting times is in general a consequence of the\nsymmetry of the graph and its automorphism group.

Using\nthe irreducible representations of the automorphism group, we derive conditions\nsuch that quantum walks defined on this graph must have infinite hitting times\nfor some initial states.

These modes pertain to perfect circular symmetry of the cavity\nand the stress conditions. In this paper we study the shape stability of the\nexpanding circular cavity against perturbations, in both the unbounded and the\nbounded growth regimes (for the latter the unperturbed theory predicts no\ncatastrophic failure). Since the unperturbed reference state is time dependent,\nthe linear stability theory cannot be cast into standard time-independent\neigenvalue analysis. The main results of our study are: (i) sufficiently small\nperturbations are stable, (ii) larger perturbations within the formal linear\ndecomposition may lead to an instability; this dependence on the magnitude of\nthe perturbations in the linear analysis is a result of the non-stationarity of\nthe growth, (iii) the stability of the circular cavity is particularly\nsensitive to perturbations in the effective disorder temperature; in this\ncontext we highlight the role of the rate sensitivity of the limiting value of\nthis effective temperature. Finally we point to the importance of the form of\nthe stress-dependence of the rate of STZ transitions. The present analysis\nindicates the importance of nonlinear effects that were not taken into account\nyet. Even more importantly, the analysis suggests that details of the\nconstitutive relations appearing in the theory can be constrained by the modes\nof macroscopic failure in these amorphous systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2007 08:59:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Jun 2008 11:58:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In\nparticular, we show that the fractal dimensions of random polydisperse bearings\nsweep predominantly the low range of values in the spectrum of fractal\ndimensions observed along real faults, which strengthen the evidence that\npolydisperse bearings may explain the occurrence of seismic gaps in nature. In\naddition, the influence of different distributions for the offset is studied\nand we find that the uniform distribution is the best choice for reproducing\nthe size-distribution of fault gouges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2007 14:53:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2007 09:51:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-15"}

In\nthis paper, we present a new method to deal with such a problem in MCMC global\nfitting analysis. Assuming that a certain type of correlations between\ndifferent observables exists in a subsample of GRBs, for the parameters\ninvolved in the correlation relation, we treat them as free parameters and\ndetermine them simultaneously with cosmological parameters through MCMC\nanalysis on GRB data together with other observational data. Then the circular\nproblem is naturally eliminated in this procedure. We take the Ghirlanda\nrelation as an example while keeping in mind the debate about its physical\nvalidity. Together with SNe Ia, WMAP and SDSS data, we include 27 GRBs with the\nreported Ghirlanda relation in our study, and perform MCMC global fitting. We\nconsider the $\\Lambda$CDM model and dynamical dark energy models. In each case,\nin addition to the constraints on the relevant cosmological parameters, we\nobtain the best fit values as well as the distributions of the correlation\nparameters $A$ and $C$. We find that the observational data sets other than\nGRBs can affect $A$ and $C$ considerably through their degeneracies with the\ncosmological parameters. The results on $A$ and $C$ for different cosmological\nmodels are in well agreement within $1\\sigma$ range. The best fit value of $A$\nin all models being analyzed is $A\\sim 1.53$ with $\\sigma \\sim 0.08$. For $C$,\nwe have the best value in the range of $0.94-0.98$ with $\\sigma\\sim 0.1$. It is\nalso noted that the distributions of $A$ and $C$ are generally broader than the\npriors used in many studies in literature.
