In the dipole\nspin-down formalism, the 2-sigma upper limits on their period derivatives, <\n2E-16 for both pulsars, implies surface magnetic field strengths of B_s < 3E11\nG and spin periods at birth equal to their present periods to three significant\ndigits. Their X-ray luminosities exceed their respective spin-down\nluminosities, implying that their thermal spectra are derived from residual\ncooling and perhaps partly from accretion of supernova debris. For sufficiently\nweak magnetic fields an accretion disk can penetrate the light cylinder and\ninteract with the magnetosphere while resulting torques on the neutron star\nremain within the observed limits. We propose the following as the origin of\nradio-quiet CCOs: the magnetic field, derived from a turbulent dynamo, is\nweaker if the NS is formed spinning slowly, which enables it to accrete SN\ndebris. Accretion excludes neutron stars born with both B_s < 1E11 G and P >\n0.1 s from radio pulsar surveys, where such weak fields are not encountered\nexcept among very old (> 40 Myr) or recycled pulsars. We predict that these\nbirth properties are common, and may be attributes of the youngest detected\nneutron star, the CCO in Cassiopeia A, as well as an undetected infant neutron\nstar in the SN 1987A remnant. In view of the far-infrared light echo discovered\naround Cas A and attributed to an SGR-like outburst, it is especially important\nto determine via timing whether Cas A hosts a magnetar or not. If not a\nmagnetar, the Cas A NS may instead have undergone a one-time phase transition\n(corequake) that powered the light echo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Nov 2007 23:55:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}
