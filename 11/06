We deal with a possible thermal nonequilibrium of the translational\nenergy of the particles, neglecting their internal energy and the reactive\ncollisions. Given the strong disparity of mass between the electrons and heavy\nparticles, such as molecules, atoms, and ions, we conduct a dimensional\nanalysis of the Boltzmann equation. We then generalize the Chapman-Enskog\nmethod, emphasizing the role of a multiscale perturbation parameter on the\ncollisional operator, the streaming operator, and the collisional invariants of\nthe Boltzmann equation. The system is examined at successive orders of\napproximation, each of which corresponding to a physical time scale. The\nmulticomponent Navier-Stokes regime is reached for the heavy particles, which\nfollow a hyperbolic scaling, and is coupled to first order drift-diffusion\nequations for the electrons, which follow a parabolic scaling. The transport\ncoefficients exhibit an anisotropic behavior when the magnetic field is strong\nenough. We also give a complete description of the Kolesnikov effect, i.e., the\ncrossed contributions to the mass and energy transport fluxes coupling the\nelectrons and heavy particles. Finally, the first and second principles of\nthermodynamics are proved to be satisfied by deriving a total energy equation\nand an entropy equation. Moreover, the system of equations is shown to be\nconservative and the purely convective system hyperbolic, thus leading to a\nwell-defined structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2007 16:21:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-07"}

Such automated classification\nwill compare and assign new objects to a set of pre-defined variability\ntraining classes. For every variability class, a literature search was\nperformed to find as many well-known member stars as possible, or a\nconsiderable subset if too many were present. Next, we searched on-line and\nprivate databases for their light curves in the visible band and performed\nperiod analysis and harmonic fitting. The derived light curve parameters are\nused to describe the classes and define the training classifiers. We compared\nthe performance of different classifiers in terms of percentage of correct\nidentification, of confusion among classes and of computation time. We describe\nhow well the classes can be separated using the proposed set of parameters and\nhow future improvements can be made, based on new large databases such as the\nlight curves to be assembled by the CoRoT and Kepler space missions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2007 17:41:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

It is unusually large for a star cluster in M51 and we\ntherefore investigate the three most likely options to explain this object: (a)\na background galaxy, (b) a cluster in the disk of M51 and (c) a cluster in M51,\nbut in front of the disk. Methods: We use HST/ACS and HST/NICMOS broad-band\nphotometry to study the properties of this object. Assuming the object is a\nstar cluster, we fit the metallicity, age, mass and extinction using simple\nstellar population models. Assuming the object is a background galaxy, we\nestimate the extinction from the colour of the background around the object. We\nstudy the structural parameters of the object by fitting the spatial profile\nwith analytical models. Results: We find de-reddened colours of the object\nwhich are bluer than expected for a typical elliptical galaxy, and the central\nsurface brightness is brighter than the typical surface brightness of a disc\ngalaxy. It is therefore not likely that the object is a background galaxy.\nAssuming the object is a star cluster in the disc of M51, we estimate an age\nand mass of 0.7 Gyr and 2.2 x 10^5 \\msun, respectively (with the extinction\nfixed to E(B-V) = 0.2). Considering the large size of the object, we argue that\nin this scenario we observe the cluster just prior to final dissolution. If we\nfit for the extinction as a free parameter, a younger age is allowed and the\nobject is not close to final dissolution. Alternatively, the object could be a\nstar cluster in M51, but in front of the disc, with an age of 1.4 Gyr and mass\nM = 1.7 x 10^5 \\msun. Its effective radius is between ~12-25 pc. This makes the\nobject a \"fuzzy star cluster\", raising the issue of how an object of this age\nwould end up outside the disc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2007 19:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2007 10:35:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-12-17"}

This paper proposes a\nframework that appears sufficiently general to incorporate some expected\nfeatures of quantum gravity. These include the statement that space and time\nmay only emerge approximately and relationally. One perspective on such a\nframework is as a sort of generalization of the S-matrix approach to dynamics.\nWithin this framework, more dynamical structure is required to fully specify a\ntheory; this structure is expected to lack some of the elements of local\nquantum field theory. Some aspects of this structure are discussed, both in the\ncontext of scattering of perturbations about a flat background, and in the\ncontext of cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2007 21:31:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Sep 2008 20:07:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

A gravitational lensing\nestimate of the mass enclosed inside the Einstein circle can be obtained by\nmeasuring the Einstein angle, once the critical density of the system is known.\nA model-dependent dynamical estimate of this mass can also be obtained by\nmeasuring the central velocity dispersion of the stellar component. By assuming\nthe well-tested homologous 1/r^{2} profile for the total density distribution\nin the lens elliptical galaxies, these two mass measurements can be properly\ncompared. Thus, a relation between the Einstein angle and the central stellar\nvelocity dispersion is derived, and the cosmological matter and the dark-energy\ndensity parameters can be estimated from this.

The aim of this work is to generalize these results to the wreath\nproduct $S_n\\wr \\Z_m$, also known as the generalized symmetric group $G\\nm$. We\nfirst define a quasi-symmetrizing action of $G\\nm$ on $\\C[x_1,...,x_n]$, then\nobtain a description of the invariants and the codimension of the associated\nideal, which is $m^n C_n$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2007 15:46:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-11-07"}

The method have been extensively tested by investigating\nhydrogen and silicon dynamics in hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H). By\ncomparing the theoretical and experimental vibrational spectra we demonstrate\nhow to relate vibrational properties to the structural stability, bonding and\nhydrogen diffusion. We extracted microscopic characteristics that cannot be\nobtained by other techniques, namely hydrogen migration and related bond\nswitching, dangling bond passivation, low hydrogen activation energy, and\na-Si:H stability in general, and we show, via the analysis of a test case, that\nour method provides a rigorous and realistic description of non-crystalline\nmaterials. We also demonstrate that this method offers the possibility of\naccessing other important macroscopic characteristics of amorphous silicon and\ncan be used to model all the aspects of a-Si:H dynamics, including the\ndetrimental Staebler-Wronski effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2007 15:57:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Of the various interpretations of these phenomena, the\none best supported by the data is the following. Accreting compact objects,\nsuch as black holes, are seen to emit relativistic puffs of plasma:\n`cannonballs' (CBs). The inner domain of a rotating star whose core has\ncollapsed resembles such an accreting system. This suggests that core-collapse\nsupernovae (SNe) emit CBs, as SN1987A did. The fate of a CB as it exits a SN\nand travels in space can be studied as a function of the CB's mass and energy,\nand of `ambient' properties: the encountered matter- and light- distributions,\nthe composition of the former, and the location of intelligent observers. The\nlatter may conclude that the interactions of CBs with ambient matter and light\ngenerate CRs and GRBs, all of whose properties can be described by this `CB\nmodel' with few parameters and simple physics. GRB data are still being taken\nin unscrutinized domains of energy and timing. They agree accurately with the\nmodel's predictions. CR data are centenary. Their precision will improve, but\nnew striking predictions are unlikely. Yet, a one-free-parameter description of\nall CR data works very well.
