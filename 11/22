The superconducting barriers\nare assumed to be reflection-less so that an incident electron on the barrier\ncan either tunnel through it or Andreev reflect from it. In this structure,\nquantum charge pumping can be achieved (a) by modulating the amplitudes,\n$\\Delta_1$ and $\\Delta_2$ of the two superconducting gaps or alternatively, (b)\nby a periodic modulation of the order parameter phases, $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$\nof the superconducting barriers. In the former case, we show that the\nsuperconducting gap gives rise to a very sharp resonance in the transmission\nresulting in quantization of pumped charge, when the pumping contour encloses\nthe resonance. On the other hand, we find that quantization is hard to achieve\nin the latter case. We show that inclusion of weak electron-electron\ninteraction in the quantum wire leads to renormalisation group evolution of the\ntransmission amplitude towards the perfectly transmitting limit due to\nproximity effects. Hence as we approach the zero temperature limit, we get\ndestruction of quantized pumped charge. This is in sharp contrast to the case\nof charge pumping in a double barrier in a Luttinger liquid where quantized\ncharge pumping is actually achieved in the zero temperature limit. We also\npropose an experimental set-up to study these effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2007 20:20:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 Jul 2008 07:24:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 Aug 2008 20:55:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Results show that theoretical models underestimate\nthe radii and overestimate the effective temperatures of low-mass stars but\nyield luminosities that accord with observations. A hypothesis based upon the\neffects of stellar activity was put forward to explain the discrepancies. In\nthis paper we study the existence of the same trend in single active stars and\nprovide a consistent scenario to explain systematic differences between active\nand inactive stars in the H-R diagram reported earlier. The analysis is done\nusing single field stars of spectral types late-K and M and computing their\nbolometric magnitudes and temperatures through infrared colours and spectral\nindices. The properties of the stars in samples of active and inactive stars\nare compared statistically to reveal systematic differences.

Important Iso-EOS\neffects are stressed. Reactions induced by unstable 132Sn beams appear to be\nvery promising tools to test the sub-saturation Isovector EoS. New Isospin\nsensitive observables are also presented for deep-inelastic, fragmentation\ncollisions and Isospin equilibration measurements (Imbalance Ratios). The high\ndensity symmetry term can be derived from isospin effects on heavy ion\nreactions at relativistic energies (few AGeV range), that can even allow a\n``direct'' study of the covariant structure of the isovector interaction in the\nhadron medium. Rather sensitive observables are proposed from collective flows\nand from pion/kaon production. The possibility of the transition to a mixed\nhadron-quark phase, at high baryon and isospin density, is finally suggested.\nSome signatures could come from an expected ``neutron trapping'' effect. The\nimportance of studying violent collisions with radioactive beams from low to\nrelativistic energies is finally stressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Nov 2007 11:13:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-25"}
