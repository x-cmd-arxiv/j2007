All these absorption systems have metal lines, usually C IV or Mg II.\nWe see 17 cases of absorption in one line-of-sight within 200 km/s (1 Mpc) of\nabsorption in the paired line-of-sight with the probability at least approx 50%\nat 100kpc, declining rapidly to 23% at 100 - 200 kpc. We detect clustering on\n0.5Mpc scales and see a hint of the \"fingers of God\" redshift-space distortion.\nThe distribution matches absorbers arising in galaxies at z=2 with a normal\ncorrelation function and systematic infall velocities but unusually low random\npair-wise velocity differences. Absorption in gas flowing out from galaxies at\na mean velocity of 250 km/s would produce vastly more elongation than we see.\nThe UV absorption from fast winds that Adelberger et al. 2005 see in spectra of\nLBGs is not representative of the absorption that we see. Either the winds are\nconfined to LBGs, or they can not extend to 40 kpc with large velocities, while\ncontinuing to make UV absorption we see, implying most metals were in place in\nthe IGM long before z=2. Separately, when we examine the absorption seen when a\nsight line passes a second QSO, we see 19 absorbers within 400 km/s of the\npartner QSO. The probability of seeing absorption is approximately constant for\nimpact parameters 0.1 - 1.5 Mpc. Perhaps we do not see a rapid rise in the\nprobability at small impact parameters because the UV from QSOs destroys some\nabsorbers near to the QSOs. The 3D distribution of 64 absorbers around 313 QSOs\nis to first order isotropic, with just a hint of the anisotropy expected if the\nQSO UV emission is beamed, or alternatively QSOs might emit UV isotropically\nbut for a surprisingly short time of only 0.3Myr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2007 20:58:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Nov 2007 01:21:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

We show that the\nscattered Lya radiation obtains a high level of polarization for a wide range\nof likely environments of high-redshift galaxies. For example, the\nback-scattered Lya flux observed from galaxies surrounded by a superwind-driven\noutflow may reach a fractional polarization as high as ~40%.

Because of the geometrical extention of\nthe solar photosphere and the increased path lengths of tangential rays the Sun\nappears to be larger to an observer who measures the extent of the solar disk.\nBased on radiative transfer calculations we show that this discrepancy can be\nexplained by the difference between the height at disk center where\n$\\tau_{\\mathrm{5000}}=1$ ($\\tau_{\\mathrm{Ross}}=2/3$) and the inflection point\nof the intensity profile on the limb.

On the one\nhand, the molecular emission of the dust lanes is extracted from the observed\nCO l-b-V distribution according to the interpretation of a dynamical model. On\nthe other hand, a three dimensional extinction map of the Galactic central\nregion constructed from near-infrared observations is used as a tracer of the\ndust itself and clearly reveals dust lanes in its face-on projection.\nComparison of the position of both independent detections of the dust lanes is\nperformed in the (l, b) plane. These two completely independent methods are\nused to provide a coherent picture of the dust lanes in the Milky Way bar.

Due to the decrease in velocity caused by the\nshock, this occurs at lower z. The second assumes that the gas and dust remain\non a common tilted plane, but that the molecular gas decouples from the Milky\nWay's magnetic field, itself strong enough to resist the shear of the bar's\nshock.

The\nleading medium-enhanced higher twist corrections which describe the multiple\nscattering of the jet in the nucleus are re-summed to all orders of twist. The\npropagation of the jet in the absence of further radiative energy loss is shown\nto be governed by a transverse momentum diffusion equation. We compute the\nfinal photon spectrum in the limit of soft photons, taking into account the\nleading and next-to-leading terms in the photon momentum fraction y. In this\nlimit, the photon spectrum in a physical gauge is shown to arise from two\ninterfering sources: one where the initial hard scattering produces an\noff-shell quark which immediately radiates the photon and then undergoes\nsubsequent soft re-scattering; alternatively the quark is produced on-shell and\npropagates through the medium until it is driven off-shell by re-scattering and\nradiates the photon. Our result has a simple formal structure as a product of\nthe photon splitting function, the quark transverse momentum distribution\ncoming from a diffusion equation and a dimensionless factor which encodes the\neffect of the interferences encountered by the propagating quark over the\nlength of the medium. The destructive nature of such interferences in the small\ny limit are responsible for the origin of the Landau-Pomeranchuck-Migdal (LPM)\neffect. Along the way we also discuss possible implications for quark jets in\nhot nuclear matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2007 18:14:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2008 16:54:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

This conceptual shift directs us toward the evolution of\ncompact populations containing only a handful of members.

Contagion is a convenient analytical\nformalism to characterize semantic themes underlying observed feature patterns,\nsuch as biological context. We present model variants tailored to different\nproperties of biological data, and we outline a general variational inference\nscheme for approximate posterior inference. We validate our methods on both\nsimulated data and realistic high-throughput gene expression profiles via SAGE.\nOur results show improved predictions of gene functions over existing methods\nbased on stronger independence assumptions, and demonstrate feasibility of a\npromising hierarchical Bayesian formalism for soft clustering and latent\naspects analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2007 21:36:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-11-19"}

Such a control\nscheme is often referred to in the quantum control literature as \"coherent\nfeedback control.'' It distinguishes the present work from previous works on\nthe quantum LQG problem where measurement is performed on the plant and the\nmeasurement signals are used as input to a fully classical controller with no\nquantum degrees of freedom. The difference in our formulation is the presence\nof additional non-linear and linear constraints on the coefficients of the\nsought after controller, rendering the problem as a type of constrained\ncontroller design problem. Due to the presence of these constraints our problem\nis inherently computationally hard and this also distinguishes it in an\nimportant way from the standard LQG problem. We propose a numerical procedure\nfor solving this problem based on an alternating projections algorithm and, as\ninitial demonstration of the feasibility of this approach, we provide fully\nquantum controller design examples in which numerical solutions to the problem\nwere successfully obtained.

We consider a particular state, known to be 1-copy nondistillable,\nwhich is supposed to be bound entangled. We study the problem of its two-copy\ndistillability, which boils down to show that maximal overlap of some projector\nQ with Schmidt rank two states does not exceed 1/2. Such property we call the\nthe half-property. We first show that the maximum overlap can be attained on\nvectors that are not of the simple product form with respect to cut between two\ncopies.

We have succeeded to prove the\nhalf-property for wide classes of states, and to bound the overlap from above\nby c<3/4.

We present the comparable-mass version of a new, resummed\n3PN-accurate EOB quadrupolar waveform recently introduced in the\nsmall-mass-ratio limit. We compare the phase and the amplitude of this waveform\nto the recently published results of a high-accuracy numerical relativity (NR)\nsimulation of 15 orbits of an inspiralling equal-mass binary BHs system\nperformed by the Caltech-Cornell group. We find a remarkable agreement, both in\nphase and in amplitude, between the new EOB waveform and the published\nnumerical data. More precisely: (i) in the gravitational wave (GW) frequency\ndomain $M\\omega <0.08$ where the phase of one of the non-resummed ``Taylor\napproximant'' (T4) waveform matches well with the numerical relativity one, we\nfind that the EOB phase fares as well, while (ii) for higher GW frequencies,\n$0.08<M\\omega\\lesssim 0.14$, where the TaylorT4 approximant starts to\nsignificantly diverge from the NR phase, we show that the EOB phase continues\nto match well the NR one. We further propose various methods of tuning the two\ninspiral flexibility parameters, $a_5$ and $v_{\\rm pole}$, of the EOB waveform\nso as to ``best fit'' EOB predictions to numerical data. We find that the\nmaximal dephasing between EOB and NR can then be reduced below $10^{-3}$ GW\ncycles over the entire span (30 GW cycles) of the simulation. Our resummed EOB\namplitude agrees much better with the NR one than any of the previously\nconsidered non-resummed, post-Newtonian one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Nov 2007 15:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2007 16:24:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The two methods yield consistent statistical correction factors. A\nsearch of the NED has yielded optical identifications for 89% of sources in the\ncomplete sub-sample of 252 sources with S/N>5 and S>1.1 Jy at 23 GHz; 5 sources\nturned out to be Galactic and were removed. The NED also yielded redshifts for\n92% of the extragalactic sources at |b|>10deg. Their distribution was compared\nwith model predictions; the agreement is generally good but a possible\ndiscrepancy is noted. Using the 5 GHz fluxes from the GB6 or PMN surveys, we\nfind that 76% of the 191 extragalactic sources with S_23GHz>1.3,Jy can be\nclassified as flat-spectrum sources between 5 and 23 GHz. A spectral steepening\nis observed at higher frequencies: only 59% of our sources are still\nflat-spectrum sources between 23 and 61 GHz and the average spectral indexes\nsteepen from <alpha_5^23>= 0.01\\pm 0.03 to <alpha_41^61>= 0.37\\pm 0.03.

The\nsource number counts have a close to Euclidean slope and are in good agreement\nwith the predictions of the cosmological evolution model by De Zotti et al.\n(2005).

In this picture, the energy of the radiating particles is\ndetermined by heating and cooling balance (slow heating model). Detailed\nradiative transfer calculations show that, at Thomson optical depths of order\nof unity, the dominant radiative process is inverse Compton scattering.\nSynchrotron-self-absorbed emission and inverse Compton dominate in the Thomson\nthin parts of the flow. The electrons stay thermal throughout the dissipation\nregion because of Coulomb collisions (Thomson thick part of the flow) and\nexchange of synchrotron photons (Thomson thin part). The resulting spectrum\nnaturally explains the observed sub-MeV break of the GRB emission and the\nspectral slopes above and below the break. The model predicts that the\ngamma-ray power-law tail has a high-energy cutoff typically in the ~0.1-1 GeV\nenergy range that should be observable with {\\it GLAST}.
