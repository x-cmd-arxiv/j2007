Observations made on days 20.8 and 26.8 of the outburst show a\nsynchrotron-emitting partial shell that is much brighter to the east than to\nthe west. Assuming the broad component of the infrared lines corresponds to the\noutermost part of the shell seen by the VLBA, the distance to the source is\n$2.45\\pm0.4 kpc$. The circular shape and spectral indices of the shell emission\nchallenge simple models for the radio structure immediately after the outburst.\nThe second epoch also shows an additional, resolved, synchrotron-emitting\ncomponent well to the east of the shell. Its inferred velocity is comparable to\nthe escape speed from the surface of a high-mass white dwarf. This component\nwas not seen in the first epoch. Its appearance may be related to the outflow\nreaching the edge of the nebula created by the red giant wind, which had been\nre-filling the void left by the last outburst in 1985. This eastern component\nis likely related to the jets previously seen in this and other symbiotic\nstars, and represents the earliest clear detection of such a jet, as well as\nthe best case yet for synchrotron emission from a white dwarf jet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2007 19:26:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

At redshifts above 6, when the universe was less than 1\nGyr old, dust could have only condensed in the explosive ejecta of Type II\nsupernovae (SNe), since most of the progenitors of the AGB stars, the major\nalternative source of interstellar dust, did not have time to evolve off the\nmain sequence.

It implies that if the product of two\nsufficiently large graphs has bounded Hadwiger number then it is one of the\nfollowing graphs:\n  - a planar grid with a vortex of bounded width in the outerface,\n  - a cylindrical grid with a vortex of bounded width in each of the two `big'\nfaces, or\n  - a toroidal grid.\n  Motivation for studying the Hadwiger number of a graph includes Hadwiger's\nConjecture, which states that the chromatic number chi(G) <= h(G). It is open\nwhether Hadwiger's Conjecture holds for every Cartesian product. We prove that\nif |V(H)|-1 >= chi(G) >= chi(H) then Hadwiger's Conjecture holds for G*H. On\nthe other hand, we prove that Hadwiger's Conjecture holds for all Cartesian\nproducts if and only if it holds for all G * K_2.

The linear\nconstraints, like mass conservation constraint, reversibility constraint,\nbiological capacity constraint, can be imposed on linear algorithms. However,\nrecently a non-linear constraint based on the second thermodynamic law, known\nas \"loop law\", has emerged and challenged the existing algorithms. Proven to be\nunfeasible with linear solutions, this non-linear constraint has been\nsuccessfully imposed on the sampling process. In this place, Monte - Carlo\nsampling with Metropolis criterion and Simulated Annealing has been introduced\nto optimize the Biomass synthesis of genome scale metabolic network of\nHelicobacter pylori (iIT341 GSM / GPR) under mass conservation constraint,\nbiological capacity constraint, and thermodynamic constraints including\nreversibility and \"loop law\". The sampling method has also been employed to\noptimize a non-linear objective function, the Biomass synthetic rate, which is\nunified by the total income number of reducible electrons. To verify whether a\nsample contains internal loops, an automatic solution has been developed based\non solving a set of inequalities. In addition, a new type of pathway has been\nproposed here, the Futile Pathway, which has three properties: 1) its mass flow\ncould be self-balanced; 2) it has exchange reactions; 3) it is independent to\nthe biomass synthesis. To eliminate the fluxes of the Futile Pathways in the\nsampling results, a linear programming based method has been suggested and the\nresults have showed improved correlations among the reaction fluxes in the\npathways related to Biomass synthesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2007 03:22:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2007 16:04:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2007 09:53:20 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2007 16:30:51 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 22 Apr 2008 13:34:15 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sun, 29 Nov 2009 01:29:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-29"}

A major challenge is to understand the\nlateral heterogeneous structures in membranes and membrane fluidity in the\npresence of inclusions. Based on a considerable amount of experimental evidence\nfor lateral organization of lipid membranes which share astonishingly similar\nfeatures in the presence of different inclusions, we first present a general\nmodel system of bilayer membranes embedded by nanosized inclusions, and explain\nexperimental findings. Here, the hydrophobic inclusions are simple models of\nintrinsic membrane proteins, cholesterol embedded in the membrane, hydrophobic\ndrugs, or other nanoparticles for bio-medical applications. It is found that\nlipid/inclusion-rich raft domains are formed at moderate inclusion\nconcentrations, and disappear with the increase of inclusions. At high\ninclusion content, chaining of inclusions occurs due to the effective\nattraction between inclusions mediated by lipids. Meanwhile, increasing\ninclusions can also cause thickening of the membrane, and the distribution of\ninclusions undergoes a layering transition from one-layer located in the\nbilayer midplane to two-layer structure arranged into the two leaflets of a\nbilayer. Our theoretical predictions address the complex interactions between\nmembranes and inclusions, suggesting a unifying mechanism which reflects the\ncompetition between the conformational entropy of lipids favoring the formation\nof lipid-rich rafts and the steric repulsion of inclusions leading to the\nuniform dispersion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2007 08:55:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-11-09"}

Non-resonant x-ray magnetic scattering (NRXMS) revealed a dominant\n$A$-type domain.

XRS experiments were performed in the\nvicinity of the Mn $K$ and Tb $L_3$ edges in the high-temperature collinear\nphase, the intermediate temperature cycloidal/ferroelectric phase, and the\nlow-temperature phase. In the collinear phase resonant $E1-E1$ satellites were\nfound at the Mn $K$ edge associated with $A$-type but also $F$-type peaks. The\nazimuthal dependence of the $F$-type satellites (and their absence in the NRXMS\nexperiments) indicates that they are most likely non-magnetic in origin. We\nsuggest instead that they may be associated with an induced charge multipole.\nAt the Tb $L_3$ edge resonant $A$- and $F$-type satellites ($E1-E1$) were\nobserved in the collinear phase.

This includes\nDerrida's Random Energy Model (REM) and Generalized Random Energy Model (GREM)\nand a nonhierarchical version (BK-GREM) by Bolthausen and Kistler. The limiting\nfree energy in all these models along with Word GREM, a model proposed by us,\nturn out to be a cute consequence of large deviation principle (LDP). This LDP\nargument allows us to consider non-Gaussian driving distributions as well as\nexternal field. We could also consider random trees as the underlying tree\nstructure in GREM. In all these models, as expected, limiting free energy is\nnot 'universal' unlike the SK model. However it is 'rate specific'.\nConsideration of non-Gaussian driving distribution as well as different driving\ndistributions for the different levels of the underlying trees in GREM leads to\ninteresting phenomena. For example in REM, if the Hamiltonian is Binomial with\nparameter $N$ and $p$ then the existence of phase transition depends on the\nparameter $p$. More precisely, phase transition takes place only when\n$p>{1/2}$.

It is based on gradual frequency shifts of the components observed\nbetween states, and uses a previous identification in the black hole low hard\nstate as a starting point. It is supported by correlations between the\nfrequencies in agreement with those previously found to hold for black hole and\nneutron stars. Similar variability components are observed in neutron stars and\nblack holes (only the component observed at the highest frequencies is\ndifferent) which therefore cannot depend on source-specific characteristics\nsuch as the magnetic field or surface of the neutron star or spin of the black\nhole. As the same variability components are also observed across the jet-line\nthe X-ray variability cannot originate from the outer-jet but is most likely\nproduced in either the disk or the corona. We use the identification to\ndirectly compare the difference in strength of the black hole and neutron star\nvariability and find these can be attributed to differences in frequency and\nstrength of high frequency features, and do not require the absence of any\ncomponents.

The corresponding supergravity solutions are found using\nequations for type IIB flows with N=1 supersymmetry obtained in [2]. We find\nthat magnetic couplings of the axion to D7-branes filling 4-d spacetime and\nwrapping 4-cycles at locations of duality transitions and invisible Dirac\n8-branes whose worldvolume emanates from the worldvolume of the D7-branes are\nthe sources for the runnings of the dilaton and the axion. Our construction\nprovides the first explicit example of a gauge/gravity duality mapping with a\nrunning dilaton or a running axion which is an important component towards\nfinding gravity duals to gauge theories with physically more interesting\nrenormalization group flows such as pure confining gauge theories in four\ndimensions. The D7-branes also serve as gravitational source for Seiberg\nduality transitions. The supergravity background has distinct features which\ncould be useful for constructing cosmological models and studying possibilities\nfor probing stringy signatures from the early universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2007 15:51:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2007 20:13:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 27 Dec 2007 20:16:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-12-27"}

In this spinel system only the A-site Co^2+ cation is\nmagnetic, while the non-magnetic B-site Al^3+ is substituted by the low-spin\nnon-magnetic Co^3+, and it is possible to investigate the complete phase\ndiagram from Co^2+Al^3+_2O_4 to Co^2+Co^3+_2O_4. All samples reveal large\nnegative Curie-Weiss temperatures Theta_CW of the order of -110 K independent\nof concentration, which is attributed to a high multiplicity of the\nsuperexchange interactions between the A-site Co^2+ cations. A pure\nantiferromagnetic state is found for x = 1.0 and 0.9 with Neel temperatures T_N\n= 29.5 K and 21.2 K, respectively, as evidenced by lambda-like anomalies in the\nspecific heat. Compositions with 0.3<x<0.75 show smeared out strongly reduced\nmagnetic ordering temperatures. At low temperatures, a T^2.5 dependence of the\nspecific heat is indicative of a spin-liquid state. For x < 0.2 a T^2\ndependence of the specific heat and a spin-glass like behavior of the\nsusceptibility below T_f = 4.7 K are observed. The high value of the\nfrustration parameter f = |Theta_CW|/T_f > 10 indicates the presence of strong\nspin frustration at least for x < 0.6. The frustration mechanism is attributed\nto competing nearest neighbor and next-nearest neighbor superexchange\ninteractions between the A-site Co^2+ ions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2007 15:48:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
