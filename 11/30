The analysis exhibits the\nexistence of Higgs Mass Patterns (HPs) (for $\\mu>0$) where the CP odd Higgs\ncould be the next heavier particle beyond the LSP and sometimes even lighter\nthan the LSP. It is shown that the Higgs production cross sections from the HPs\nare typically the largest enhancing the prospects for their detection at the\nLHC. Indeed it is seen that the recent Higgs production limits from CDF/D\\O\\\nare beginning to put constraints on the HPs. It is also seen that the $B_s\\to\n\\mu^+\\mu^-$ limits constrain the HPs more stringently. Predictions of the Higgs\nproduction cross sections for these patterns at the LHC are made.

Methods: We combine the results from the\ntime-averaged spectral analysis with model-independent information from X-ray\ntemporal and spectral variability analyses, and with additional broadband\ninformation (UV and radio). Results: The values of the Eddington ratios of our\nsample span 2 orders of magnitude. The 4 AGN are adequately fitted by the same\ncontinuum model that comprises at least one thermal component and a partially\nabsorbed power law, whose relative contribution and photon index vary\nsubstantially from source to source. NGC1692 and PKS0625-35 have fairly steep\npower-law components, perhaps indicative of synchrotron emission from a jet.\nConversely, the flat photon index derived for 3C88 may be indicative of a\nheavily absorbed object. Finally, the time-averaged spectral properties of\n3C444 (Gamma~1.9 and an apparent line-like excess around 6.7 keV) are more in\nline with Seyfert galaxies. The temporal analysis reveals that PKS0625-35 and\n3C88 are significantly variable in the soft energy band. PKS0625-35 also shows\nsuggestive evidence of spectral variability on timescales of months. The main\nfindings from the broadband analysis can be summarized as follows: 1) 3C444,\nPKS0625-35, and NGC1692 have alpha_OX values consistent with the well known\nalpha_OX -l_UV correlation. 2) No positive correlation is found between L_X and\nthe inclination angle, suggesting that the X-ray emission is not beamed. 3) The\nvalues of the radio-loudness are inversely proportional to the Eddington ratio\nand locate our objects in between the ``radio-loud'' and ``radio-quiet''\nbranches in the R- l_UV plane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2007 16:54:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We present numerical\nsimulations of the evolution of the circumstellar medium around a rapidly\nrotating 20 Msol star at a metallicity of Z=0.001. Its rotation is fast enough\nto produce quasi-chemically homogeneous evolution. While conventionally, a star\nof 20 Msol would not evolve into a Wolf-Rayet stage, the considered model\nevolves from the main sequence directly to the helium main sequence. We use the\ntime-dependent wind parameters, such as mass loss rate, wind velocity and\nrotation-induced wind anisotropy from the evolution model as input for a 2D\nhydrodynamical simulation. While the outer edge of the pressure-driven\ncircumstellar bubble is spherical, the circumstellar medium close to the star\nshows strong non-spherical features during and after the periods of\nnear-critical rotation. We conclude that the circumstellar medium around\nrapidly rotating massive stars differs considerably from the surrounding\nmaterial of non-rotating stars of similar mass. Multiple blue-shifted high\nvelocity absorption components in gamma-ray burst afterglow spectra are\npredicted. As a consequence of near critical rotation and short stellar\nevolution time scales during the last few thousand years of the star's life, we\nfind a strong deviation of the circumstellar density profile in the polar\ndirection from the 1/R^2 density profile normally associated with stellar winds\nclose to the star\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2007 19:44:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Within the\ncontext of standard cosmology, the Universe must therefore contain a third\n`dark' component of energy, beyond matter and radiation. However, the current\ndata are still deemed insufficient to distinguish between an evolving dark\nenergy component and the simplest model of a time-independent cosmological\nconstant. In this paper, we examine the role played by our cosmic horizon R0 in\nour interrogation of the data, and reach the rather firm conclusion that the\nexistence of a cosmological constant is untenable. The observations are telling\nus that R0=c t0, where t0 is the perceived current age of the Universe, yet a\ncosmological constant would drive R0 towards ct (where t is the cosmic time)\nonly once, and that would have to occur right now. In contrast, scaling\nsolutions simultaneously eliminate several conundrums in the standard model,\nincluding the `coincidence' and `flatness' problems, and account very well for\nthe fact that R0=c t0. We show here that for such dynamical dark energy models,\neither R0=ct for all time (thus eliminating the apparent coincidence\naltogether), or that what we believe to be the current age of the universe is\nactually the horizon time th=R0/c, which is always shorter than t0. Our best\nfit to the Type Ia supernova data indicates that t0 would then have to be ~16.9\nbillion years. Though surprising at first, an older universe such as this would\nactually eliminate several other long-standing problems in cosmology, including\nthe (too) early appearance of supermassive black holes (at a redshift > 6) and\nthe glaring deficit of dwarf halos in the local group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2007 19:50:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-11-30"}

In this context, we study the\nfundamental limitations on shear accuracy due to the measurement of the Point\nSpread Function (PSF) from the finite number of stars. In order to do that, we\ntranslate the accuracy required for cosmological parameter estimation to the\nminimum number of stars over which the PSF must be calibrated. We first derive\nour results analytically in the case of infinitely small pixels (i.e.\ninfinitely high resolution). Then image simulations are used to validate these\nresults and investigate the effect of finite pixel size in the case of an\nelliptical gaussian PSF. Our results are expressed in terms of the minimum\nnumber of stars required to calibrate the PSF in order to ensure that\nsystematic errors are smaller than statistical errors when estimating the\ncosmological parameters. On scales smaller than the area containing this\nminimum number of stars, there is not enough information to model the PSF. In\nthe case of an elliptical gaussian PSF and in the absence of dithering, 2\npixels per PSF Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) implies a 20% increase of the\nminimum number of stars compared to the ideal case of infinitely small pixels;\n0.9 pixels per PSF FWHM implies a factor 100 increase.

One example of a bifan is the two MAP-kinases, p38\nand JNK that phosphorylate and activate the two transcription factors ATF2 and\nElk-1. We have used a system of coupled ordinary differential equations to\nanalyze the regulatory capability of this bifan motif by itself, and when it\ninteracts with other motifs such as positive and negative feedback loops. Our\nresults indicate that bifans provide temporal regulation of signal propagation\nand act as signal sorters, filters, and synchronizers.

The current control system is based on voice\nrecognition. The range of vision is 360 degrees with an angle of 160 degrees .\nTwenty-three procedures were performed.

The ease of installation of the robot,\nwhich takes only 5 minutes, and the easy handling made it possible for 21 of\nthe 23 procedures to be performed without an assistant. CONCLUSION: The LER is\na camera holder guided by the surgeon's voice that can eliminate the need for\nan assistant during laparoscopic surgery.

For these results, which were published previously by\nthe authors in several places, some formulations and proofs are here corrected,\nand matters are updated. The categories investigated in this paper formalize\nequality of proofs in classical and intuitionistic conjunctive-disjunctive\nlogic without distribution of conjunction over disjunction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2007 15:46:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Dec 2007 09:50:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 Dec 2008 14:23:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-08"}
