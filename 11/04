As the mass and redshift of a galaxy\nhalo increase, the expected clustering of other galaxies around it gets\nstronger. It is therefore possible to verify the high-redshift identity of a\ngalaxy (prior to an unambiguous spectral identification) from the clustering of\nother galaxies around it. We illustrate this method for the massive galaxy\nsuggested by Mobasher et al. (2005) to be at redshift z~6.5.

Previous\ninvestigations revealed a lack of close systems in NGC 6752, which we confirm\nwith new, more extensive observations. Our estimate of the close binary\nfraction in this cluster is only 4%. From a review of the relevant literature,\nthere are indications that a low close binary fraction among extreme horizontal\nbranch (EHB) stars is a common feature in globular star clusters. On the other\nhand, the field EHB population shows evidence of a remarkably high binary\nfraction. Such a difference among globular cluster and field populations,\nalthough not yet explained in detail on the basis of theoretical models, must\nnecessarily be related to different formation histories for EHB stars in the\nfield and in clusters. In this framework, preliminary results indicate that\nclose systems could be relatively common in the peculiar globular cluster NGC\n2808, although the sample of studied stars is still small. This would imply\nthat not all clusters share the same behavior, as far as EHB star formation is\nconcerned.
