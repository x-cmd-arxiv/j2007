Here, the ATNF Catalog is scrutinized searching for\npulsar distances and proper motions. For a sample of 212 run away pulsars\n(RAPs), which currently run across the Galaxy at very high speed and undergo\nlarge displacements, some gravitational-wave (GW) signals produced by such\npresent accelerations appear to be detectable after calibration against the\nAdvanced LIGO (LIGO II). Motivated by this insight, we address the issue of the\npulsar kick at birth. We show that during the short rise fling each run away\npulsar (RAP) generates a GW signal with characteristic amplitude and frequency\nthat makes it detectable by current GW interferometers. For a realistic\nanalysis, an efficiency parameter is introduced to quantify the expenditure of\nthe rise fling kinetic energy, which is estimated from the linear momentum\nconservation law applied to the supernova explosion that kicks out the pulsar.\nThe remaining energy is supposed to be used to make the star to spin. Thus, a\ncomparison with the spin of ATNF pulsars having velocity in the interval\n400-500 km s$^{-1}$ is performed. The resulting difference suggests that other\nmechanisms should dissipate part of that energy to produce the observed pulsar\nspin periods. Meanwhile, the kick phenomenon may also occur in globular and\nopen star clusters at the formation or disruption of very short period compact\nbinary systems wherein abrupt velocity and acceleration similar to those given\nto RAPs during the short rise fling can be imparted to each orbital partner.\nThus pulsar astrometry from micro- to nano-arsec scales might be of much help.\nIn case of a supernova, the RAP GW signal could be a benchmark for the GW\nsignal from the core collapse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2007 16:11:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Oct 2008 20:36:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

We introduce a method to produce\nvignetting corrected images from the EPIC pn data, and we developed a procedure\nthat allows a correct background treatment for low surface brightness spectra,\nusing a local background, together with closed filter observations. Results:\nMost of the emission from the halo is at energies below 1 keV. In the disc,\nalso emission at higher energies is present. The extent of the diffuse emission\nalong the major axis of the disc is 13.6 kpc. The halo resembles a horn\nstructure and reaches out to ~9 kpc perpendicular to the disc. Disc regions\nthat cover star forming regions, like spiral arms, show harder spectra than\nregions with lower star forming activity.

Large-zenith-angle observations of three northern\nAGN (Mkn 421, Mkn 501, 1ES 1218+304), known to emit VHE gamma rays, were also\nperformed in order to sample their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) above 1\nTeV.

During their\nformation, present day galaxies may execute many such cycles across the Hubble\ndiagram. A good candidate for such a \"hermaphrodite\" galaxy is NGC 3108: a\ndust-lane early-type galaxy which has a large amount of HI gas distributed in a\nlarge scale disk. We present narrow band H_alpha and R-band imaging, and\ncompare the results with the HI distribution. The emission is in two\ncomponents: a nuclear bar and an extended disk component which coincides with\nthe HI distribution. This suggests that a stellar disk is currently being\nformed out of the HI gas.

We measure an extinction- corrected SFR of\n0.42 Msun/yr. The luminosity function of the HII regions is similar to other\nspiral galaxies, with a power law index of -2.1, suggesting that the star\nformation mechanism is similar to other spiral galaxies.

We continue in this vein, and study\nthe deletion phenomenon in the web by following two different sets of web-sites\n(each comprising more than 150,000 pages) over a one-year period. Empirical\ndata show that there is a significant deletion component in the underlying web\nnetworks, but the deletion process is not uniform. This motivates us to\nintroduce a new mechanism of preferential survival (PS), where nodes are\nremoved according to a degree-dependent deletion kernel. We use the mean-field\nrate equation approach to study a general dynamic model driven by Preferential\nAttachment (PA), Double PA (DPA), and a tunable PS, where c nodes (c<1) are\ndeleted per node added to the network, and verify our predictions via\nlarge-scale simulations. One of our results shows that, unlike in the case of\nuniform deletion, the PS kernel when coupled with the standard PA mechanism,\ncan lead to heavy-tailed power law networks even in the presence of extreme\nturnover in the network. Moreover, a weak DPA mechanism, coupled with PS, can\nhelp make the network even more heavy-tailed, especially in the limit when\ndeletion and insertion rates are almost equal, and the overall network growth\nis minimal.

The observed variations of the\ndiagnostic PAH ratios across M82 can be explained by extinction effects, within\nsystematic uncertainties. The 16-18um PAH complex is very prominent, and its\nequivalent width is enhanced outwards from the galactic plane. We interpret\nthis as a consequence of the variation of the UV radiation field. The EWs of\nthe 11.3um PAH feature and the H_2 S(1) line correlate closely, and we conclude\nthat shocks in the outflow regions have no measurable influence on the H_2\nemission.

This work presents a new method for the modeling of fringing\nfield, in which the effect of fringing field is modeled as a serial capacitor.\nNumerical simulation demonstrates the suitability of this formulation. Based on\nthis model, a robust control scheme is constructed using the theory of\ninput-to-state stabilization (ISS) and back-stepping state feedback design. The\nstability and the performance of the system using this control scheme are\ndemonstrated through both stability analysis and numerical simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2007 10:27:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-11-29"}

A residual neutral fraction is detected in the\nspectra of Quasi-Stellar Objects at both low and high redshifts, revealing a\nhighly fluctuating medium with temperatures characteristic of photoionized gas.\nThe statistics of the fluctuations are well-reproduced by numerical\ngravity-hydrodynamics simulations within the context of standard cosmological\nstructure formation scenarios. As such, the study of the IGM offers an\nopportunity to probe the nature of the primordial density fluctuations on\nscales unavailable to other methods. The simulations also suggest the IGM is\nthe dominant reservoir of baryons produced by the Big Bang, and so the\nprincipal source of the matter from which galaxies formed. The detection of\nmetal systems within the IGM shows that it was enriched by evolved stars early\nin its history, demonstrating an intimate connection between galaxy formation\nand the IGM. The author presents a comprehensive review of the current\nunderstanding of the structure and physical properties of the IGM and its\nrelation to galaxies, concluding with comments on prospects for furthering the\nstudy of the IGM using future ground-based facilities and space-based\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2007 12:10:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Aug 2008 15:55:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Dec 2008 12:13:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}
