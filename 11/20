The self-consistent solution of these\n1MFT-KS equations reproduces not only the density of the original electron\nsystem but also its 1-matrix.

ML decoding can be modeled as finding the most\nprobable path taken through a Markov graph. Integrated with the Viterbi\nalgorithm (VA), complexity reduction methods such as the sphere decoder often\nuse the sum log likelihood (SLL) of a Markov path as a bound to disprove the\noptimality of other Markov path sets and to consequently avoid exhaustive path\nsearch. In this paper, it is shown that SLL-based optimality tests are\ninefficient if one fixes the coding memory and takes the codeword length to\ninfinity. Alternatively, optimality of a source symbol at a given time index\ncan be testified using bounds derived from log likelihoods of the neighboring\nsymbols. It is demonstrated that such neighboring log likelihood (NLL)-based\noptimality tests, whose efficiency does not depend on the codeword length, can\nbring significant complexity reduction to ML decoding of convolutional codes.\nThe results are generalized to ML sequence detection in a class of\ndiscrete-time hidden Markov systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2007 07:27:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Nov 2007 00:15:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 31 Jul 2008 17:08:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

These systems have a size of\nabout 1 fm, which shows up in scattering experiments at low momentum transfers\n$Q$ in the GeV region. At this scale the running coupling constant of Quantum\nChromodynamics (QCD), the established theory of the strong interactions,\nbecomes divergent. It is therefore highly intriguing to explore this theory in\nthe realm of its strong interaction regime. However, the quarks and gluons can\nnot be resolved at the GeV scale but have to be studied through their\nmanifestations in the bound many-body systems, for instance pions, nucleons and\ntheir resonances. The review starts with a short overview of QCD at low\nmomentum transfer and a summary of the theoretical apparatus describing the\ninteraction of hadrons with electrons and photons. In the following sections we\npresent the experimental results for the most significant observables studied\nwith the electromagnetic probe: form factors, polarizabilities, excitation\nspectra, and sum rules. These experimental findings are compared and\ninterpreted with various theoretical approaches to QCD, such as\nphenomenological models with quarks and pions, dispersion relations as a means\nto connect observables from different experiments, and, directly based on the\nQCD lagrangian, chiral perturbation theory and lattice gauge theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2007 14:59:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}
