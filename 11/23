Spin\npolarized spectroscopy with Ni tips has been performed separately for the two\nphases, and the results compared with standard W and Pt tips. While PM exhibits\nfeatureless tunneling characteristics, the FM regions exhibit at room\ntemperature strongly nonlinear behavior with a band-gap like behavior. The spin\nresolved density of states of the FM regions of the manganite has been\nextracted by the deconvolution of the spectroscopic curves.

If we fix the coloring of the leaves, as $\\ell$ tends to\n$\\infty$, for what range of $k$ is the root uniformly distributed over all $k$\ncolors? This corresponds to the threshold for uniqueness of the infinite-volume\nGibbs measure. It is straightforward to show the existence of colorings of the\nleaves which ``freeze'' the entire tree when $k\\le\\Delta+1$. For\n$k\\geq\\Delta+2$, Jonasson proved the root is ``unbiased'' for any fixed\ncoloring of the leaves and thus the Gibbs measure is unique. What happens for a\n{\\em typical} coloring of the leaves? When the leaves have a non-vanishing\ninfluence on the root in expectation, over random colorings of the leaves,\nreconstruction is said to hold. Non-reconstruction is equivalent to extremality\nof the free-boundary Gibbs measure. When $k<\\Delta/\\ln{\\Delta}$, it is\nstraightforward to show that reconstruction is possible and hence the measure\nis not extremal.\n  We prove that for $C>1$ and $k =C\\Delta/\\ln{\\Delta}$, that the Gibbs measure\nis extremal in a strong sense: with high probability over the colorings of the\nleaves the influence at the root decays exponentially fast with the depth of\nthe tree. Closely related results were also proven recently by Sly. The above\nstrong form of extremality implies that a local Markov chain that updates\nconstant sized blocks has inverse linear entropy constant and hence $O(N\\log\nN)$ mixing time where $N$ is the number of vertices of the tree.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Nov 2007 03:12:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Jun 2008 16:22:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 29 Nov 2009 17:34:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-28"}

The star was monitored during several multisite campaigns which\nconfirmed the presence of radial and nonradial oscillations. Moreover, its\nexceptionally low rotational velocity makes 44 Tau particulary interesting for\nan asteroseismic study. Due to the measured log g value of 3.6 +/- 0.1, main\nsequence and post-main sequence models have to be considered. We perform mode\nidentification based on photometric and spectroscopic data. A nonadiabatic\npulsation code is used to compute models that fit the identified modes. The\ninfluence of different opacity tables and element mixtures on the results is\ntested. The observed frequencies of 44 Tau can be fitted in both the main\nsequence and the post-main sequence evolutionary stage. Post-main sequence\nmodels are preferable as they fulfill almost all observational constraints (fit\nof observed frequencies, position in the HRD and instability range). These\nmodels can be obtained with normal chemical composition which is in agreement\nwith recent spectroscopic measurements. The efficiency of envelope convection\n(in the framework of the mixing-length theory) is predicted to be very low in\n44 Tau.

In contrast\nthe familiar Born approximation of perturbation theory would not be adapted for\nthe localized regime since it constrains the reflection coefficient to be less\nthan one.

By comparing the self-consistent non-crossing\napproximation on the honeycomb lattice with perturbation theory on the Dirac\nfermions, we conclude, that the linear density of states of pure graphene\nchanges to a non-universal power-law, whose exponent depends on the strength of\ndisorder like 1-4g/sqrt{3}t^2\\pi, with g the variance of the Gaussian disorder,\nt the hopping integral. This can result in a significant suppression of the\nexponent of the density of states in the weak-disorder limit. We argue, that\neven a non-linear density of states can result in a conductivity being\nproportional to the number of charge carriers, in accordance with experimental\nfindings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Nov 2007 15:08:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Also the adsorption of the random copolymers is considered and found to\nbe well described within the framework of the annealed approximation.
