It is thus critical to understand their origins,\nevolution, and connection to the underlying dark matter distribution. To this\nend, we identify the dark matter halos (including subhalos) that are likely to\ncontain star-forming galaxies at z~2 (z2SFGs) within a large dissipationless\ncosmological simulation and then use halo merger histories to follow the\nevolution of z2SFG descendants to z~1 and z~0. The evolved halos at these\nepochs are then confronted with an array of observational data in order to\nuncover the likely descendants of z2SFGs. Though the evolved halos have\nclustering strengths comparable to red galaxies at z~1 and z~0, we find that\nthe bulk of z2SFGs do not evolve into red galaxies, at either epoch. This\nconclusion is based primarily on the fact that the space density of z2SFGs is\nmuch higher than that of lower redshift red galaxies, even when accounting for\nthe merging of z2SFG descendants, which decreases the number density of z2SFG\ndescendants by at most a factor of two by z~0. Of the ~50% of z2SFGs that\nsurvive to z~0, ~70% reside at the center of z~0 dark matter halos with M>10^12\nM_Sun/h. Halo occupation modeling of z~0 galaxies suggests that such halos are\noccupied by galaxies with M_r<-20.5, implying that these z2SFGs evolve into\n``typical'' ~ L* galaxies today, including our own Galaxy. The remaining ~30%\nbecome satellite galaxies by z~0, and comparison to halo occupation modeling\nsuggests that they are rather faint, with M_r<-19.5.

A key issue in that theory is to extract the gauge\ninvariant degrees of freedom which allow unambiguous comparison between theory\nand experiment. When one goes beyond first (linear) order, the task of writing\nthe Einstein equations expanded to n'th order in terms of quantities that are\ngauge invariant up to terms of higher orders becomes highly non-trivial and\ncumbersome. This fact has prevented progress for instance on the issue of the\nstability of linear perturbation theory and is a subject of current debate in\nthe literature. In this series of papers we circumvent these difficulties by\npassing to a manifestly gauge invariant framework. In other words, we only\nperturb gauge invariant, i.e. measurable quantities, rather than gauge variant\nones. Thus, gauge invariance is preserved non perturbatively while we construct\nthe perturbation theory for the equations of motion for the gauge invariant\nobservables to all orders. In this first paper we develop the general framework\nwhich is based on a seminal paper due to Brown and Kuchar as well as the\nrealtional formalism due to Rovelli. In the second, companion, paper we apply\nour general theory to FRW cosmologies and derive the deviations from the\nstandard treatment in linear order. As it turns out, these deviations are\nnegligible in the late universe, thus our theory is in agreement with the\nstandard treatment. However, the real strength of our formalism is that it\nadmits a straightforward and unambiguous, gauge invariant generalisation to\nhigher orders. This will also allow us to settle the stability issue in a\nfuture publication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2007 18:02:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Nov 2009 11:59:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-17"}

This function may thus be considered as some kind of\nLegendre transform of the BDDK formula and has its own value independently of\nthe Alday-Maldacena approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2007 19:12:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The manner in which the charge is\narranged on developing irregular structures can affect the fractal dimension of\naggregates formed during collisions, which in turn influences the coagulation\nrate and size evolution of the dust within the plasma cloud. This paper\npresents preliminary models for the charge and size evolution of fractal\naggregates immersed in a plasma environment calculated using a modification to\nthe orbital-motion-limited (OML) theory. Primary electron and ion currents\nincident on points on the aggregate surface are determined using a\nline-of-sight (LOS) approximation: only those electron or ion trajectories\nwhich are not blocked by another grain within the aggregate contribute to the\ncharging current. Using a self-consistent iterative approach, the equilibrium\ncharge and dipole moment are calculated for the dust aggregate. The charges are\nthen used to develop a heuristic charging scheme which can be implemented in\ncoagulation models. While most coagulation theories assume that it is difficult\nfor like-charged grains to coagulate, the OML_LOS approximation indicates that\nthe electric potentials of aggregate structures are often reduced enough to\nallow significant coagulation to occur.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2007 19:29:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Their presence poses a puzzle since these features are not expected\nto be hydrodynamically stable, or to remain sharp in the presence of diffusion.\nHowever, a moving core or bubble in even a very weakly magnetized plasma\nnecessarily sweeps up enough magnetic field to build up a dynamically important\nsheath around the object; the layer's strength is set by a competition between\n`plowing up' of field and field lines slipping around the core. We show that a\ntwo-dimensional approach to the problem is quite generally not possible. In\nthree dimensions, we show with analytic arguments and in numerical experiments,\nthat this magnetic layer modifies the dynamics of a plunging core, greatly\nmodifies the effects of hydrodynamic instabilities on the core, modifies the\ngeometry of stripped material, and even slows the fall of the core through\nmagnetic tension. We derive an expression for the maximum magnetic field\nstrength, the thickness of the layer, and the opening angle of the magnetic\nwake. The morphology of the magnetic draping layer implies the suppression of\nthermal conduction across the layer, thus conserving strong temperature\ngradients over the contact surface. The intermittent amplification of the\nmagnetic field as well as the injection of MHD turbulence in the wake of the\ncore is identified to be due to vorticity generation within the magnetic\ndraping layer. These results have important consequences for understanding the\nphysical properties and the complex gasdynamical processes of the intra-cluster\nmedium, and apply quite generally to motions through other magnetized\nenvironments, e.g., the ISM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2007 22:36:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2008 16:46:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

To this end, bulges\nhave been isolated for a sample of 137 spiral galaxies within the redshift\nrange 0.1<z<1.2 in the GOODS fields. Using proven photometric techniques we\ndetermine the characteristic parameters (size, surface brightness, profile\nshape) of both the disk and bulge components in our sample. In agreement with\nearlier work which utilized aperture colors, distant bulges show a broader\nrange of optical colors than would be the case for passively-evolving\npopulations. To quantify the amount of recent star formation necessary to\nexplain this result, we used the DEIMOS spectrograph to secure stellar velocity\ndispersions for a sizeable fraction of our sample. This has enabled us to\ncompare the Fundamental Plane of our distant bulges with that for spheroidal\ngalaxies in a similar redshift range. Bulges of spiral galaxies with a\nbulge-to-total luminosity ratio (B/T)>0.2 show very similar patterns of\nevolution to those seen for pure spheroidals such that the stellar populations\nof all spheroids with M>10^{11}Msun are homogeneously old, consistent with a\nsingle major burst of star formation at high redshift (z_f<~2), while bulges\nwith M<10^{11}Msun must have had more recent stellar mass growth (~10% in mass\nsince z~1). Although further data spanning a wider range of redshift and mass\nis desirable, the striking similarity between the assembly histories of bulges\nand low mass spheroidals is difficult to reconcile with the picture whereby the\nmajority of large bulges form primarily via secular processes within spiral\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2007 02:31:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We now present a\nhydrodynamical model that explains the known properties of the H-alpha emission\nand provides new insights on the lifetime of the Stream clouds. The upstream\nclouds are gradually disrupted due to their interaction with the hot halo gas.\nThe clouds that follow plough into gas ablated from the upstream clouds,\nleading to shock ionisation at the leading edges of the downstream clouds.\nSince the following clouds also experience ablation, and weaker H-alpha\n(100-200 mR) is quite extensive, a disruptive cascade must be operating along\nmuch of the Stream. In our model, the clouds are evolving on timescales of\n100-200 Myr, such that the Stream must be replenished by the Magellanic Clouds\nat a fairly constant rate. The ablated material falls onto the Galaxy as a warm\ndrizzle which suggests that diffuse ionized gas at 10**4 K may be an important\nconstituent of galactic accretion. The observed HI emission provides a new\nconstraint on the rate of disruption of the Stream and, consequently, the\ninfall rate of metal-poor gas onto the Galaxy.

We report a 3-fold diversification\ntriggered by two inherent features of the sponsored search market, namely,\ncapacity constraints and collusion-vulnerability of current mechanisms. In the\nfirst scenario, we present a comparative study of two models motivated by\ncapacity constraints - one where the additional capacity is provided by\nfor-profit agents, who compete for slots in the original auction, draw traffic,\nand run their own sub-auctions, and the other, where the additional capacity is\nprovided by the auctioneer herself, by essentially acting as a mediator and\nrunning a single combined auction.

In the present work,\nwe study the auctioneer-based model and show that this model seems inferior to\nthe mediator-based model in terms of revenue or efficiency guarantee due to\nadded capacity. In the second scenario, we initiate a game theoretic study of\ncurrent sponsored search auctions, involving incentive driven mediators who\nexploit the fact that these mechanisms are not collusion-resistant. In\nparticular, we show that advertisers can improve their payoffs by using the\nservices of the mediator compared to directly participating in the auction, and\nthat the mediator can also obtain monetary benefit, without violating incentive\nconstraints from the advertisers who do not use its services.

The magnetic flux densities\nretrieved from the individual analysis of the infrared and visible data sets\nare strongly correlated.

We show\nthat there is a possibility of a parametrically excited rotational-energy\npumping-process in the drift modes. It is indicated by the generation of a\ntoroidal component of the magnetic field that transforms the field lines into\nsuch a configuration, in which plasma particles do not experience any forces.\nAt this stage, the instability process saturates and the further amplification\nof the toroidal component to the magnetic field lines is suspended.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2007 12:15:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2008 09:46:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2008 12:41:07 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2008 08:17:33 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 21 Mar 2008 11:19:01 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sat, 7 Jun 2008 20:24:19 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Sun, 24 Aug 2008 14:22:57 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2009 10:24:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

An electrically gated quantum dot in\nthe Coulomb blockade regime can be tuned to hold a single unpaired spin-1/2,\nwhich is routinely spin-polarized by an applied magnetic field. Using\nferromagnetic electrodes, however, the properties of the quantum dot become\ndirectly spin-dependent and it has been demonstrated that the ferromagnetic\nelectrodes induce a local exchange-field which polarizes the localized spin in\nthe absence of any external fields. Here we report on the experimental\nrealization of this tunneling-induced spin-splitting in a carbon nanotube\nquantum dot coupled to ferromagnetic nickel-electrodes. We study the\nintermediate coupling regime in which single-electron states remain well\ndefined, but with sufficiently good tunnel-contacts to give rise to a sizable\nexchange-field. Since charge transport in this regime is dominated by the\nKondo-effect, we can utilize this sharp many-body resonance to read off the\nlocal spin-polarization from the measured bias-spectroscopy. We show that the\nexchange-field can be compensated by an external magnetic field, thus restoring\na zero-bias Kondo-resonance, and we demonstrate that the exchange-field itself,\nand hence the local spin-polarization, can be tuned and reversed merely by\ntuning the gate-voltage. This demonstrates a very direct electrical control\nover the spin-state of a quantum dot which, in contrast to an applied magnetic\nfield, allows for rapid spin-reversal with a very localized addressing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2007 14:49:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-20"}
