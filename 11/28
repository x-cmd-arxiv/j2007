While these two approximations are known to\nbe valid at low densities, this work investigates using such methods to model\nhigh-density, non-LTE emission spectra and determines at what point the\napproximations break down by comparing to spectra produced by the LANL code\nATOMIC which makes no such approximations.

Thus these approximations should be used with greater care\nwhen modeling high-density plasmas such as those found in inertial confinement\nfusion and electromagnetic pinch devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2007 19:29:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

To calculate the modified observable\ndistance-redshift relations, we introduce a generalized Dyer-Roeder method that\nallows for two crucial physical properties of the universe: inhomogeneities in\nthe expansion rate and the growth of the nonlinear structures. By treating the\ntransition redshift to the void-dominated era as a free parameter, we find a\nphenomenological fit to the observations from the CMB anisotropy, the position\nof the baryon oscillation peak, the magnitude-redshift relations of type Ia\nsupernovae, the local Hubble flow and the nucleosynthesis, resulting in a\nconcordant model of the universe with 90% dark matter, 10% baryons, no dark\nenergy, 15 Gyr as the age of the universe and a natural value for the\ntransition redshift z_0=0.35. Unlike a large local void, the model respects the\ncosmological principle, further offering an explanation for the late onset of\nthe perceived acceleration as a consequence of the forming nonlinear\nstructures. Additional tests, such as quantitative predictions for angular\ndeviations due to an anisotropic void distribution and a theoretical derivation\nof the model, can vindicate or falsify the interpretation that light\npropagation in voids is responsible for the perceived acceleration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2007 20:47:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Dec 2007 09:45:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2009 15:19:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-23"}

This regime\nis particularly relevant to the molecular knots that are commonly found in\nevolved planetary nebulae, such as the Helix Nebula, where traditional models\nof photodissociation regions have proved unable to explain the high observed\nluminosity in H_2 lines. In this paper we present results for the structure and\nsteady-state dynamics of such advection-dominated merged fronts, calculated\nusing the Cloudy plasma/molecular physics code. We find that the principal\ndestruction processes for H_2 are photoionization by extreme ultraviolet\nradiation and charge exchange reactions with protons, both of which form H_2^+,\nwhich rapidly combines with free electrons to undergo dissociative\nrecombination. Advection moves the dissociation front to lower column densities\nthan in the static case, which vastly increases the heating in the partially\nmolecular gas due to photoionization of He^0, H_2, and H^0. This causes a\nsignificant fraction of the incident bolometric flux to be re-radiated as\nthermally excited infrared H_2 lines, with the lower excitation pure rotational\nlines arising in 1000 K gas and higher excitation H_2 lines arising in 2000 K\ngas, as is required to explain the H_2 spectrum of the Helix cometary knots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2007 19:45:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2007 21:36:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Since only the spin degrees of freedom are involved in\nthe Kondo interaction, and due to spin-charge separation in 1D, the universal\nlow energy long distance physics of the Kondo model also arises when a magnetic\nimpurity is coupled to the end of a gap-less antiferromagnetic J_1-J_2 spin-1/2\nchain, where J_1(J_2) is the (next-)nearest neighbor coupling. Experimental\nrealizations of such spin chain models are possible and using various\nanalytical and numerical techniques, we present a detailed and quantitative\ncomparison between the usual free electron Kondo model and such spin chain\nversions of the Kondo problem. For the gap-less J_1-J_2 spin chain two cases\nare studied, with zero next nearest neighbor coupling, J_2=0, and with a\ncritical second neighbor coupling, J_2=J_2c. We first focus on the spin chain\nimpurity model at J_2c~0.2412 where a bulk marginal coupling present in the\nspin chain model for J_2<J_2c vanishes. At J_2c, the usual Kondo physics is\nrecovered in the spin chain model in the low energy regime. We then analyze the\nnearest-neighbor model (J_2=0) where a new kind of Kondo effect occurs due to\nthe presence of the bulk marginal coupling. This marginal coupling leads to a\nslower variation of the Kondo temperature T_K with the bare Kondo coupling. In\nthe exact Bethe ansatz solution of this spin chain impurity model (J_2=0) Frahm\nand Zvyagin noted this relation as well as the connection to the Kondo problem.\nHere, we provide further evidence for the connection to Kondo physics and\npresent low temperature QMC results for the impurity susceptibility that\nfurther support this connection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2007 21:00:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-03-05"}

This amounts\nprimarily to constraints on two numbers: the amplitude and slope of the 21 cm\npower spectrum on the scales probed. We find, however, that the redshift\nevolution in these quantities can yield important information about\nreionization. Although the power spectrum differs substantially across\nplausible models, a generic prediction is that the amplitude of the 21 cm power\nspectrum on MWA scales peaks near the epoch when the intergalactic medium (IGM)\nis ~ 50% ionized. Moreover, the slope of the 21 cm power spectrum on MWA scales\nflattens as the ionization fraction increases and the sizes of the HII regions\ngrow. Considering detection sensitivity, we show that the optimal MWA antenna\nconfiguration for power spectrum measurements would pack all 500 antenna tiles\nas close as possible in a compact core. The MWA is sensitive enough in its\noptimal configuration to measure redshift evolution in the slope and amplitude\nof the 21 cm power spectrum.

In\nthe MAD, the mass accretes in a form of irregular dense spiral streams and the\nvertical field, split into separate bundles, penetrates through the disk plane\nin low-density magnetic islands.

For such a scenario, a secondary user\nusually has to trade off between two conflicting goals at the same time: one is\nto maximize its own transmit throughput; and the other is to minimize the\namount of interference it produces at each primary receiver. In this paper, we\nstudy this fundamental tradeoff from an information-theoretic perspective by\ncharacterizing the secondary user's channel capacity under both its own\ntransmit-power constraint as well as a set of interference-power constraints\neach imposed at one of the primary receivers. In particular, this paper\nexploits multi-antennas at the secondary transmitter to effectively balance\nbetween spatial multiplexing for the secondary transmission and interference\navoidance at the primary receivers. Convex optimization techniques are used to\ndesign algorithms for the optimal secondary transmit spatial spectrum that\nachieves the capacity of the secondary transmission. Suboptimal solutions for\nease of implementation are also presented and their performances are compared\nwith the optimal solution. Furthermore, algorithms developed for the\nsingle-channel transmission are also extended to the case of multi-channel\ntransmission whereby the secondary user is able to achieve opportunistic\nspectrum sharing via transmit adaptations not only in space, but in time and\nfrequency domains as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2007 03:56:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Recent\ndiscoveries bring the total number of measured LMXB spin rates to 22. An open\nquestion is why the majority of the ~100 known neutron stars in LMXBs show\nneither pulsations nor burst oscillations.\n  Recent observations suggest that persistent pulsations may be more common\nthan previously thought, although detectable intermittently, and in some cases\nat very low duty cycles. For example, the 377.3 Hz pulsations in HETE\nJ1900.1-2455 were only present in the first few months of it's outburst, and\nhave been absent since (although X-ray activity continues). Intermittent\n(persistent) pulsations have since been detected in a further two sources. In\ntwo of these three systems the pulsations appear to be related to the\nthermonuclear burst activity, but in the third (Aql X-1) they are not. This\nphenomenon offers new opportunities for spin measurements in known systems.\n  Such measurements can constrain the poorly-known neutron star equation of\nstate, and neutron stars in LMXBs offer observational advantages over\nrotation-powered pulsars which make the detection of more rapidly-spinning\nexamples more likely. Even so, spin rates of at least 50% faster than the\npresent maximum appear necessary to give constraints stringent enough to\ndiscriminate between the various models.

In particular, we determine the relative biases of\ngroups of different masses, as well as that of groups with the same mass but\nwith different colors. In agreement with previous studies, we find that more\nmassive groups are more strongly clustered, and the inferred mass dependence of\nthe halo bias is in good agreement with predictions for the $\\Lambda$CDM\ncosmology. Regarding the color dependence, we find that groups with red\ncentrals are more strongly clustered than groups of the same mass but with blue\ncentrals. Similar results are obtained when the color of a group is defined to\nbe the total color of its member galaxies. The color dependence is more\nprominent in less massive groups and becomes insignificant in groups with\nmasses $\\gta 10^{14}\\msunh$. We construct a mock galaxy redshift survey\nconstructed from the large Millenium simulation that is populated with galaxies\naccording to the semi-analytical model of Croton et al. Applying our group\nfinder to this mock survey, and analyzing the mock data in exactly the same way\nas the true data, we are able to accurately recover the intrinsic mass and\ncolor dependencies of the halo bias in the model. This suggests that our group\nfinding algorithm and our method of assigning group masses do not induce\nspurious mass and/or color dependencies in the group-galaxy correlation\nfunction. The semi-analytical model reveals the same color dependence of the\nhalo bias as we find in our group catalogue.

A model atom for H I is\npresented. An effective temperature was obtained from the Balmer Halpha and\nHbeta line wing fits, the surface gravity from the Hipparcos parallax if\navailable and the non-LTE ionization balance between Ca I and Ca II. Based on\nthe hyperfine structure affecting the Ba II resonance line, the fractional\nabundance of the odd isotopes of Ba was derived for HD 84937 and HD 122563 from\na requirement that Ba abundances from the resonance line and subordinate lines\nof Ba II must be equal. For each star, non-LTE leads to a consistency of Teff\nfrom two Balmer lines and to a higher temperature compared to the LTE case, by\nup to 60 K. Non-LTE effects are important in spectroscopic determination of\nsurface gravity from Ca I/Ca II. For each star with a known trigonometric\ngravity, non-LTE abundances from the lines of two ionization stages agree\nwithin the error bars, while a difference in the LTE abundances consists of\n0.23 dex to 0.40 dex for different stars. Departures from LTE are found to be\nsignificant for the investigated atoms, and they strongly depend on stellar\nparameters. For HD 84937, the Eu/Ba ratio is consistent with the relative solar\nsystem r-process abundances, and the fraction of the odd isotopes of Ba, f_odd,\nequals 0.43+-0.14.

We\nassess the role of two pairs of reactions that influence the stability of these\nswitches: TF-TF homodimerisation and TF-DNA association/dissociation.

For this purpose, we\nwork in the framework of the Hidden Local Symmetry (HLS) Lagrangian and modify\nthe vector meson mass term by including the pion and kaon loop contributions.\nThis leads us to define the physical rho, omega and phi fields as linear\ncombinations of their ideal partners, with coefficients being meromorphic\nfunctions of s, the square of the 4--momentum flowing into the vector meson\nlines. This allows us to define a dynamical, i.e. s-dependent, vector meson\nmixing scheme.

The model provides a simultaneous,\nconsistent and good description of the e+e- and tau dipion spectra. The\nexpression for pion form factor in the latter case is derived from those in the\nformer case by switching off the isospin breaking effects specific to e+e- and\nswitching on those for tau decays.

This anomalous fluctuation can be an evidence\nfor cooperativity among the motors in action because fluctuation should be\naveraged out for a long filament if the action of each motor is independent. In\norder to understand the nature of the fluctuation in molecular motors, we\nperform numerical simulations and analyse velocity correlation in three\nexisting models that are known to show some kind of cooperativity and/or large\ndiffusion coefficient, i.e. Sekimoto-Tawada model [K.

It is shown that Prost model and Duke model do not give a finite\ndiffusion in the long filament limit in spite of collective action of motors.\nOn the other hand, Sekimoto-Tawada model has been shown to give the diffusion\ncoefficient that is independent of filament length, but it comes from the long\ntime correlation whose time scale is proportional to filament length, and our\nsimulations show that such a long correlation time conflicts with the\nexperimental time scales. We conclude that none of the three models do not\nrepresent experimental findings. In order to explain the observed anomalous\ndiffusion, we have to seek for the mechanism that should allow both the\namplitude and the time scale of the velocity correlation to be independent of\nthe filament length.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2007 13:53:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-11-29"}

The aim of the current\npaper is to describe a computer-assisted surgical navigation system based on\nfluoroscopic X-ray image calibration and three-dimensional optical localizers\nin order to reduce radiation exposure while increasing accuracy and reliability\nof the surgical procedure for pedicle screw insertion. Instrumentation using\ntranspedicular screw fixation was performed: in a first group, a conventional\nsurgical procedure was carried out with 26 patients (138 screws); in a second\ngroup, a navigated surgical procedure (virtual fluoroscopy) was performed with\n26 patients (140 screws). Evaluation of screw placement in every case was done\nby using plain X-rays and post-operative computer tomography scan. A 5 per cent\ncortex penetration (7 of 140 pedicle screws) occurred for the computer-assisted\ngroup. A 13 per cent penetration (18 of 138 pedicle screws) occurred for the\nnon computer-assisted group. The radiation running time for each vertebra level\n(two screws) reached 3.5 s on average in the computer-assisted group and 11.5 s\non average in the non computer-assisted group. The operative time for two\nscrews on the same vertebra level reaches 10 min on average in the non\ncomputer-assisted group and 11.9 min on average in the computer-assisted group.\nThe fluoroscopy-based (two-dimensional) navigation system for pedicle screw\ninsertion is a safe and reliable procedure for surgery in the lower thoracic\nand lumbar spine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2007 15:19:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-11-29"}

The specialist moves a mock-up of the ultrasound\nprobe at the master site, and the robot reproduces the movements of the real\nprobe, which sends back ultrasound images and force feedback. This tool could\nbe used to perform ultrasound examinations in small health care centers or from\nisolated sites. The objective of this study was to prove, under real\nconditions, the feasibility and reliability of the TER system in detecting\nabdominal aortic and iliac aneurysms. METHODS: Fifty-eight patients were\nincluded in 2 centers in Brest and Grenoble, France. The remote examination was\ncompared with the reference standard, the bedside examination, for aorta and\niliac artery diameter measurement, detection and description of aneurysms,\ndetection of atheromatosis, the duration of the examination, and acceptability.\nRESULTS: All aneurysms (8) were detected by both techniques as intramural\nthrombosis and extension to the iliac arteries. The interobserver correlation\ncoefficient was 0.982 (P < .0001) for aortic diameters. The rate of concordance\nbetween 2 operators in evaluating atheromatosis was 84% +/- 11% (95% confidence\ninterval).
