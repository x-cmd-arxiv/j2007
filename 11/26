We interpret this as the signature\nof enhanced star formation induced by tidal interactions. We then explore how\nthe average star formation rate in a galaxy is enhanced as the projected\nseparation r_p between the galaxy and its companions decreases. We find that\nthe enhancement depends strongly on r_p, but very weakly on the relative\nluminosity of the companions. The enhancement is also stronger in low mass\ngalaxies than in high mass galaxies. In order to explore whether a tidal\ninteraction is not only sufficient, but also necessary to trigger enhanced star\nformation in a galaxy, we compute background subtracted neighbour counts for\nthe galaxies in our sample. The average number of close neighbours around\ngalaxies with low to average values of SFR/M* is close to zero. At the highest\nspecific star formation rates, however, more than 40% of the galaxies in our\nsample have a companion within a projected radius of 100 kpc. Visual inspection\nof the highest SFR/M* galaxies without companions reveals that more than 50% of\nthese are clear interacting or merging systems.

Finally, we find clear evidence that tidal\ninteractions not only lead to enhanced star formation in galaxies, but also\ncause structural changes such as an increase in concentration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Nov 2007 17:27:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2008 13:23:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

In\nits ultimate generality, the restless bandit problem is known to be PSPACE-Hard\nto approximate to any non-trivial factor, and little progress has been made\ndespite its importance in modeling activity allocation under uncertainty.\n  We consider a special case that we call Feedback MAB, where the reward\nobtained by playing each of n independent arms varies according to an\nunderlying on/off Markov process whose exact state is only revealed when the\narm is played. The goal is to design a policy for playing the arms in order to\nmaximize the infinite horizon time average expected reward. This problem is\nalso an instance of a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), and\nis widely studied in wireless scheduling and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)\nrouting. Unlike the stochastic MAB problem, the Feedback MAB problem does not\nadmit to greedy index-based optimal policies.\n  We develop a novel and general duality-based algorithmic technique that\nyields a surprisingly simple and intuitive 2+epsilon-approximate greedy policy\nto this problem. We then define a general sub-class of restless bandit problems\nthat we term Monotone bandits, for which our policy is a 2-approximation. Our\ntechnique is robust enough to handle generalizations of these problems to\nincorporate various side-constraints such as blocking plays and switching\ncosts. This technique is also of independent interest for other restless bandit\nproblems.

Measured values of the electrical conductivity of molecular\nhydrogen yield radii of maximum penetration of 0.96R_J and 0.86R_S, with\nuncertainties of a few percent of R. At these radii, the magnetic Reynolds\nnumber based on the zonal wind velocity and the scale height of the magnetic\ndiffusivity is of order unity.

As more complex grid applications make use of work flows in their\ndesign and deployment it is reasonable to consider the impact of work flow\ndeployment over a Volunteer Computing infrastructure. In this case, the inter\nwork flow I/O can lead to a significant increase in I/O demands at the work\npool server. A possible solution is the use of a Peer-to- Peer based parallel\ncomputing architecture to off-load this I/O demand to the workers; where the\nworkers can fulfill some aspects of work flow coordination and I/O checking,\netc. However, achieving robustness in such a large scale system is a\nchallenging hurdle towards the decentralized execution of work flows and\ngeneral parallel processes.

The\nexponent of the leading small-k behavior depends in a simple manner on the\nnature of the correlation properties of the specific tiling and on the\nconservation of the mass moments of the tiles. Assigning one point to the\ncenter of mass of each tile gives the exponent \\gamma=4 for any tiling in which\nthe shapes and orientations of the tiles are short-range correlated. Smaller\nexponents, in the range 4-d<\\gamma<4 (and thus always superhomogeneous for\nd\\leq 4), may be obtained in the case that the latter quantities have\nlong-range correlations.

Which link should\nyou choose in such an online scenario? When you are not sure where the\ninformation you require resides, you will initiate a navigation session. This\ninvolves pruning some of the links and following one of the others, where more\npruning is likely to happen the deeper you navigate. In terms of decision\nmaking, the utility of navigation diminishes with distance until finally the\nutility drops to zero and the session is terminated. Under this model of\nnavigation, we call the number of nodes that are available after pruning, for\nbrowsing within a session, the {\\em potential gain} of the starting web page.\nThus the parameters that effect the potential gain are the local branching\nfactor with respect to the starting web page and the discount factor.\n  We first consider the case when the discounting factor is geometric. We show\nthat the distribution of the effective number of links that the user can follow\nat each navigation step after pruning, i.e. the number of nodes added to the\npotential gain at that step, is given by the {\\em erf} function. We derive an\napproximation to the potential gain of a web page and show that this is\nnumerically a very accurate estimate.

Under this assumption, many nice properties have been\nshown about quantum zero knowledge, including the fact that Honest-Verifier\nQuantum Statistical Zero Knowledge (HVQSZK) is equal to Cheating-Verifier\nQuantum Statistical Zero Knowledge (QSZK) (see [Wat02,Wat06]).\n  In this paper, we study what happens when we allow an honest verifier to flip\nsome coins in addition to using unitary operations. Flipping a coin is a\nnon-unitary operation but doesn't seem at first to enhance the cheating\npossibilities of the verifier since a classical honest verifier can flip coins.\nIn this setting, we show an unexpected result: any classical Interactive Proof\nhas an Honest-Verifier Quantum Statistical Zero Knowledge proof with coins.\nNote that in the classical case, honest verifier SZK is no more powerful than\nSZK and hence it is not believed to contain even NP. On the other hand, in the\ncase of cheating verifiers, we show that Quantum Statistical Zero Knowledge\nwhere the verifier applies any non-unitary operation is equal to Quantum\nZero-Knowledge where the verifier uses only unitaries.\n  One can think of our results in two complementary ways. If we would like to\nuse the honest verifier model as a means to study the general model by taking\nadvantage of their equivalence, then it is imperative to use the unitary\ndefinition without coins, since with the general one this equivalence is most\nprobably not true. On the other hand, if we would like to use quantum zero\nknowledge protocols in a cryptographic scenario where the honest-but-curious\nmodel is sufficient, then adding the unitary constraint severely decreases the\npower of quantum zero knowledge protocols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2007 15:37:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2007 14:45:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Oct 2008 13:09:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-27"}

It is\ndemonstrated by examples that both results are sharp.\n  We apply these results to obtain a \"many barriers-type\" criterion for the\nexistence of square-summable generalized eigenfunctions of an unbounded Jacobi\nmatrix at almost every value of the spectral parameter in suitable open sets.\nAs an application, we provide examples of unbounded Jacobi matrices with a\nspectral mobility edge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2007 15:46:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Jul 2008 16:21:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-30"}

We apply\nthree continous-wave driving fields and a pulsed probe field such that they\nform a closed interaction loop. Due to the closed loop and the finite frequency\nwidth of the probe pulses the multiphoton resonance condition cannot be\nfulfilled, such that a time-dependent analysis is required. By identifying the\ndifferent underlying physical processes we determine the parts of the solution\nrelevant to calculate the linear and nonlinear response of the system. We find\nthat the system can exhibit a strong intensity dependent refractive index with\nsmall absorption over a range of several natural linewidths. For a realistic\nexample we include Doppler and pressure broadening and calculate the nonlinear\nselfphase modulation in a gas cell with Sodium vapor and Argon buffer gas.
