Several\nclasses of radicals have been identified and related to reactions of the\nprimary radiolytically generated electrons and holes. Large yields of terminal\nand penultimate C-centered radicals are observed in the aliphatic chains of the\nphosphonium, ammonium and pyrrolidinium cations, but not for imidazolium\ncation. This pattern can be accounted for by efficient deprotonation of a hole\ntrapped on the cation (the radical dication) that competes with rapid charge\ntransfer to a nearby anion. The latter leads to the formation of stable N- or\nO-centered radicals. The electrons either react with the protic impurity (for\nnonaromatic cations) yielding H atoms or the aromatic moiety (for imidazolium\ncations). Excitation of bis(triflyl)amide anion is shown to yield\ntrifluoromethyl radical; the yield of this radical in radiolysis, though, is\nlow (< 10% of the alkyl radical yield).
