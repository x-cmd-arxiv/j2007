The inferred shock velocity of ~4700 km/s has been commonly\ninterpreted as the velocity of the `bullet' subcluster itself. This velocity is\nunexpectedly high in the LCDM cosmology, which may require non-trivial\nmodifications in the dark sector to be accommodated if taken at face value.\nHere we present explicit hydrodynamical toy models of galaxy cluster mergers\nwhich very well reproduce the observed dynamical state of 1E0657-56 and the\nmass models inferred from gravitational lensing observations. However, despite\na shock speed of 4500 km/s, the subcluster's mass centroid is moving only with\n2600 km/s in the rest frame of the system. The difference arises in part due to\na gravitationally induced inflow velocity of the gas ahead of the shock, which\namounts to ~1100 km/s for our assumed 10:1 mass ratio of the merger. A second\neffect is that the shock front moves faster than the subcluster itself. A\ngeneric LCDM collision model, where a bullet subcluster with concentration\nc=7.2 merges with a parent cluster with concentration c=3 on a zero-energy\norbit, reproduces all the main observational features seen in 1E0657-56 with\ngood accuracy, suggesting that 1E0657-56 is well in line with expectations from\nstandard cosmological models. In theories with an additional 5th-force in the\ndark sector, the subcluster can be accelerated beyond the velocity reached in\nLCDM, and the spatial offset between the X-ray peak and the mass centroid of\nthe subcluster can be significantly enlarged.

Using the shearing box approximation, we derive the\nform of these waves using a semi-analytic approach and go on to study their\nstability. The results are compared to those of numerical simulations performed\nusing finite difference approaches such as employed by ZEUS as well as Godunov\nmethods. When the wave frequency is between Omega and two Omega (where Omega is\nthe disk orbital angular velocity), it can couple resonantly with a pair of\nlinear inertial waves and thus undergo a parametric instability. Neglecting the\ndisk vertical stratification, we derive an expression for the growth rate when\nthe amplitude of the background wave is small. Good agreement is found with the\nresults of numerical simulations performed both with finite difference and\nGodunov codes. During the nonlinear phase of the instability, the flow remains\nwell organised if the amplitude of the background wave is small. However,\nstrongly nonlinear waves break down into turbulence. In both cases, the\nbackground wave is damped and the disk eventually returns to a stationary\nstate. Finally, we demonstrate that the instability also develops when density\nstratification is taken into account and so is robust. This destabilisation of\nfreely propagating nonlinear sound waves may be important for understanding the\ncomplicated behaviour of density waves in disks that are unstable through the\neffects of self-gravity or magnetic fields and is likely to affect the\npropagation of waves that are tidally excited by objects such as a protoplanet\nor companion perturbing a protoplanetary disk.

We introduce atomic-resolution\ntunneling-asymmetry imaging, finding virtually identical phenomena in two\nlightly hole-doped cuprates: Ca1.88Na0.12CuO2Cl2 and Bi2Sr2Dy0.2Ca0.8Cu2O8+d.\nIntense spatial variations in tunneling asymmetry occur primarily at the planar\noxygen sites; their spatial arrangement forms a Cu-O-Cu bond centered\nelectronic pattern without long range order but with 4a0-wide unidirectional\nelectronic domains dispersed throughout (a0: the Cu-O-Cu distance). The\nemerging picture is then of a partial hole-localization within an intrinsic\nelectronic glass evolving, at higher hole-densities, into complete\ndelocalization and highest temperature superconductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2007 22:29:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We argue that flow observables within systems with a non-negligible\nmean free path should acquire a \"dynamical\" fluctuation, due to the random\nnature of each collision between the system's degrees of freedom. Because of\nthis, $v_2$ fluctuations can be used to estimate the Knudsen number of the\nsystem produced at RHIC. To illustrate this quantitatively, we apply the UrQMD\nmodel, with scaled cross sections, to show that collisions at RHIC have a\nKnudsen number at least one order of magnitude above the expected value for an\ninteracting hadron gas. Furthermore, we argue that the Knudsen number is also\nbound from above by the $v_2$ fluctuation data, because too large a Knudsen\nnumber would break the observed scaling of $v_2$ fluctuations due to the onset\nof turbulent flow. We propose, therefore that $v_2$ fluctuation measurements,\ntogether with an understanding of the turbulent regime for relativistic\nhydrodynamics, will provide an upper as well as a lower limit for the Knudsen\nnumber.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2007 17:59:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 2010 00:38:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

This paper is an\ninitial step in that direction. The field scales at which the different\nmagnetic phases of a color superconductor with three quark flavors can be\nrealized are investigated. Coming from weak to strong fields, the system\nundergoes first a symmetry transmutation from a Color-Flavor-Locked (CFL) phase\nto a Magnetic-CFL (MCFL) phase, and then a phase transition from the MCFL phase\nto the Paramagnetic-CFL (PCFL) phase.

Such systems are\ncommonly simulated using rate equations, that account for the concentrations of\nthe mRNAs and proteins produced by these genes. Rate equations are suitable\nwhen the concentrations of the relevant molecules in a cell are large and\nfluctuations are negligible. However, when some of the proteins in the circuit\nappear in low copy numbers, fluctuations become important and the rate\nequations fail. In this case stochastic methods, such as direct numerical\nintegration of the master equation or Monte Carlo simulations are required.\nHere we present deterministic and stochastic simulations of the autorepressor,\nthe switch and the repressilator. We show that fluctuations give rise to\nquantitative and qualitative changes in the dynamics of these systems. In\nparticular, we demonstrate a fluctuations-induced bistability in a variant of\nthe genetic switch and and noisy oscillations obtained in the repressilator\ncircuit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2007 07:01:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
