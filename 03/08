Previous studies for simple initial configurations with two\nequal-mass planets revealed some discrepancies between the results of numerical\nsimulations and the observed orbital elements of extrasolar planets. Here, we\nshow that simulations with two unequal mass planets starting on nearly circular\norbits predict a reduced frequency of collisions and a broader range of final\neccentricities. The two-planet scattering model can easily reproduce the\nobserved eccentricities with a plausible distribution of planet mass ratios.\nFurther, the two-planet scattering model predicts a maximum eccentricity of\nabout 0.8, independent of the distribution of planet mass ratios, provided that\nboth planets are initially place on nearly circular orbits. This compares\nfavorably with current observations and will be tested by future planet\ndiscoveries. The combination of planet--planet scattering and tidal\ncircularization may be able to explain the existence of some giant planets with\nvery short period orbits. Orbital migration due to planet scattering could play\nan important role in explaining the increased rate of giant planets with very\nshort period orbits. We also re-examine and discuss various possible\ncorrelations between eccentricities and other properties of observed extrasolar\nplanets.

Recent numerical\nrelativity simulations suggest that the recoil velocity can be as high as a few\nthousands kilometers per second for particular configurations. We consider here\nthe effect of a worst case scenario for orbital and phase configurations on the\nhierarchical evolution of the massive black hole (MBH) population. The orbital\nconfiguration and spin orientation in the plane is chosen to be the one\nyielding the highest possible kick. Masses and spin magnitudes are instead\nderived self-consistently from the MBH evolutionary models. If seeds form\nearly, e.g. as remnants of the first stars, almost the totality of the first\nfew generation of binaries are ejected. The fraction of lost binaries decreases\nat later times due to a combination of the binary mass ratio distribution\nbecoming shallower, and the deepening of the hosts potential wells. If seeds\nform at later times, in more massive halos, the retention rate is much higher.\nWe show that the gravitational recoil does not pose a threat to the evolution\nof the MBH population that we observe locally in either case, although high\nmass seeds seem to be favored. The gravitational recoil is instead a real\nhazard for (i) MBHs in biased halos at high-redshift, where mergers are more\ncommon, and the potential wells still relatively shallow. Similarly, it is very\nchallenging to retain (ii) MBHs merging in star clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2007 15:26:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2007 14:17:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 May 2007 21:41:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

As for the isospin analysis and\nthe CKM angle alpha it is shown that the use of uniform priors for the observed\nquantities in the Explicit Solution parametrization is equivalent to a\nfrequentist construction resulting from a change of variables, and thus relies\nneither on prior PDFs nor on Bayes' theorem. This procedure provides in this\nparticular case results that are similar to the Confidence Level approach, but\nthe treatment of mirror solutions remains incorrect and it is far from being\ngeneral.

In particular the frequentist result preserves the\nexact degeneracy that is expected from the remaining symmetries of the problem\nwhile the Bayesian procedure does not. Moreover, in the Bayesian approach\nreducing inference to the 68% or 95% credible interval is a misconception of\nthe meaning of the posterior PDF, which in turn implies that the significant\ndependence of the latter to the chosen parametrization cannot be viewed as a\nminor effect, contrary to the claim in hep-ph/0701204.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Mar 2007 17:16:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2007 12:49:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The examinations are concluded by a\ndiscussion of the interaction picture and its relation to scattering processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2007 14:50:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
