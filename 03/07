The\nresulting high-resolution mosaic shows numerous new shocks and resolves many\nknown shocks into multiple components. Using previous observations taken 9\nyears earlier we calculate a proper motion map and combine this with Spitzer 24\nmicron observations of the embedded young stars. The combined H2 mosaic shows\nmany new shocks and faint structures in the HH flows. From the proper motion\nmap we find that most HH objects belong to two major bi-polar HH flows, the\nlarge-scale roughly North-South oriented flow from central L1641N and a\npreviously unseen HH flow in eastern L1641N. Combining the tangential velocity\nmap with the mid-IR Spitzer images, two very likely outflow sources are found.\nThe outflow source of the eastern flow, L1641N-172, is found to be the\ncurrently brightest mid-IR source in L1641N and seem to have brightened\nconsiderably during the past 20 years. We make the first detection of this\nsource in the near-IR (Ks) and also find a near-IR reflection nebula pointing\nat the source, probably the illuminated walls of a cone-shaped cavity cleared\nout by the eastern lobe of the outflow. Extending a line from the eastern\noutflow source along the proper motion vector we find that HH 301 and HH 302\n(almost 1 pc away) belong to this new HH flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2007 19:27:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

However, we have recently discovered that these PDS\nresult from the improper addition/subtraction of non-simultaneous lightcurves.\nAims: To understand the properties and origins of the artefact. Methods: We\nre-analysed our XMM-Newton observations of M31 with non-simultaneous and\nsimultaneous lightcurves, then combined simulated lightcurves at various\nintensities with various offsets and found that the artefact is more dependent\non the offset than the intensity. Results: The lightcurves produced by the\nXMM-Newton Science Analysis Software (SAS) are non-synchronised by default.\nThis affects not only the combination of lightcurves from the three EPIC\ndetectors (MOS1, MOS2 and pn), but also background subtraction in the same CCD.\nIt is therefore imperative that all SAS-generated lightcurves are synchronised\nby time filtering, even if the whole observation is to be used. We also find\nthat the reported timing behaviour for NGC 4559 ULX-7 was also contaminated by\nthe artefact; there is no significant variability in the correctly-combined\nlightcurves of NGC 4559 ULX-7. Hence, the classification of this source as an\nintermediate-mass black hole is no longer justified.

The PA-swing\nis used to constrain possible geometries of the pulsar and the single-pulse\ndata is analysed for subpulse modulation correlations between the main pulse\nand interpulse. We confirm earlier conclusions that the dipole axis of this\npulsar is almost perpendicular to its rotation axis, and report that both its\nmain pulse and interpulse are modulated with a periodicity around 10.4 times\nthe pulsar's rotation. Allowing for the half-period delay between main pulse\nand interpulse the modulation is found to be precisely in phase. Despite small\nsecular variations in the periodicity, the phase-locking continues over all\ntimescales ranging up to several years. The precision of the phase locking is\ndifficult for current emission theories to explain if the main pulse and\ninterpulse originate from opposing magnetic poles. We therefore also explore\nthe possibility of a bidirectional model, in which all the modulated emission\ncomes from one pole, but is seen from two sides and slightly displaced by\naberration and time-delay. In this model the unmodulated emission is directed\nto us from the opposite pole, requiring the emission of the main pulse to\noriginate from two different poles. This is difficult to reconcile with the\nobserved smooth PA-swing.

In NGC 4303 the kinematical data\nrequire the presence of a BH with mass $M_{BH}=(5.0)^{+0.87}_{-2.26}\\times\n10^{6}M_{\\odot}$ (for a disk inclination $i=70$ deg).In NGC 4258, the observed\nkinematics require the presence of a black hole with $M_{BH}=\n(7.9)^{+6.2}_{-3.5} \\times 10^{7}M_{\\odot}$ ($i=60$ deg). This result is in\ngood agreement with the published value $(3.9 \\pm 0.1) \\times 10^{7}\nM_{\\odot}$, derived from $H_{2}O$-maser observations. Our attempt at measuring\nBH masses in these 3 late type Sbc spiral galaxies has shown that these\nmeasurements are very challenging and at the limit of the highest spatial\nresolution currently available. Nonetheless our estimates are in good agreement\nwith the scaling relations between black holes and their host spheroids\nsuggesting that (i) they are reliable and (ii) black holes in spiral galaxies\nfollows the same scaling relations as those in more massive early-type\ngalaxies. A crucial test for the gas kinematical method, the correct recovery\nof the known BH mass in NGC 4258, has been successful.

By considering the conductance of the chain we show\nthat there exist subgraphs with holes for which the chain will always take an\nexponential amount of time to converge. Finally, as an additional justification\nfor studying a Markov chain on the set of Eulerian orientations of planar\ngraphs, we show that the problem of counting Eulerian orientations remains\n#P-complete when restricted to planar graphs.\n  A preliminary version of this work appeared as an extended abstract in the\n2nd Algorithms and Complexity in Durham workshop.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Mar 2007 12:34:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Using a very simple model with\nbottom-up majority rule voting, the dynamics of power distribution at the\nvarious hierarchical levels is calculated within a probabilistic framework.\nGiven a leadership at the top, the opposition weight from the hierarchy bottom\nis shown to fall off quickly while climbing up the hierarchy. It reaches zero\nafter only a few hierarchical levels. Indeed the voting process is found to\nobey a threshold dynamics with a deterministic top outcome. Accordingly the\nleadership may stay stable against very large amplitude increases in the\nopposition at the bottom level.

The new method improves on it by taking into account the full\nspatial inertia tensor of each cluster, in order to partition the dataset into\nfault-like, anisotropic clusters. Given a catalog of seismic events, the output\nis the optimal set of plane segments that fits the spatial structure of the\ndata.

The main tunable parameter is the accuracy of the earthquake\nlocalizations, which fixes the resolution, i.e. the residual variance of the\nfit. The resolution determines the number of fault segments needed to describe\nthe earthquake catalog, the better the resolution, the finer the structure of\nthe reconstructed fault segments.

If a system may be in any one of two pure states x and y, we\nmust consider that it may also be in any one of many superpositions of x and y.\nAn in-depth analysis of superpositions is proposed, in which states are\nrepresented by one-dimensional subspaces, not by unit vectors as in Dirac's\nnotation. Superpositions must be considered when one cannot distinguish between\npossible paths, i.e., histories, leading to the current state of the system. In\nsuch a case the resulting state is some compound of the states that result from\neach of the possible paths. States can be compounded, i.e., superposed in such\na way only if they are not orthogonal. Since different classical states are\northogonal, the claim implies no non-trivial superpositions can be observed in\nclassical systems. The parameter that defines such compounds is a proportion\ndefining the mix of the different states entering the compound. Two quantities,\np and theta, both geometrical in nature, relate one-dimensional subspaces in\ncomplex Hilbert spaces: the first one is a measure of proximity relating two\nrays, the second one is an angle relating three rays. The properties of the\noperation of superposition are very different from those that govern linear\ncombination of vectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Mar 2007 13:52:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2007 13:05:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-07"}
