Our results also show SZ decrements around APM and 2MASS\ngroups at increased significance than previously detected. We then follow the\napproach of Lieu et al 2006 and compare the stacked WMAP results for the\ndecrement in 31 clusters with ROSAT X-ray profiles where Lieu et al found on\naverage less SZ decrement in the WMAP 1 year data than predicted. We confirm\nthat in the 3 year data these same clusters again show less SZ decrement than\nthe X-ray data predicts. We then analysed the WMAP results for the 38 X-ray\nclusters with OVRO/BIMA measured SZ decrements as presented by Bonamente et al\n2006. We again find that the average decrement is measured to be significantly\nless (5.5 sigma) than predicted by the Chandra X-ray data. Thus while we\nconfirm the original detection of an extended SZ effect by Myers et al 2004,\nthese X-ray comparisons may now suggest that the central SZ amplitudes detected\nby WMAP may actually be lower than expected. One possible explanation is that\nthere is contamination of the WMAP SZ signal by radio sources in the clusters\nbut we argue that this appears implausible. We then consider the possibility\nthat the SZ decrement has been lensed away by foreground galaxy groups. Such a\nmodel predicts that the SZ decrement should depend on cluster redshift. A\nreduction in the SZ decrement with redshift is suggested from the ACO cluster\nsample and also from comparing the samples of Lieu et al 2006 and Bonamente et\nal 06. However, the mass power-spectrum would require a far higher amplitude\nthan currently expected if lensing was to explain the SZ deficit in high\nredshift clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Mar 2007 18:01:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2007 11:54:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The variance of the\ndisplacement of the tagged particle, averaged with respect to an initial\nstationary ensemble and stochastic evolution, grows linearly with time at both\nsmall and very large times. We find that at intermediate times, it shows\noscillations with a well defined size-dependent period.

Indeed, that period length increases linearly with $n$, that\nis: in arithmetic progression. The fields have regulator $O(n^2)$. In the late\nnineties, these matters intrigued Irving Kaplansky, and led him to compute\nperiod length of the square root of sequences $a^2x^{2n}+bx^{n}+c$ for integers\n$a$, $b$, $c$, and $x$. In brief, Kap found unsurprisingly that, generically,\ntriples $(a,b,c)$ are `leapers': they yield sequences with period length\nincreasing at exponential rate. But there are triples yielding sequences with\nconstant period length, Kap's `sleepers'. Finally, there are triples, as\nexemplified by the Shanks's sequence, for which the period lengths increase in\narithmetic progression. Felicitously, Kaplansky called these `creepers'. It\nseems that the sleepers and creepers are precisely those for which one is able\nto detail the explicit continued fraction expansion for all $n$. Inter alia,\nthis thesis noticeably extends the known classes of creepers and finds that not\nall are `kreepers' (of the shape identified by Kaplansky) and therefore not of\nthe shape of examples studied by earlier authors looking for families of\nquadratic number fields with explicitly computable unit and of relatively large\nregulator.

I show\nthat even imperfect copying essential in such situations restricts possible\nunperturbed outcomes to an orthogonal subset of all possible states of the\nsystem, thus breaking the unitary symmetry of its Hilbert space implied by the\nquantum superposition principle. Preferred outcome states emerge as a result.\nThey provide framework for the ``wavepacket collapse'', designating terminal\npoints of quantum jumps, and defining the measured observable by specifying its\neigenstates. In quantum Darwinism, they are the progenitors of multiple copies\nspread throughout the environment -- the fittest quantum states that not only\nsurvive decoherence, but subvert it into carrying information about them --\ninto becoming a witness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Mar 2007 16:17:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2007 04:58:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Mar 2008 16:43:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
