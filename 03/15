A Bayesian method, implemented in the Im2shape\nsoftware, is used to fit the shape parameters of the faint background galaxies\nand to correct for PSF smearing. With the present data, shear profiles are\nmeasured in all clusters out to at least 2 Mpc (more than 15arcmin from the\ncenter) with high confidence. The radial shear profiles are fitted with\ndifferent parametric mass profiles and the virial mass M_200 is estimated for\neach cluster and then compared to other physical properties.\n  Results: Scaling relations between mass and optical luminosity indicate an\nincrease of the M/L ratio with luminosity and a L_X-M_200 relation scaling as\nL_X \\propto M_200^(0.83 +/- 0.11) while the normalization of the M_200 \\propto\nT_X^{3/2} relation is close to the one expected from hydrodynamical simulations\nof cluster formation as well as previous X-ray analyses. We suggest that the\ndispersion in the M_200-T_X and M_200-L_X relations reflects the different\nmerging and dynamical histories for clusters of similar X-ray luminosities and\nintrinsic variations in their measured masses. Improved statistics of clusters\nover a wider mass range are required for a better control of the intrinsic\nscatter in scaling relations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2007 13:53:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 May 2007 15:48:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Given a certain\nphysical system, it is of interest to understand which properties of the system\naccount for the presence of a phase transition, and an understanding of these\nproperties may lead to a deeper understanding of the physical phenomenon. One\npossible approach of this issue, reviewed and discussed in the present paper,\nis the study of topology changes in configuration space which, remarkably, are\nfound to be related to equilibrium phase transitions in classical statistical\nmechanical systems. For the study of configuration space topology, one\nconsiders the subsets M_v, consisting of all points from configuration space\nwith a potential energy per particle equal to or less than a given v. For\nfinite systems, topology changes of M_v are intimately related to nonanalytic\npoints of the microcanonical entropy (which, as a surprise to many, do exist).\nIn the thermodynamic limit, a more complex relation between nonanalytic points\nof thermodynamic functions (i.e., phase transitions) and topology changes is\nobserved. For some class of short-range systems, a topology change of the M_v\nat v=v_t was proved to be necessary for a phase transition to take place at a\npotential energy v_t. In contrast, phase transitions in systems with long-range\ninteractions or in systems with non-confining potentials need not be\naccompanied by such a topology change. Instead, for such systems the\nnonanalytic point in a thermodynamic function is found to have some\nmaximization procedure at its origin.

A particular feature is that the diffusion\nmatrix of this process is a linear function the law of the process, and not a\nquadratic one, as in the McKean-Vlasov model. The main goal of the paper is to\nconstruct an easily simulable diffusive interacting particle system, converging\ntowards this nonlinear process and to obtain an explicit pathwise rate.\n  This requires to find a significant coupling between finitely many Brownian\nmotions and the infinite dimensional white noise process. The key idea will be\nto construct the right Brownian motions by pushing forward the white noise\nprocesses, through the Brenier map realizing the optimal transport between the\nlaw of the nonlinear process, and the empirical measure of independent copies\nof it. A striking problem then is to establish the joint measurability of this\noptimal transport map with respect to the space variable and the parameters\n(time and randomness) making the marginals vary.

The present paper aims\nto assess the innate immune response in fasting eiders in relation to their\ninitial body condition. Innate immunity was assessed by measuring plasma nitric\noxide (NO) levels, prior to and after injection of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a\nmethod which is easily applicable to many wild animals. Body condition index\nand corticosterone levels were subsequently determined as indicators of body\ncondition and stress level prior to LPS injection. The innate immune response\nin eiders did not vary significantly throughout the incubation period. The\ninnate immune response of eiders did not vary significantly in relation to\ntheir initial body condition but decreased significantly when corticosterone\nlevels increased. However, NO levels after LPS injection were significantly and\npositively related to initial body condition, while there was a significant\nnegative relationship with plasma corticosterone levels. Our study suggests\nthat female eiders preserve an effective innate immune response during\nincubation and this response might be partially determined by the initial body\ncondition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2007 12:44:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this paper, we fill in this important gap by\nproposing such a model and a post-processing protocol for the entanglement PDC\nQKD. Although the PDC model is proposed to study the entanglement-based QKD, we\nemphasize that our generic model may also be useful for other non-QKD\nexperiments involving a PDC source. Since an entangled PDC source is a basis\nindependent source, we apply Koashi-Preskill's security analysis to the\nentanglement PDC QKD.

The simulation result suggests that the entanglement PDC QKD can tolerate\nhigher channel losses than the coherent state QKD. The coherent state QKD with\ndecoy states is able to achieve highest key rate in the low and medium-loss\nregions. By applying Gottesman-Lo two-way post-processing protocol, the\nentanglement PDC QKD can tolerate up to 70dB combined channel losses (35dB for\neach channel) provided that the PDC source is placed in between Alice and Bob.\nAfter considering statistical fluctuations, the PDC setup can tolerate up to\n53dB channel losses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2007 19:19:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-12"}
