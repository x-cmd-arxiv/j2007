We show that the low polarization is the apparent result\nof depolarization by gas contamination at low dust concentration, which, in\nturn, results from the dust in type I comets being concentrated near the\nnucleus. The simulations of thermal emission show that for more porous\nparticles (BCCA), the silicate feature is more pronounced than more compact\nones (BPCA), for which it even vanishes as the particles become larger. We also\nshow that in both types of comets the main contribution to light scattering and\nemission comes from particles larger than 10 micron. Conclusions: .The strength\nof the silicate feature in the cometary infrared spectra suggests that the dust\nin type II comets consists of high-porosity aggregates, whereas the dust of\ntype I comets contains low-porosity ones. This is consistent with the\npolarimetric features of these comets, which indicate that the dust in type I\ncomets tends to concentrate near the nucleus. This may result from the\npredominance of highly processed particles in type I comets, whereas in type II\ncomets we see pristine or slightly-processed dust. This conclusion is in\naccordance with the orbital characteristics of the comets. We have found that\nthe strength of the silicate feature correlates with the semi-major axis of\nperiodic comets and, for short-period comets, with the perihelion distance.\nThus, the silicate feature weakens due to compaction of aggregate particles if\na comet spends more time in the vicinity of the Sun, which allows the comet to\naccumulate a mantle on the surface of its nucleus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2007 20:41:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The local studies of an algebraic Lie algebra $\\g=\\mathrm{R}\\ltimes\\n$\nin $\\L_m$ and its nilpotent part $\\n$ in the scheme $\\L_n^{\\mathrm{R}}$ of\n$\\mathrm{R}$-invariant Lie algebras on $\\K^n$ are linked. This comparison is\nmade by means of slices, which are transversal subschemes to the orbits of $\\g$\nand $\\n$ under the classical groups acting on $\\L_m$ and $\\L_n^{\\mathrm{R}}$\nrespectively. We prove a reduction theorem saying that, under certain\nconditions on $\\g$, the local rings of the slices at $\\g$ and $\\n$ are\nisomorphic. In particular, $\\g$ is rigid if and only if is $\\n$. In the\nformalism developed at beginning of this paper, a deformation of $\\g$ with base\na local ring $\\A$ is a local morphism from the local ring of $\\L_m$ at $\\g$ to\n$\\A$. So the study of deformations for a large class of Lie algebras $\\g$ in\n$\\L_m$ is equivalent to that of $\\n$ in $\\L_n^{\\mathrm{R}}$ \"modulo\" the\nactions of groups, which is a more simple problem. The laws of\n$\\L_n^{\\mathrm{R}}$ are nilpotent with the choice of $\\mathrm{R}$ and then we\ncan construct these laws by central extensions. This corresponds to an\ninduction on the schemes themselves\n$\\L_n^{\\mathrm{R}}\\to\\L_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{R}}$. We restrict this study to a torus\n$\\mathrm{R}=\\mathrm{T}$ for certain slices. This leads to a concept of\ncontinuous families with the possibility to have nilpotent parameters $t$ (the\nschemes are generally not reduced). This gives an alternative formalism for the\nproblem of obstructions classes in the theory of formal deformations of\nM.Gerstenhaber.

High-fidelity\nsingle-qubit operations are performed deterministically within a\ndecoherence-free subsystem without leakage via global addressing of bichromatic\nlaser fields. Two-qubit operations are realized locally with four physical\nqubits, and between separated logical qubits using linear optics. We show how\nto prepare cluster states using this method. We include all\nnon-nearest-neighbor effects in our calculations, and we assume the qubits are\nnot located in the Dicke limit. Although our proposal is general to any system\nof dipole-coupled qubits, throughout the paper we use nitrogen-vacancy (NV)\ncenters in diamond as an experimental context for our theoretical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2007 22:24:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We prove\nthat the minimum circuit size that simulates $U$ is in linear relation with the\ngeodesic length and simulation parameters, for the given Finsler structure $F$.\nAs a corollary we prove the highest lower bound of $O(\\frac{%\nn^{4}}{p}d_{F_{p}}^{2}(I,U)L_{F_{p}}(I,\\tilde{U})) $and the lowest upper bound\nof $\\Omega (n^{4}d_{F_{p}}^{3}(I,U))$, for the standard simulation technique.\nTherefore, our results show that by standard simulation one can not expect a\nbetter then $n^{2}$ times improvement in the upper bound over the result from\nNielsen, Dowling, Gu and Doherty \\cite{Nielsen06}. Moreover, our equivalence\nresult can be applied to the arbitrary path on the manifold including the one\nthat is generated adiabatically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2007 21:23:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-19"}
