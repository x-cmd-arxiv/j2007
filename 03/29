This results in off-energy-shell scatterings modifying the free-space\nNN-interaction by a dispersion correction. This is a major contribution to the\ndensity-dependence of the effective in-medium force and to saturation.\nLow-momentum effective interactions have been derived by renormalisation\nmethods whereby correlations may be reduced by effectively cutting off high\nmomentum components of the interaction. The effect of these cut-offs on\ndispersive corrections and on saturation is the main focus of this paper. The\nrole of the tensor-force, its strength and its effect on correlations is of\nparticular interest. The importance of the definition of the mean field in\ndetermining saturation as well as compressibility is also pointed out.\n  With a cut-off below $\\sim 2.6 fm^{-1}$ there is no saturation but at lower\ndensity the binding energy is still well approximated suggesting that such a\nforce may be useful in nuclear structure calculations of (small) finite nuclei\nif saturation is not an issue.\n  A separable interaction that fits experimental phase-shifts exactly by\ninverse scattering methods is used.
