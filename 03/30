We\nquantify the impact of baryonic physics using a set of three cosmological\nnumerical simulations. Each simulation has the same initial density field, but\nmodels a different set of physical processes. The first simulation evolves the\ndensity field using gravity alone, the second includes non-radiative\ngasdynamics, and the third includes radiative heating and cooling of baryons,\nstar formation, and supernova feedback. We find that baryonic processes alter\npredictions for the matter power spectrum significantly relative to models that\ninclude only gravitational interactions. Our results imply that future weak\nlensing experiments such as LSST and SNAP will be very sensitive to the\npoorly-understood physics governing the nonlinear evolution of the baryonic\ncomponent of the universe. The net effect is significantly larger in the case\nof the model with cooling and star formation, in which case our results imply\nthat contemporary surveys such as the CFHT Wide survey may also be sensitive to\nbaryonic processes. In particular, this effect could be important for forecasts\nof the constraining power of future surveys if information from scales larger\nthan l ~ 1000 is included in the analysis. We find that deviations are caused\nprimarily by the rearrangement of matter within individual dark matter halos\nrelative to the gravity-only case, rather than a large-scale rearrangement of\nmatter. Consequently, we propose a simple model, based on the phenomenological\nhalo model of dark matter clustering, for baryonic effects that can be used to\naid in the interpretation of forthcoming weak lensing data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Mar 2007 19:18:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We perform MHD simulations of fossil bubbles in the\npresence of tangled magnetic fields using the high order PENCIL code. We focus\non the physically-motivated case where thermal pressure dominates over magnetic\npressure and consider randomly oriented fields with and without maximum\nhelicity and a case where large scale external fields drape the bubble.We find\nthat helicity has some stabilizing effect. However, unless the coherence length\nof magnetic fields exceeds the bubble size, the bubbles are quickly shredded.\nAs observations of Hydra A suggest that lengthscale of magnetic fields may be\nsmaller then typical bubble size, this may suggest that other mechanisms, such\nas viscosity, may be responsible for stabilizing the bubbles. However, since\nFaraday rotation observations of radio lobes do not constrain large scale ICM\nfields well if they are aligned with the bubble surface, the draping case may\nbe a viable alternative solution to the problem.

As opposed to nature, man-made systems are in most cases not inherently\nrobust and a significant effort has to be made in order to make them resistant\nagainst failures. This can be done in a wide variety of ways and on various\nsystem levels. In the field of digital systems, for example, techniques such as\ntriple modular redundancy (TMR) are frequently used, which results in a\nconsiderable hardware overhead. Biologically-inspired computing by means of\nbio-chemical metaphors offers alternative paradigms, which need to be explored\nand evaluated.\n  Here, we are interested to evaluate the potential of nature-inspired\nartificial chemistries and membrane systems as an alternative information\nrepresenting and processing paradigm in order to obtain robust and spatially\nextended Boolean computing systems in a distributed environment. We investigate\nconceptual approaches inspired by artificial chemistries and membrane systems\nand compare proof-of-concepts. First, we show, that elementary logical\nfunctions can be implemented. Second, we illustrate how they can be made more\nrobust and how they can be assembled to larger-scale systems. Finally, we\ndiscuss the implications for and paths to possible genuine implementations.\nCompared to the main body of work in artificial chemistries, we take a very\npragmatic and implementation-oriented approach and are interested in realizing\nBoolean computations only. The results emphasize that artificial chemistries\ncan be used to implement Boolean logic in a spatially extended and distributed\nenvironment and can also be made highly robust, but at a significant price.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Mar 2007 20:57:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

Reassignment events can be\nclassified according to the gain-loss framework. The gain represents the\nappearance of a new tRNA for the reassigned codon or the change of an existing\ntRNA such that it gains the ability to pair with the codon. The loss represents\nthe deletion of a tRNA or the change in a tRNA so that it no longer translates\nthe codon. One possible mechanism is Codon Disappearance, where the codon\ndisappears from the genome prior to the gain and loss events. In the\nalternative mechanisms the codon does not disappear. In the Unassigned Codon\nmechanism, the loss occurs first, whereas in the Ambiguous Intermediate\nmechanism, the gain occurs first. Codon usage analysis gives clear evidence of\ncases where the codon disappeared at the point of the reassignment and also\ncases where it did not disappear. Codon disappearance is the probable\nexplanation for stop to sense reassignments and a small number of reassignments\nof sense codons. However, the majority of sense to sense reassignments cannot\nbe explained by codon disappearance. In the latter cases, by analysis of the\npresence or absence of tRNAs in the genome and of the changes in tRNA\nsequences, it is sometimes possible to distinguish between the Unassigned Codon\nand Ambiguous Intermediate mechanisms. We emphasize that not all reassignments\nfollow the same scenario and that it is necessary to consider the details of\neach case carefully.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Mar 2007 10:09:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-17"}
