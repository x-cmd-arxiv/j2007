In fact, the\nonly possible synthesis of this species appears to be production on the\nsurfaces of dust grains followed by desorption into the gas. Yet, evaporation\nis inefficient for heavy molecules such as methanol at the typical temperature\nof 10 K. It is necessary then to consider non-thermal mechanisms for\ndesorption. But, if such mechanisms are considered for the production of\nmethanol, they must be considered for all surface species. Methods: Our\ngas-grain network of reactions has been altered by the inclusion of a\nnon-thermal desorption mechanism in which the exothermicity of surface addition\nreactions is utilized to break the bond between the product species and the\nsurface. Our estimated rate for this process derives from a simple version of\nclassical unimolecular rate theory with a variable parameter only loosely\ncontrained by theoretical work. Results: Our results show that the chemistry of\ndark clouds is altered slightly at times up to 10^6 yr, mainly by the\nenhancement in the gas-phase abundances of hydrogen-rich species such as\nmethanol that are formed on grain surfaces. At later times, however, there is a\nrather strong change. Instead of the continuing accretion of most gas-phase\nspecies onto dust particles, a steady-state is reached for both gas-phase and\ngrain-surface species, with significant abundances for the former.\nNevertheless, most of the carbon is contained in an undetermined assortment of\nheavy surface hydrocarbons.

Using two over-simplified examples (the\nDirac-Coulomb and Dirac-oscillator fields), we report energy-levels crossing as\na spectral property or as an effect of the hidden supersymmetric quantum\nmechanical language and/or quasi-parity signatures. Under different settings of\nthe related interactions' way-of-coupling into Dirac equation, it is observed\nthat the two ultimate/effective descendents, Dirac-Coulomb and\nDirac-oscillator, exhibit different conditions on the energy-levels crossings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2007 12:01:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Apr 2007 09:08:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2007 07:47:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-04"}
