Based on stellar evolutionary models and the bimodal\ncolors and metallicities of Galactic GCs this is thought to reflect an\nunderlying bimodal metallicity distribution. However, stars at many different\nphases of stellar evolution contribute to optical light. The I-H color is a\nmuch cleaner tracer of metallicity because it primarily samples the metallicity\nsensitive giant branch. Therefore, we use deep HST-NICMOS H, and WFPC2 optical\nobservations, of M87 GCs to study their metallicity distribution. The M87\nclusters are bimodal in I-H, for which there is no known physical explanation\nother than a bimodal metallicity distribution. Moreover, the two modes defined\nby the B-I and I-H colors are comprised of roughly the same two sets of\nobjects, confirming that optical colors also primarily trace the metallicity.\nThis is inconsistent with a recent suggestion based on one model of metallicity\neffects on the horizontal branch that bimodality arises from an underlying\nunimodal metallicity distribution due to a specific color-metallicity relation.\nWe also find no discernable variation in the peak colors of the M87 GCs out to\nroughly 75 kpc due to the declining ratio of red-to-blue GCs, as implied by\nthis model. Similarly, there is no evidence that the bimodal peaks are bluer\nfor systems with large blue-to-red GC ratio. Our observations confirm that the\nprimary cause of bimodality in cluster systems is an underlying bimodal\nmetallicity distribution, and not the specific color-metallicity relationship\ndefined by this horizontal branch model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2007 19:10:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2007 16:14:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The aim of this new line list is to allow significant\nimprovements in the quality of wavelength calibration for medium- to\nhigh-resolution astronomical spectrographs. Methods. We use a series of ThAr\nlamp exposures obtained with the HARPS instrument (High Accuracy\nRadial-velocity Planet Searcher) to detect previously unknown lines, perform a\nsystematic search for blended lines and correct individual wavelengths by\ndetermining the systematic offset of each line relative to the average\nwavelength solution. Results. We give updated wavelengths for more than 8400\nlines over the spectral range 3785-6915 A. The typical internal uncertainty on\nthe line positions is estimated to be ~10 m/s (3.3 parts in 10^8 or 0.18 mA),\nwhich is a factor of 2-10 better than the widely used Los Alamos Atlas of the\nThorium Spectrum (Palmer & Engleman 1983). The absolute accuracy of the global\nwavelength scale is the same as in the Los Alamos Atlas. Using this new line\nlist on HARPS ThAr spectra, we are able to obtain a global wavelength\ncalibration which is precise at the 20 cm/s level (6.7 parts in 10^10 or 0.0037\nmA). Conclusions. Several research fields in astronomy requiring high-precision\nwavelength calibration in the visible (e.g. radial velocity planet searches,\nvariability of fundamental constants) should benefit from using the new line\nlist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2007 19:13:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

It has been suggested that these planets are in a\nresonance involving persistent misalignment and synchronous precession of their\nspin and orbital angular momenta, a Cassini state, and that the attendant tidal\nheating inflates the planet. We argue against this. Using explicit tidal\nintegrations, we show that although an oblique Cassini state can dissipate many\ntimes the rotational energy of the planet, the rate of dissipation must be much\nless than hypothesized. Dissipation causes the planetary spin to lie at an\nangle to the plane containing the orbital and total angular momenta. If\ndissipation is too rapid, this angle becomes so large that Cassini equilibrium\nis lost. A separate consideration limits the total energy that can be extracted\nfrom the orbit. The source of the torque on the orbit, either an oblique parent\nstar or an inclined third body, aligns with the orbit as it absorbs the angular\nmomentum shed by the planet. Alignment removes the orbital precession required\nby the Cassini state. In combination with observational bounds on the mass and\nsemimajor axis of a possible second planet and with bounds on the stellar\nrotation and obliquity, these constraints make it very unlikely that obliquity\ntides can be the explanation for inflated hot Jupiters, especially HD 209458b.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2007 13:53:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

In particular, it has\nbeen shown that low frequency Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO) frequency -\nphoton index correlation curves have a specific pattern. In a number of sources\nthe shape of the index-low frequency QPO correlations are self-similar with a\nposition offset in the QPO frequency-Gamma plane. Titarchuk & Fiorito presented\nstrong theoretical and observational arguments that the QPO frequency values in\nthis QPO frequency-Gamma correlation should be inversely proportional to\nM_{BH}. A simple translation of the correlation for a given source along the\nfrequency axis leads to the observed correlation for another source. As a\nresult of this translation one can obtain a scaling factor which is simply a BH\nmass ratio for these particular sources. This property of the correlations\noffers a fundamentally new method for BH mass determination in XRBs. Here we\nuse the observed QPO-index correlations observed in three BH sources: GRO\nJ1655-40, GRS 1915+105 and Cyg X-1. The BH mass of (6.3 +/- 0.5) M_Sun in GRO\nJ1655-40 is obtained using optical observations. RXTE observations during the\nrecent 2005 outburst yielded sufficient data to establish the correlation\npattern during both rise and decay of the event. We use GRO J1655-40 as a\nstandard reference source to measure the BH mass in Cyg X-1. We also revisit\nthe GRS 1915+105 data as a further test of our scaling method. We infer the\nvalue of BH mass of (15.6 +/- 1.5) M_Sun in this source which is consistent\nwith the previous BH mass estimate in GRS 1915 of (13.3 +/- 4) M_Sun. We obtain\nthe BH mass in Cyg X-1 in the range (8.7 +/- 0.8) M_Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2007 14:55:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

Both versions of the see-saw mechanism explain naturally small\nneutrino masses, but the type II scenario offers interesting additional\npossibilities to explain large or almost maximal or vanishing mixings which are\ndiscussed in this paper. We first introduce ``type II enhancement'' of neutrino\nmixing, where moderate cancellations between the two terms can lead to large\nneutrino mixing even if all individual mass matrices and terms generate small\nmixing. However, nearly maximal or vanishing mixings are not naturally\nexplained in this way, unless there is a certain initial structure (symmetry)\nwhich enforces certain elements of the matrices to be identical or related in a\nspecial way. We therefore assume that the leading structure of the neutrino\nmass matrix is the triplet term and corresponds to zero U_{e3} and maximal\ntheta_{23}. Small but necessary corrections are generated by the conventional\nsee-saw term. Then we assume that one of the two terms corresponds to an\nextreme mixing scenario, such as bimaximal or tri-bimaximal mixing. Deviations\nfrom this scheme are introduced by the second term. One can mimic Quark-Lepton\nComplementarity in this way. Finally, we note that the neutrino mass matrix for\ntri-bimaximal mixing can be -- depending on the mass hierarchy -- written as a\nsum of two terms with simple structure.

The measurement of the charge-qubit states can be used to\ndemonstrate the statistical properties of photons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2007 13:24:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The tunneling time can be calculated from the\nquasi-energy splitting of the corresponding Floquet states. By varying the\nkick-strength these quasi-energy levels undergo both avoided and even actual\ncrossings.

A quantum version of standard (classical) dissipativity\nresults are presented and from this a quantum version of the Strict Bounded\nReal Lemma is derived. This enables a quantum version of the two Riccati\nsolution to the H-infinity control problem to be presented. This result leads\nto controllers which may be realized using purely quantum, purely classical or\na mixture of quantum and classical elements. This issue of physical\nrealizability of the controller is examined in detail, and necessary and\nsufficient conditions are given.
