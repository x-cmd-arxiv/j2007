This setting,\nalso referred to as the question of the compatibility of local spectra, has\nseveral applications in quantum information theory. Here, we introduce the\nanalogue of this statement for Gaussian states for any number of modes, and\nsolve it in generality, for pure and mixed states, both concerning necessary\nand sufficient conditions. Formally, our result can be viewed as an analogue of\nthe Sing-Thompson Theorem (respectively Horn's Lemma), characterizing the\nrelationship between main diagonal elements and singular values of a complex\nmatrix: We find necessary and sufficient conditions for vectors (d1, ..., dn)\nand (c1, ..., cn) to be the symplectic eigenvalues and symplectic main diagonal\nelements of a strictly positive real matrix, respectively. More physically\nspeaking, this result determines what local temperatures or entropies are\nconsistent with a pure or mixed Gaussian state of several modes. We find that\nthis result implies a solution to the problem of sharing of entanglement in\npure Gaussian states and allows for estimating the global entropy of\nnon-Gaussian states based on local measurements. Implications to the actual\npreparation of multi-mode continuous-variable entangled states are discussed.\nWe compare the findings with the marginal problem for qubits, the solution of\nwhich for pure states has a strikingly similar and in fact simple form.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Mar 2007 11:15:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2007 10:13:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-22"}
