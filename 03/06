It is important to quantify these effects in order to\nunderstand the errors in shape measurements of astronomical objects, such as\nthose used to study weak gravitational lensing of field galaxies. The PSF\nmodeling involves either a Fourier transform of the phase information in the\npupil plane or a ray-tracing approach, which has the advantage of requiring\nfewer computations than the Fourier transform. Using a standard method,\ninvolving the Gaussian weighted second moments of intensity, we then calculate\nthe ellipticity of the PSF patterns. We find significant ellipticity for the\ninstantaneous patterns (up to more than 10%). Longer exposures, which we\napproximate by combining multiple (N) images from uncorrelated atmospheric\nrealizations, yield progressively lower ellipticity (as 1 / sqrt(N)). We also\nverify that the measured ellipticity does not depend on the sampling interval\nin the pupil plane using the Fourier method. However, we find that the results\nusing the ray-tracing technique do depend on the pupil sampling interval,\nrepresenting a gradual breakdown of the geometric approximation at high spatial\nfrequencies. Therefore, ray tracing is generally not an accurate method of\nmodeling PSF ellipticity induced by atmospheric turbulence unless some\nadditional procedure is implemented to correctly account for the effects of\nhigh spatial frequency aberrations.

Aims: We advocate a new model for the formation of brown dwarfs.\nMethods: In this model, brown dwarfs are initially binary companions, formed by\ngravitational fragmentation of the outer parts (R > 100 AU) of protostellar\ndiscs around low-mass hydrogen-burning stars. Most of these binaries are then\ngently disrupted by passing stars to create a largely single population of\nbrown dwarfs and low-mass hydrogen-burning stars. Results: This idea is\nconsistent with the excess of binaries found in low-density pre-main sequence\npopulations, like that in Taurus, where they should survive longer than in\ndenser clusters. Conclusions: If brown dwarfs form in this way, as companions\nto more massive stars, the difficulty of forming very low-mass prestellar cores\nis avoided. Since the disrupted binaries will tend to be those involving\nlow-mass components and wide orbits, and since disruption will be due to the\ngentle tides of passing stars (rather than violent N-body interactions in\nsmall-N sub-clusters), the liberated brown dwarfs will have velocity\ndispersions and spatial distributions very similar to higher-mass stars, and\nthey will be able to retain discs, and thereby to sustain accretion and\noutflows. Thus the problems associated with the ejection and turbulence\nmechanisms can be avoided. This model implies that most, possibly all, stars\nand brown dwarfs form in binary or multiple systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2007 09:16:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

At the latter epoch spectropolarimetry was also\nattempted, yielding an upper limit of ~ 2% for the polarization. The spectra\nshow strong emission lines of [OI] and MgI], as expected from a Type Ic\nsupernova, but weak CaII lines. The [FeII] lines that were strong in the\nspectra of SN 1998bw are much weaker in SN 2006aj, consistent with the lower\nluminosity of this SN. The outer velocity of the line-emitting ejecta is ~ 8000\nkm/s in July and ~ 7400 km/s in September, consistent with the relatively low\nkinetic energy of expansion of SN 2006aj. All emission lines have similar\nwidth, and the profiles are symmetric, indicating that no major asymmetries are\npresent in the ejecta at the velocities sampled by the nebular lines (v < 8000\nkm/s), except perhaps in the innermost part. The spectra were modelled with a\nnon-LTE code. The mass of 56Ni required to power the emission spectrum is ~\n0.20 Msun, in excellent agreement with the results of early light curve\nmodelling. The oxygen mass is ~ 1.5 Msun, again much less than in SN 1998bw but\nlarger by ~ 0.7 Msun than the value derived from the early-time modelling. The\ntotal ejected mass is ~ 2 Msun below 8000 km/s. This confirms that SN 2006aj\nwas only slightly more massive and energetic than the prototypical Type Ic SN\n1994I, but also indicates the presence of a dense inner core, containing ~ 1\nMsun of mostly oxygen and carbon. The presence of such a core is inferred for\nall broad-lined SNe Ic. This core may have the form of an equatorial\noxygen-dominated region, but it is too deep to affect the early light curve and\ntoo small to affect the late polarization spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2007 09:46:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

However, difficulties in calibrating the relation between the\ncluster observable and halo mass, and the lack of completeness information,\nmake this technique particularly susceptible to systematic errors. Here we\nargue that a cluster abundance analysis using statistical weak lensing on the\nstacked clusters leads to a robust lower limit on the amplitude of\nfluctuations. The method compares the average weak lensing signal measured\naround the whole cluster sample to a theoretical prediction, assuming that the\nclusters occupy the centers of all of the most massive halos above some minimum\nmass threshold. If the amplitude of fluctuations is below a certain limiting\nvalue, there are too few massive clusters in this model and the theoretical\nprediction falls below the observations.

This work lays out a\ntheoretical and computational microscopic framework for the study of a wide\nrange of realistic meta-populations models and agent-based models that include\nthe complex features of real world networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2007 17:08:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The investigation relies on several spectroscopic techniques\nused to probe the microscopic damage induced by UV laser on the material. The\nmost innovative approach, however, is the measurement in situ of the absorption\nsignals related to laser-induced point defects. This technique yields new\ninformation on the kinetics of defect processes, inaccessible to previous works\nbased only on stationary measurements of laser-induced damage. The main result\nis to show that a major damage mechanism of silica under 4.7eV laser radiation\nis the generation of E' centers (silicon dangling bond defects) by photolysis\nof pre-existing Si-H bonds. This process occurs by two-photon absorption of\nlaser light, and the produced E' centers are unstable in a wide temperature\nrange: in fact, rupture of Si-H produces hydrogen atoms H together with E';\nhence, H atoms dimerize in H_2, which diffuses in the glass and reacts back\nwith the E' centers causing their decay. The generation and decay kinetics of\nlaser-induced E' centers are quantitatively modelled by considering the\ncompetition between the laser-induced breakage of Si-H and the concurrent\nreaction between E' and H_2. The latter reaction is studied in detail at\nseveral temperatures: some of its features are found to be affected by the\ndisorder of the glass matrix; moreover, its kinetics is found to be\nactivation-limited rather than diffusion-limited, contrary to what is usually\nfound for the reactions of diffusing species with point defects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2007 17:46:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The particle models involve\ntwo types of particles, male and female, and branching can only occur when both\ntypes of particles are present. We show that if the branching rate is\nsufficiently large, this particle model has a nontrivial stationary\ndistribution, i.e. one that does not concentrate all weight on the all-0 state,\nusing a comparison argument due to R. Durrett. We also show extinction for\nsmall branching rates, thereby establishing the existence of a phase\ntransition. We then add two different rapid stirring mechanisms to the\ninteractions and show that for the particle models with rapid stirring, there\nalso exist nontrivial stationary distribution(s); for this, we analyze the\nlimiting PDE and establish a condition on the PDE that guarantees existence of\nnontrivial stationary distributions for sufficient fast stirring.\n  The second problem deals with a model of sympatric speciation, i.e.\nspeciation in the absence of geographical separation, originally proposed by U.\nDieckmann and M. Doebeli in 1999. We modify their original model to obtain\nseveral constant-population particle models.

We give a clear\nrecipe of how to obtain an explicit solution to the radial and angular parts of\nthe wave functions in terms of orthogonal polynomials. The total energy of the\nsystem is different from the pseudo-Coulomb potential because of the\ncontribution of the angular part. The general results obtained in this work can\nbe reduced to the standard forms given in literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2007 06:28:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-15"}
