In this paper we\nconsider the second and third moments of the redshifted 21cm intensity\ndistribution using a simple model that accounts for galaxy bias during the\nreionisation process. We demonstrate that skewness in redshifted 21cm maps\nshould be substantial throughout the reionisation epoch and on all angular\nscales, owing to the effects of galaxy bias which leads to early reionisation\nin over-dense regions of the IGM. The variance (or power-spectrum) of 21cm\nfluctuations will exhibit a minimum in redshift part way through the\nreionisation process, when the global ionisation fraction is around 50%. This\nminimum is generic, and is due to the transition from 21cm intensity being\ndominated by over-dense too under-dense regions as reionisation progresses. We\nshow that the details of the reionisation history, including the presence of\nradiative feedback are encoded in the evolution of the auto-correlation and\nskewness functions with redshift and mean IGM neutral fraction. We discuss the\ndetection of skewness by first generation instruments, and conclude that the\nMileura Widefield Array - Low Frequency Demonstrator will have sufficient\nsensitivity to detect skewness on a range of angular scales at redshifts near\nthe end of reionisation, while a subsequent instrument of 10 times the\ncollecting area could map out the evolution of skewness in detail.

Using the\ndata from all four modules of the InfraRed Spectrograph onboard the Spitzer\nSpace Telescope, we produced a spectral cube ranging from 5 to 35 um for each\none of the observed PDRs. The resulting cubes were analysed using Blind Signal\nSeparation methods (NMF and FastICA). For Ced 201, rho-Ophiuchi West filament\nand NGC 7023 East, we find that two signals can be extracted from the original\ndata cubes, which are 5 to 35 um spectra. The main features of the first\nspectrum are a strong continuum emission at long wavelengths, and a broad 7.8\num band. On the contrary, the second spectrum exhibits the classical Aromatic\nInfrared Bands (AIBs) and no continuum.

The study of the spectral energy distribution of Ced 201 up to 100 um\nsuggests that, in cool PDRs, the 5-25 um continuum is carried by Very Small\nGrains (VSGs).

A notable example\nis digital television. Basically, coding theory is to study a way of detecting\nand/or correcting data that may be true or false. Moreover coding theory is an\narea of mathematics, in which there is an interplay between many branches of\nmathematics, e.g., abstract algebra, combinatorics, discrete geometry,\ninformation theory, etc. In this paper we propose a novel approach for\nanalyzing proof nets of Multiplicative Linear Logic (MLL) by coding theory. We\ndefine families of proof structures and introduce a metric space for each\nfamily. In each family, 1. an MLL proof net is a true code element; 2. a proof\nstructure that is not an MLL proof net is a false (or corrupted) code element.\nThe definition of our metrics reflects the duality of the multiplicative\nconnectives elegantly. In this paper we show that in the framework one\nerror-detecting is possible but one error-correcting not. Our proof of the\nimpossibility of one error-correcting is interesting in the sense that a proof\ntheoretical property is proved using a graph theoretical argument. In addition,\nwe show that affine logic and MLL + MIX are not appropriate for this framework.\nThat explains why MLL is better than such similar logics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2007 07:49:55 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2007 11:48:29 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Fri, 23 May 2008 13:51:28 GMT"},{"version":"v12","created":"Mon, 26 May 2008 11:58:28 GMT"},{"version":"v13","created":"Wed, 28 May 2008 19:46:44 GMT"},{"version":"v14","created":"Thu, 29 May 2008 16:30:06 GMT"},{"version":"v15","created":"Fri, 30 May 2008 09:03:13 GMT"},{"version":"v16","created":"Mon, 2 Jun 2008 08:36:44 GMT"},{"version":"v17","created":"Tue, 3 Jun 2008 04:46:49 GMT"},{"version":"v18","created":"Mon, 9 Jun 2008 12:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v19","created":"Tue, 10 Jun 2008 12:02:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2007 02:36:44 GMT"},{"version":"v20","created":"Sun, 15 Jun 2008 10:13:57 GMT"},{"version":"v21","created":"Wed, 18 Jun 2008 19:27:48 GMT"},{"version":"v22","created":"Sun, 22 Jun 2008 10:18:35 GMT"},{"version":"v23","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2010 11:21:12 GMT"},{"version":"v24","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2010 07:37:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2007 05:42:45 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2007 13:41:04 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2007 08:47:21 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2007 10:22:17 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2007 13:49:06 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2007 07:45:21 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Sat, 18 Aug 2007 08:17:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-06"}

In [2], the scheme is as follows: the pump laser pulse generates a\nlarge amplitude laser wakefield (plasma wave). The counter-propagating\ninjection pulse interferes with the pump laser pulse to generate a beatwave\npattern. The ponderomotive force of the beatwave is able to inject plasma\nelectrons into the wakefield. We have studied this injection scheme using 1D\nParticle in Cell (PIC) simulations. The simulations reveal phenomena and\nimportant physical processes that were not taken into account in previous\nmodels. In particular, at the collision of the laser pulses, most plasma\nelectrons are trapped in the beatwave pattern and cannot contribute to the\ncollective oscillation supporting the plasma wave. At this point, the fluid\napproximation fails and the plasma wake is strongly inhibited.

We address this question using two complementary approaches.\nFirst we study the variance of a real variable associated to the POVM outcomes.\nIn this context we introduce an uncertainty operator which measures how much\nadditional noise is introduced by carrying out a POVM rather than a von Neumann\nmeasurement. We illustrate this first approach by studying the variances of\njoint estimates of \\sigma_x and \\sigma_z for spin 1/2 particles. We show that\nfor unbiased measurements the sum of these variances is lower bounded by 1. In\nour second approach we study the entropy of the POVM outcomes. In particular we\ntry to establish lower bounds on the entropy of the POVM outcomes. We\nillustrate this second approach by examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2007 10:45:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Aug 2007 11:52:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-03"}
