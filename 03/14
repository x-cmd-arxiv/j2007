A number of these\ngalaxies have asymptotic rotation velocities between 250 and 350 km/s making\nthem among the most massive systems (in terms of baryonic mass) considered in\nthe context of MOND. We find that the general MOND prediction for such galaxies\n-- a rotation curve which gradually declines to the asymptotic value -- is\nconfirmed, and in most cases the MOND rotation curve, determined from the mean\nradial light and gas distribution, agrees in detail with the observed rotation\ncurve. In the few cases where MOND appears not to work well, the discrepancies\ncan generally be understood in terms of various observational errors -- such as\nincorrect orientation angles and/or distances -- or of unmodelled physical\neffects -- such as non-circular motions. The implied mass-to-light ratios for\nthe stellar disc and bulge constrain the MOND interpolating function; the form\nrecently suggested by Zhao & Famaey (2005) yields more sensible values than the\none traditionally used in MOND determinations of galaxy rotation curves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2007 10:52:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We have carried out theoretical lattice dynamical calculations which\nreveal that the free energies of the antiferroelectric Pbcm and ferroelectric\nR3c phases are nearly identical over a wide range of temperature. The small\nenergy difference between the two phases is of interest as it explains the\nobserved coexistence of these phases over a wide range of temperature. The\ncomputed double well depths and energy barriers from paraelectric Pm m to\nantiferroelectric Pbcm and ferroelectric R3c phases in NaNbO3 are also quite\nsimilar, although the ferroelectric R3c phase has a slightly lower energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2007 09:13:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-09"}

We study the radial distributions of higher angular\nmomentum states, namely P- and D-wave states, using a \"fuzzy\" static quark. A\nnew improvement is the use of hypercubic blocking in the time direction, which\neffectively constrains the heavy quark to move within a 2a hypercube (a is the\nlattice spacing).\n  The calculation is carried out with dynamical fermions on a 16^3 times 32\nlattice with a lattice spacing approximately 0.10 fm generated using the\nnon-perturbatively improved clover action. The configurations were generated by\nthe UKQCD Collaboration using lattice action parameters beta = 5.2, c_SW =\n2.0171 and kappa = 0.1350.\n  In nature the closest equivalent of this heavy-light system is the B_s meson.\nAttempts are now being made to understand these results in terms of the Dirac\nequation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2007 08:56:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Then, we discuss recent\nrefinements of the criterion as well as geometric type of theorems on the\nsufficiency condition for the regularity of solutions. After that we review\nresults excluding some of the scenarios leading to finite time singularities.\nWe also survey studies of various simplified model problems.\n  A dichotomy type of result between the finite time blow-up and the global in\ntime regular dynamics is presented, and a spectral dynamics approach to study\nlocal in time behaviors of the enstrophy is also reviewed. Finally, progresses\non the problem of optimal regularity for solutions to have conserved quantities\nare presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2007 05:19:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We clarify that the monopole excitation to cluster\nstates is in general strong as to be comparable with the single particle\nstrength and shares an appreciable portion of the sum rule value in spite of\nlarge difference of the structure between the cluster state and the\nshell-model-like ground state. We argue that the essential reasons of the large\nstrength are twofold. One is the fact that the clustering degree of freedom is\npossessed even by simple shell model wave functions. The detailed feature of\nthis fact is described by the so-called Bayman-Bohr theorem which tells us that\nSU(3) shell model wave function is equivalent to cluster model wave function.\nThe other is the ground state correlation induced by the activation of the\ncluster degrees of freedom described by the Bayman-Bohr theorem. We\ndemonstrate, by deriving analytical expressions of monopole matrix elements,\nthat the order of magnitude of the monopole strength is governed by the first\nreason, while the second reason plays a sufficient role in reproducing the data\nup to the factor of magnitude of the monopole strength. Our explanation is made\nby analysing three examples which are the monopole excitations to the $0^+_2$\nand $0^+_3$ states in $^{16}$O and the one to the $0^+_2$ state in $^{12}$C.\nThe present results imply that the measurement of strong monopole transitions\nor excitations is in general very useful for the study of cluster states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2007 15:02:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 Aug 2008 03:07:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-23"}

Experimental validation shows that the complex permeability\nanalytically estimated from the measured $Q$ of a single fabricated\nself-resonant loop agrees with the complex permeability extracted from $S$\nparameter measurements of a metamaterial slab to better than 20%.

In this model, the state and dynamics of a movable\nwall that has the double slits in it, as well as the state of a particle\nincoming to the double slits, are described by quantum mechanics. Using this\nmodel, we analyzed complementarity between exhibiting the interference pattern\nand distinguishing the particle path. Comparing the Kennard-Robertson type and\nthe Ozawa-type uncertainty relations, we conclude that the uncertainty relation\ninvolved in the double-slit experiment is not the Ozawa-type uncertainty\nrelation but the Kennard-type uncertainty relation of the position and the\nmomentum of the double-slit wall. A possible experiment to test the\ncomplementarity relation is suggested. It is also argued that various phenomena\nwhich occur at the interface of a quantum system and a classical system,\nincluding distinguishability, interference, decoherence, quantum eraser, and\nweak value, can be understood as aspects of entanglement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2007 06:21:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2007 03:01:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 Jun 2008 10:58:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2015 09:56:27 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2015 06:28:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-17"}
