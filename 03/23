All stars are assumed to have planetesimal belts with a\ndistribution of initial masses and radii. In the model disk mass is constant\nuntil the largest planetesimals reach collisional equilibrium whereupon the\nmass falls off oc 1/t. We find that the detection statistics and trends seen at\nboth 24 and 70um can be fitted well by the model. While there is no need to\ninvoke stochastic evolution or delayed stirring to explain the statistics, a\nmoderate rate of stochastic events is not ruled out. Potentially anomalous\nsystems are identified by a high dust luminosity compared with the maximum\npermissible in the model (HD3003, HD38678, HD115892, HD172555). Their\nplanetesimals may have unusual properties (high strength or low eccentricity)\nor this dust could be transient. While transient phenomena are also favored for\na few systems in the literature, the overall success of our model, which\nassumes planetesimals in all belts have the same strength, eccentricity and\nmaximum size, suggests a large degree of uniformity in the outcome of planet\nformation. The distribution of planetesimal belt radii, once corrected for\ndetection bias, follows N(r) oc r^{-0.8+-0.3} for 3-120AU. Since the inner edge\nis often attributed to an unseen planet, this provides a unique constraint on\nthe planetary systems of A stars.

We use the replica method to\ncalculate the equilibrium properties of the system. As a function of\ntemperature, we obtain the minimal force at which the molecule separates\ncompletely. This critical force curve is a line in the temperature-force phase\ndiagram that marks the regions where the molecule exists primarily as a helix,\nversus the region where the molecule exists as two separate strands. Near\nmelting, the critical force curve of our random-sequence model is very\ndifferent from that of the homogeneous version of our model. For both sequence\nmodels, the critical force falls to zero at the melting temperature with a\npower law having exponent alpha. For the homogeneous model, alpha is 1/2 almost\nexactly, while for the random model, alpha is about 0.9. The shape of the\ncritical force determines how the helix fraction falls to zero at melting, and\nthus classifies the melting transition as a type of phase transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2007 16:53:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We say the abstract semantics is generic since it is designed to be\ncompletely parametric on the analysis domains: in particular, it provides\nsupport for \\emph{relational} domains (i.e., abstract domains that can capture\nthe relationships between different data objects). We also sketch how the\nproposed methodology can be extended to accommodate a larger language that\nincludes pointers, compound data objects and non-structured control flow\nmechanisms. The approach, which is based on structured, big-step\n$\\mathrm{G}^\\infty\\mathrm{SOS}$ operational semantics and on abstract\ninterpretation, is modular in that the overall static analyzer is naturally\npartitioned into components with clearly identified responsibilities and\ninterfaces, something that greatly simplifies both the proof of correctness and\nthe implementation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2007 09:47:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2007 10:56:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-28"}

For sub-critical tensions, the crossover scale, below which\ngravity may look 4D, and the effective 4D gravitational coupling are sensitive\nto vacuum energy. This shows how the vacuum energy problem manifests in brane\ninduced gravity: instead of tuning the 4D curvature, generically one must tune\nthe crossover scale. On the other hand, in the near-critical limit, branes live\ninside very deep throats which efficiently compactify the angular dimension. In\nthere, 4D gravity first changes to $5D$, and only later to $6D$. The crossover\nscale saturates at the gravitational see-saw scale, independent of the tension.\nUsing the fields of static loops on a wrapped brane, we check the perturbative\ndescription of long range gravity below the crossover scale. In sub-critical\ncases the scalars are strongly coupled already at the crossover scale even in\nthe vacuum, because the brane bending is turned on by the axion flux.

We consider in the present paper two oscillators that should\nexhibit in principle the same property. First, a reflex klystron, a vacuum tube\noperating in the microwave range of frequency. Second a laser involving a\nsingle electron permanently interacting with the field. It is unnecessary to\nquantize the optical field, that is, the theory is semi-classical, yet exact.\nAs an example, the battery-driven one-electron laser delivers a detected noise\nof 7/8 of the shot-noise level, and is therefore sub-Poissonian. Our\ncalculations are related to resonance-fluorescence treatments but with a\ndifferent physical interpretation. Previous theories considering excited-state\natoms regularly-injected in low-loss resonators, on the other hand, do require\nlight quantization. The theory presented here is restricted to above-threshold\nstationary single-mode oscillators. The paper is written in such a way that\nreaders should be able to follow it without having to refer to quantum-optics\ntexts.\"\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2007 07:48:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
