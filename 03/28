Indeed, the global description of the\nconnectivity in the corona requires the use of the photospheric and solar wind\nboundaries. Both are closed surfaces and therefore do not admit a global\nregular system of coordinates. At least two overlapping regular systems of\ncoordinates for each of the boundaries are necessary in this case to avoid\nspherical-pole-like singularities in the coordinates of the footpoints. This\nimplies that the basic characteristic of magnetic connectivity - the squashing\ndegree or factor $Q$ of elemental flux tubes (Titov et al., 2002) - must be\nrewritten in covariant form. Such a covariant expression of $Q$ is derived in\nthis work. The derived expression is very flexible and highly efficient for\ndescribing the global magnetic connectivity in the solar corona.\n  In addition, a general expression for a new characteristic $Q_\\perp$ which\ndefines a squashing of the flux tubes in the directions perpendicular to the\nfield lines is determined. This new quantity makes it possible to filter out\nthe quasi-separatrix layers whose large values of $Q$ are caused by a\nprojection effect at the field lines nearly touching the photosphere. Thus, the\nvalue $Q_\\perp$ provides a much more precise description of the volumetric\nproperties of the magnetic field structure. The difference between $Q$ and\n$Q_\\perp$ is illustrated by comparing their distributions for two\nconfigurations, one of which is the Titov-Demoulin (1999) model of a twisted\nmagnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2007 16:35:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Depending on the model\nparameters and on the initial state, the fault exhibits aftershocks, slow\nearthquakes, or decaying afterslip. We found several regimes with slip rate\ndecaying as a power-law of time, with different characteristic times and\nexponents. The complexity of the model makes it unrealistic to invert for the\nfriction law parameters from afterslip data. We modeled afterslip measurements\nfor the Southern California Superstition Hills earthquake using the complete\nrate-and-state law, and found a huge variety of model parameters that can fit\nthe observed data. In particular, it is impossible to distinguish the stable\nvelocity strengthening regime (A>B) from the (potentially) unstable velocity\nweakening regime (B>A and stiffness k<kc). Therefore, it is not necessary to\ninvolve small scale spatial or temporal fluctuations of friction parameters A\nor B in order to explain the transition between stable sliding and seismic\nslip. In addition to B/A and stiffness k/kc, the fault behavior is strongly\ncontrolled by stress levels following an event. Stress heterogeneity can thus\nexplain most of the variety of postseismic behavior observed in nature.\nAfterslip will induce a progressive reloading of faults that are not slipping,\nwhich can trigger aftershocks. Using the relation between stress and seismicity\nderived from the rate-and-state friction law, we estimate the aftershock rate\ntriggered by afterslip. Aftershock rate does not simply scale with stress rate,\nbut exhibits a different characteristic time and power-law exponent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2007 10:51:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In contrast,\nhere we propose MaxREnt as a tool for applying statistical mechanics to\necology. We use MaxREnt to explain and predict species abundance patterns in\necological communities in terms of the most probable behaviour under given\nenvironmental constraints, in the same way that statistical mechanics explains\nand predicts the behaviour of thermodynamic systems. We show that MaxREnt\nunifies a number of different ecological patterns: (i) at relatively local\nscales a unimodal biodiversity-productivity relationship is predicted in good\nagreement with published data on grassland communities, (ii) the predicted\nrelative frequency of rare vs. abundant species is very similar to the\nempirical lognormal distribution, (iii) both neutral and non-neutral species\nabundance patterns are explained, (iv) on larger scales a monotonic\nbiodiversity-productivity relationship is predicted in agreement with the\nspecies-energy law, (v) energetic equivalence and power-law self-thinning\nbehaviour are predicted in resource-rich communities. We identify mathematical\nsimilarities between these ecological patterns and the behaviour of\nthermodynamic systems, and conclude that the explanation of ecological patterns\nis not unique to ecology but rather reflects the generic statistical behaviour\nof complex systems with many degrees of freedom under very general types of\nenvironmental constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2007 08:33:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Sep 2007 15:02:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2007 10:18:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-12-13"}

But some scholars criticize this conviction, defending\nlocal realism in various ways. We present here a new viewpoint based on an\nimproved version of the extended semantic realism (ESR) model that has been\nrecently worked out by one of the authors. The ESR model embodies the\nmathematical formalism of SQM into a more general framework in which not only\nlocal realism but also objectivity of physical properties holds, and the\nprobabilities of SQM are reinterpreted as conditional instead of absolute.\nHence the ESR model provides some predictions that are formally identical to\nthose of SQM but have a different physical interpretation, and further\npredictions that differ also formally from those of SQM. In particular, we show\nhere that the BI introduced by Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt (BCHSH\ninequalities) must be replaced by modified BCHSH inequalities. These depend on\ndetection probabilities which may be such that the new inequalities are never\nviolated by the conditional expectation values predicted by the model. The\ncondition that no violation occurs implies the existence of upper bounds on\ndetection probabilities, which makes the ESR model falsifiable. These results\nadmit an intuitive explanation in terms of unfair sampling but basically differ\nfrom the seemingly similar results obtained by other approaches in which the\nefficiency problem is discussed in order to vindicate some kind of local\nrealism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2007 13:36:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2007 15:23:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2007 13:22:20 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 23 Nov 2007 08:42:36 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 4 Jul 2008 12:30:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-04"}
