An AGB star in a wide binary system is considered as a 3-D piston\nmodel that can induce a 3-D quasi-spherical density structure in the\ncircumstellar envelope by orbital motion of the AGB star. The column density\npattern only depends on two parameters: eccentricity of the orbit e and the\nterminal outflow velocity to mean orbital velocity ratio gamma. When viewed\nperpendicular to the orbital plane, spiral, broken spiral, and incomplete\nconcentric shell patterns can be seen, while when viewed along the orbital\nplane, alternative concentric half-shell, egg-shell, and half-shell half-gap\npatterns will develop. Non-zero eccentricity causes asymmetry, while larger\ngamma makes a weaker pattern and helps bring out asymmetry. A spiral pattern\nmay becomes broken when e > 0.4. The spiral center is always less than 12% of\nspiral pitch away from the orbit center. One should have more chances (~ 80%)\nseeing spiral-like patterns than seeing concentric shells (~ 20%) in the\ncircumstellar envelope of wide binary AGB stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2007 01:48:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

This minimum is marked by\nthe vanishing of the Laplace overpressure $\\Delta P$, which together with the\nexistence of a $V$-interval where $d\\Delta P/dV>0$ guarantees stability against\ndissolution. The reduction of $\\Delta P$ is due to the saddle-shape deformation\nof most of the interface which accompanies the reduction in the mean curvature\nof the interface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Mar 2007 19:28:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-23"}

It is shown that the phase field theory accurately predicts the\nnucleation barrier height for this liquid when the model parameters are fixed\nby independent molecular dynamics calculations. We then address various aspects\nof polycrystalline solidification and associated crystal pattern formation at\nrelatively long timescales. This late stage growth regime, which is not\naccessible by molecular dynamics, involves nucleation at the growth front to\ncreate new crystal grains in addition to the effects of primary nucleation.\nFinally, we consider the limit of extreme polycrystalline growth, where the\ndisordering effect due to prolific grain formation leads to isotropic growth\npatterns at long times, i.e., spherulite formation. Our model of spherulite\ngrowth exhibits branching at fixed grain misorientations, induced by the\ninclusion of a metastable minimum in the orientational free energy. It is\ndemonstrated that a broad variety of spherulitic patterns can be recovered by\nchanging only a few model parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2007 13:15:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We\nprovide lower and upper bounds for the average acceptance probability in terms\nof the Renyi divergence of order 1/2. We show that the asymptotic finitude of\nthe entropic divergence is the necessary and sufficient condition for\nnon-vanishing acceptance probabilities in the limit of large dimensions.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that the upper bound is reasonably tight by showing\nthat the exponent is asymptotically exact for systems made up of a large number\nof independent and identically distributed subsystems.

Motivated by this\nobservation, we focus on relevant properties of integral circulant graphs.\nSpecifically, we bound the number of vertices of integral circulant graphs in\nterms of their degree, characterize bipartiteness and give exact bounds for\ntheir diameter. Additionally, we prove that circulant graphs with odd order do\nnot allow perfect state transfer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2007 09:37:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This technique is commonly used as a single photon source in\nmodern quantum optics experiments. A significant problem facing this technique\nis the inability of present day photo-detectors to resolve photon number. This\nresults in mixing with higher photon number terms. To overcome this several\ntechniques have been proposed, including multi-port detection and time-division\nmultiplexing. These techniques help approximate number resolving detection even\nwhen using non-number resolving detectors. In this paper we focus on 2-port\ndetection, the simplest such scheme. We show that by making the 2-port device\nasymmetric the fidelity of prepared photons can be improved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2007 01:00:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
