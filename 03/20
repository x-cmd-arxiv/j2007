These stars possess neither winds like\nearly-type stars nor convective envelopes as late-type stars, so that the\norigin and production mechanism of this X-emission is unclear. Aims: We\ninvestigate whether the presence of large magnetic fields is related to the\nobserved X-ray emission. Methods: We carried out Chandra high-angular\nresolution observations of a sample of late B-type and A-type stars with\nmeasured magnetic fields in the range from 0.2 - 17 kG. Out of the selected 10\nsample stars, 6 objects had been previously detected as X-ray sources, some of\nthem, however, with high positional uncertainty and a low signal-to-noise\nratio, while 4 of our sample stars do have large magnetic fields but no\nprevious detections of X-ray emission. Results: Our Chandra data confirm all\nprevious ROSAT detections with an extremely high significance, and the limits\nof the offsets between X-ray and optical positions are greatly improved. In\nparticular, HD 215441, known as Babcock's star with the strongest magnetic\nfield by far (17 kG) of our sample stars, a rather faint and somewhat marginal\nROSAT source, can clearly be detected. However, none of the 4 ROSAT\nnon-detections could be detected with the new Chandra observations.\nConclusions: The pure existence of a magnetic field of kiloGauss strength on a\nlate B-type or A-type star is therefore not necessarily a prerequisite for\nfinding X-ray emission among these stars. Understanding the observed X-ray\nemission from Babcock's star is a challenge for observational and theoretical\nastrophysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2007 11:23:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Then, each of the single-mode Hamiltonians $\\hat{H}_{k}$ is\ndiagonalized separately, and the resulting ground state wavefunction of the\ntotal Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ is written as a simple product of the ground state\nwavefunctions of each of the single-mode Hamiltonians $\\hat{H}_{k}$.

In this paper, we give a thorough review of Bogoliubov's\nmethod, and discuss a variational and number-conserving formulation of this\ntheory in which the ${k}=0$ state is restored to the Hilbert space of the\ninteracting gas, and where, instead of diagonalizing the Hamiltonians\n$\\hat{H}_{k}$ separately, we diagonalize the total Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ as a\nwhole.

However, this\ninformation is hidden inside the multiplicative character of the cascading\nprocess. Inspite of the great experimental and theoretical efforts the results\nof different studies are often ambiguous and even conflicting. These\ncontroversies can partly be referred to imperfections of our models of high\nenergy interactions. The first part of the paper is concerned with this\nproblem. The author thinks that the present models should be corrected to give\nslightly deeper penetration of the cascade into the atmosphere. In this respect\nthe modification suggested by the QGSJET-II model seems to be the step in the\nright direction. The Sibyll 2.1 model provides a similar penetrating\nproperties. However, this modification is not enough and a small additional\ntransfer of the energy from EAS hadrons to the electromagnetic component is\nneeded too. As a possible candidate for such a process the inelastic charge\nexchange of pions is discussed. In the second part of the paper the author\ndiscusses the need to account for the interaction of EAS with the stuff of\ndetectors, their environment and the ground in the light of the 'neutron\nthunder' phenomenon, discovered recently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2007 07:58:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

In this\npaper, we focus on some finite-size effects of the system because normally the\nsizes of most real systems are finite and small (e.g., size $\\leq 10,000$). A\nspecial finite-size effect of the two-lane system has been observed, which is\nthat the density wall moves left first and then move towards the right with the\nincrease of the lane-changing rate. We called it the jumping effect. We find\nthat increasing attachment and detachment rates will weaken the jumping effect.\nWe also confirmed that when the size of the two-lane system is large enough,\nthe jumping effect disappears, and the two-lane system has a similar density\nprofile to a single-lane TASEP coupled with Langmuir kinetics. Increasing\nlane-changing rates has little effect on density and current after the density\nreaches maximum. Also, lane-changing rate has no effect on density profiles of\na two-lane TASEP coupled with Langmuir kinetics at a large\nattachment/detachment rate and/or a large system size.
