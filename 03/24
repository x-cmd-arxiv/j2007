On the\nother hand, the H I(7-6) line is not associated with the gas in the disk\nsurface and magnetospheric accretion flows can account only for at most ~30% of\nthe observed flux. We conclude that accretion shock regions and/or the stellar\ncorona could contribute to most of the H I(7-6)emission.

A hydrodynamical simulation of a colliding winds binary (CWB) with clumpy\nwinds reveals that the clumps are rapidly destroyed after passing through the\nconfining shocks of the wind-wind collision region (WCR) for reasonable\nparameters of the clumps if the flow in the WCR is adiabatic. Despite large\ndensity and temperature fluctuations in the post-shock gas, the overall effect\nof the interaction is to smooth the existing structure in the winds. Averaged\nover the entire interaction region, the resulting X-ray emission is very\nsimilar to that from the collision of smooth winds. The insensitivity of the\nX-ray emission to clumping suggests it is an excellent diagnostic of the\nstellar mass-loss rates in wide CWBs, and may prove to be a useful addition to\nexisting techniques for deriving mass-loss rates, many of which are extremely\nsensitive to clumping. Clumpy winds also have implications for a variety of\nphenomena at the WCR: particle acceleration may occur throughout the WCR due to\nsupersonic MHD turbulence, re-acceleration at multiple shocks, and\nre-connection; a statistical description of the properties of the WCR may be\nrequired for studies of non-equilibrium ionization and the rate of electron\nheating; and the physical mixing of the two winds will be enhanced, as seems\nnecessary to trigger dust formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2007 17:28:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The standard approach is based on the optimization of a quality\nfunction, modularity, which is a relative quality measure for a partition of a\nnetwork into modules. Recently some authors [1,2] have pointed out that the\noptimization of modularity has a fundamental drawback: the existence of a\nresolution limit beyond which no modular structure can be detected even though\nthese modules might have own entity.

Initially the atom is in its\nupper state and the cavity mode empty of photons. Following Glauber, the\nspectrum is defined via the response of a detector atom. Spectra are calculated\nfor the detector located inside the cavity (case A), outside the cavity end\nmirror (Case B-end emission), or placed for emission out the side of the cavity\n(Case C). The spectra for case A and case B are found to be essentially the\nsame. In all the cases the predicted lineshapes are free of instrumental\neffects and only due to cavity decay. Spectra are presented for intermediate\nand strong coupling regime situations (where both atomic transitions are\nresonant with the cavity frequency), for cases of non-zero cavity detuning, and\nfor cases where the two atomic transition frequencies differ. The spectral\nfeatures for Cases B(A) and C are qualitatively similar, with six spectral\npeaks for resonance cases and eight for detuned cases. These general features\nof the spectra can be understood via the dressed atom model. However, Case B\nand C spectra differ in detail, with the latter exhibiting a deep spectral hole\nat the cavity frequency due to quantum interference effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2007 18:29:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Jul 2007 08:13:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}
