In the case of a lens it is found\nthat the line tension is independent of arbitrary choices of the Gibbs dividing\ninterfaces.

This phenomenon, well studied and understood on the macroscale, is\ninvestigated by Molecular Dynamics simulations for coarse-grained models of\nnanotubes. Both a simple Lennard-Jones fluid and a model for a polymer melt are\nconsidered. In both cases after a transient period (of a few nanoseconds) the\nmeniscus rises according to a $\\sqrt{\\textrm{time}}$-law. For the polymer melt,\nhowever, we find that the capillary flow exhibits a slip length $\\delta$,\ncomparable in size with the nanotube radius $R$. We show that a consistent\ndescription of the imbibition process in nanotubes is only possible upon\nmodification of the Lucas-Washburn law which takes explicitly into account the\nslip length $\\delta$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Mar 2007 16:15:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We find that local\nClifford transformations are completely described in terms of local\ncomplementation on nodes and along edges, loop complementation, and change of\nnode type or sign. Additionally, we show that a small set of equivalence rules\ngenerates all graphs corresponding to a given stabilizer state; we do this by\nconstructing an efficient procedure for testing the equality of any two\nstabilizer graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Mar 2007 18:43:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2007 15:26:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
