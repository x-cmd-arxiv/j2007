We addressed the issue of angular\nmomentum (J) transfer from the gas to the bar and its effect on the bar\nevolution. We find that the weakening of the bar, reported in the literature,\nis not related to the J-exchange with the gas, but is caused by the vertical\nbuckling instability in the gas-poor disks and by a steep heating of a stellar\nvelocity dispersion by the central mass concentration (CMC) in the gas-rich\ndisks. The gas has a profound effect on the onset of the buckling -- larger\nf_gas brings it forth due to the more massive CMCs. The former process leads to\nthe well-known formation of the peanut-shaped bulges, while the latter results\nin the formation of progressively more elliptical bulges, for larger f_gas. The\nsubsequent (secular) evolution of the bar differs -- the gas-poor models\nexhibit a growing bar while gas-rich models show a declining bar whose vertical\nswelling is driven by a secular resonance heating. The border line between the\ngas-poor and -rich models lies at f_gas ~ 3% in our models, but is\nmodel-dependent and will be affected by additional processes, like star\nformation and feedback from stellar evolution. The overall effect of the gas on\nthe evolution of the bar is not in a direct J transfer to the stars, but in the\nloss of J by the gas and its influx to the center that increases the CMC. The\nmore massive CMC damps the vertical buckling instability and depopulates orbits\nresponsible for the appearance of peanut-shaped bulges.

The\nmean fraction f_WIM of diffuse ionized gas in this sample is 0.59+/- 0.19,\nslightly higher than found in previous samples. Since lower surface-brightness\ngalaxies tend to have higher f_WIM, we believe that most of this difference is\ndue to selection effects favoring large, optically-bright, nearby galaxies with\nhigh star-formation rates. As found in previous studies, there is no\nappreciable correlation with Hubble type or total star-formation rate. However,\nwe find that starburst galaxies, defined here by an H-alpha surface brightness\n> 2.5x 10^39 erg s^-1 kpc^-2 within the H-alpha half-light radius, do show much\nlower fractions of diffuse H-alpha emission. The cause apparently is not\ndominated by a lower fraction of field OB stars. However, it is qualitatively\nconsistent with an expected escape of ionizing radiation above a threshold\nstar-formation rate, predicted from our model in which the ISM is shredded by\npressure-driven supernova feedback. The HI gas fractions in the starburst\ngalaxies are also lower, suggesting that the starbursts are consuming and\nionizing all the gas, and thus promoting regions of density-bounded ionization.\nIf true, these effects imply that some amount of Lyman continuum radiation is\nescaping from most starburst galaxies, and that WIM properties and outflows\nfrom mechanical feedback are likely to be pressure-driven. However, in view of\nprevious studies showing that the escape fraction of ionizing radiation is\ngenerally low, it is likely that other factors also drive the low fractions of\ndiffuse ionized gas in starbursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2007 22:17:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

To date, it appears that the\nmassive star population follows simple power-law clustering that extends down\nto individual field OB stars, and the robust stellar IMF seems to have a\nconstant upper-mass limit. These properties result in specific patterns in the\nHII region LF and ionization of the diffuse, warm ionized medium. The resulting\nSNe generate superbubbles whose size distribution is also described by a simple\npower law, and from which a galaxy's porosity parameter is easily derived. A\ncritical star-formation threshold can then be estimated, above which the escape\nof Lyman continuum photons, hot gas, and nucleosynthetic products is predicted.\nA first comparison with a large H-alpha sample of galaxies is broadly\nconsistent with this prediction, and suggests that ionizing photons likely\nescapes from starburst galaxies. The superbubble size distribution also offers\na basis for a Simple Inhomogeneous Model for galactic chemical evolution, which\nis especially relevant to metal-poor systems and instantaneous metallicity\ndistributions. This model offers an alternative interpretation of the Galactic\nhalo metallicity distribution and emphasizes the relative importance of\nstar-formation intensity, in addition to age, in a system's evolution. The\nfraction of zero-metallicity, Population III stars is easily predicted for any\nsuch model. We emphasize that all these phenomena can be modeled in a simple,\nanalytic framework over an extreme range in scale, offering powerful tools for\nunderstanding the role of massive stars in the cosmos.

Let $S^*$ be the dual of Lusztig's semicanonical basis $S$ of\n$U(\\n)$. We show that all cluster monomials of $A(C_M)$ belong to $S^*$, and\nthat $S^* \\cap A(C_M)$ is a basis of $A(C_M)$. Next, we prove that $A(C_M)$ is\nnaturally isomorphic to the coordinate ring of the finite-dimensional unipotent\nsubgroup $N(w)$ of the Kac-Moody group $G$ attached to $\\g$. Here w = w(M) is\nthe adaptable element of the Weyl group of $\\g$ which we associate to each\nterminal representation M of Q. Moreover, we show that the cluster algebra\nobtained from $A(C_M)$ by formally inverting the generators of the coefficient\nring is isomorphic to the coordinate ring of the unipotent cell $N^w := N \\cap\n(B_-wB_-)$ of G. We obtain a corresponding dual semicanonical basis of this\ncoorindate ring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2007 17:35:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Apr 2008 13:36:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 23 Apr 2008 10:33:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2010 09:05:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-02"}

Although the maximum dynamic range yielded\nby general SF networks is slightly worse than that of random networks, for\nspecial SF networks which lack loops the enhancement of the dynamic range can\nbe dramatic, reaching nearly five decades. In order to understand the role of\nloops on the transfer function we propose a simple model in which the density\nof loops in the network can be gradually increased, and show that this is\naccompanied by a gradual decrease of dynamic range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2007 20:03:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2007 21:41:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 May 2007 12:44:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

On the other hand, phenotype of an\nindividual also needs to be robust against fluctuations of both internal and\nexternal origins that are encountered during growth and development. Is there a\nrelationship between these two types of robustness, one during a single\ngeneration and the other during evolution? Could stochasticity in gene\nexpression have any relevance to the evolution of these robustness? Robustness\ncan be defined by the sharpness of the distribution of phenotype; the variance\nof phenotype distribution due to genetic variation gives a measure of `genetic\nrobustness' while that of isogenic individuals gives a measure of\n`developmental robustness'. Through simulations of a simple stochastic gene\nexpression network that undergoes mutation and selection, we show that in order\nfor the network to acquire both types of robustness, the phenotypic variance\ninduced by mutations must be smaller than that observed in an isogenic\npopulation. As the latter originates from noise in gene expression, this\nsignifies that the genetic robustness evolves only when the noise strength in\ngene expression is larger than some threshold. In such a case, the two\nvariances decrease throughout the evolutionary time course, indicating increase\nin robustness. The results reveal how noise that cells encounter during growth\nand development shapes networks' robustness to stochasticity in gene\nexpression, which in turn shapes networks' robustness to mutation. The\ncondition for evolution of robustness as well as relationship between genetic\nand developmental robustness is derived through the variance of phenotypic\nfluctuations, which are measurable experimentally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Mar 2007 00:52:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
