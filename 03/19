This\nobject was first noticed as a probable high $f_x/f_r$, high-luminosity blazar\nwithin the error region of a $\\approx 10^{-12}$ erg/s cm$^2$ ROSAT source\nwhich, however, also included a much brighter late-type star.

With\na luminosity well in excess of $10^{47}$ erg/s, ROXA J081009.9+384757.0 is\ntherefore one of the most luminous blazars known. We consider various\npossibilities for the nature of the electromagnetic emission from this source.\nIn particular, we show that the SED is consistent with that of a blazar with\nsynchrotron power peaking in the hard X-ray band. If this is indeed the case,\nthe combination of high-luminosity and synchrotron peak in the hard-X-ray band\ncontradicts the claimed anti-correlation between luminosity and position of the\nsynchrotron peak usually referred to as the \"blazar sequence\". An alternative\npossibility is that the X-rays are not due to synchrotron emission, in this\ncase the very peculiar SED of ROXA J081009.9+384757.0 would make it the first\nexample of a new class of radio loud AGN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2007 15:42:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Such galaxies are\nlikely to host nuclear super-massive black holes. METHODS: For 9 sources from\nthe Ho et al. optical sample, we isolated 10 individual Chandra X-ray sources\nclosest to the optical position and calculated X-ray luminosities, Lx, X-ray\ncolours, and, using Halpha luminosities, star formation rates. For 4 sources\nwith sufficient counts, we extracted X-ray spectra and fitted standard spectral\nmodels. We assessed the significance of adding an Fe K alpha emission Gaussian\ncomponent to a fit by means of a calibration of the standard F-test. For the\nrest of the sources, we estimated values for the intrinsic hydrogen column\ndensity, NHint, and the power-law photon index, Gamma, which can reproduce the\nobserved X-ray colours. RESULTS: For the nuclear sources in NGC 2782 and NGC\n3310, a Fe K alpha emission-line component is included with high significance,\nwhilst the power-law is flat (Gamma~0 and 1.3). Both sources have high\nstar-formation rates, with the rate for NGC 2782 being the highest in our\nsample. CONCLUSIONS: Our detection of Fe K alpha emission coming from a\ncentral, isolated source points towards a hidden AGN in 2 out of 9 relatively\nearly-type, star-forming spirals. The presence of an AGN is thus likely in\nmassive, disturbed starbursts, although the X-ray contribution is small: For\nthe central source, the bolometric luminosity is a fraction of a few x 10^-5 of\nthe Eddington luminosity. The X-ray flux of the central source is between 10\nand 20% of the total galactic flux in the 0.2-10 keV band.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2007 15:57:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

As a consequence, the \"gravitational\" mass and the\n\"inertial\" mass of a star are equal to each other. However, theories that\nenvision our world as embedded in a larger universe, with more than four\ndimensions, permit a number of possible non-Schwarzschild 4D exteriors, which\ntypically lead to {\\it different} masses, violating the weak equivalence\nprinciple of ordinary general relativity. Therefore, the question arises of\nwhether the violation of this principle, i.e., the equality of gravitational\nand inertial mass, is a necessary consequence of the existence of extra\ndimensions. In this paper, in the context of Kaluza-Klein gravity in 5D, we\nshow that the answer to this question is negative. We find a one-parameter\nfamily of asymptotically flat non-Schwarzschild static exteriors for which the\ninertial and gravitational masses are equal to each other, and equal to the\nDeser-Soldate mass. This family is consistent with the Newtonian weak-field\nlimit as well as with the general-relativistic Schwarzschild limit. Thus, we\nconclude that the existence of an extra dimension, and the corresponding\nnon-Schwarzschild exterior, does not necessarily require different masses.\nHowever, to an observer in 4D, it does affect the motion of test particles in\n4D, which is a consequence of the departure from the usual $(4D)$ law of\ngeodesic motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2007 02:47:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Mar 2007 19:32:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Feb 2008 06:12:43 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 8 May 2008 06:02:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-17"}

Based on the NLO BFKL\nequation, we construct a vertex for the production of a jet at central rapidity\nin k_T-factorization. A jet algorithm is introduced, and we take special care\nof the separation of multi-Regge and quasi-multi-Regge kinematics. The\nconnection with the energy scale of the evolution is investigated in detail.\nThe result is discussed for two situations: scattering of highly virtual\nphotons, which requires a symmetric energy scale to separate the impact factors\nfrom the gluon Green's function, and hadron-hadron collisions, where a\nnon-symmetric scale choice is needed. For the second case we are able to define\na NLO unintegrated gluon density, valid in the small-x regime, and give the\nevolution equation for this density as well.\n  In the second part, we examine the angular decorrelation of Mueller-Navelet\njets. Using an operator formalism in the space of anomalous dimension and\nconformal spin, we implement the NLO BFKL Green's function to study the\nrapidity dependence of angular decorrelations. We incorporate the necessary\nsummation of collinearly enhanced corrections beyond NLO accuracy. We compare\nour results with data from the Tevatron ppbar-collider and provide predictions\nfor the LHC as well. We also extend our study to the angular decorrelation\nbetween a forward jets and the electron in deep inelastic ep scattering. The\nangular decorrelation has not been measured in DIS so far, but we give\ntheoretical results for this observable which already implement the\nexperimental cuts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2007 08:45:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In particular, SUSY corrections to meson-antimeson mass differences\nDelta M(d,s) are always found to be positive with respect to the SM prediction.\nThis feature is due to an interesting interplay between chargino and gluino box\ndiagrams (the dominant contributions) in the different mass regimes one can\nconsider.\n  Finally, we point out that, due to the presence of gluinos, the MFV MSSM does\nnot belong -- even at low tan(beta) -- to the class of models with the\nso-called `constrained' MFV (CMFV), in which only the SM operator (V-A)x(V-A)\ncontributes to Delta M(d,s).

The approximation is based on an\nexponential ansatz of the transition probability for a finite time step $\\Delta\nt$, and a series expansion of the deviation of its logarithm from that of a\nGaussian distribution. Through this procedure, dubbed {\\em exponent expansion},\nthe transition probability is obtained as a power series in $\\Delta t$. This\nbecomes asymptotically exact if an increasing number of terms is included, and\nprovides remarkably accurate results even when truncated to the first few (say\n3) terms. The coefficients of such expansion can be determined\nstraightforwardly through a recursion, and involve simple one-dimensional\nintegrals.\n  We present several examples of financial interest, and we compare our results\nwith the state-of-the-art approximation of discretely sampled diffusions\n[A\\\"it-Sahalia, {\\it Journal of Finance} {\\bf 54}, 1361 (1999)].

We solve analytically the problem of decorrelation for two qubits and\ntwo qumodes (harmonic oscillators in Gaussian states), and provide sets of\ndecorrelable states and the minimum amount of noise to be added for\ndecorrelation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2007 13:21:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2007 08:18:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Probe pulses as short as 70 ns can be\ndelayed by a tunable time of up to 40 ns with little broadening or distortion.\nDuring the propagation, a probe pulse is amplified and generates a conjugate\npulse which is faster and separates from the probe pulse before getting locked\nto it at a fixed delay. The precise timing of this process allows us to\ndetermine the key coefficients of the susceptibility tensor. The presence of\ngain in this system makes this system very interesting in the context of\nall-optical information processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2007 14:50:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
