KaiB sequesters KaiA and stabilizes the\ndephosphorylating KaiC state.

Through an\nanalysis of the general structure of the RSP, we show that the entanglement\nentropy scales logarithmically with the size of a block and we provide a closed\nexpression for this scaling. This result is applicable for arbitrary quantum\nspin chains in the RSP, being dependent only on the magnitude S of the spin.\nRemarkably, the logarithmic scaling holds for the disordered chain even if the\npure chain with no disorder does not exhibit conformal invariance, as is the\ncase for Heisenberg integer spin chains. Our conclusions are supported by\nexplicit evaluations of the entanglement entropy for random spin-1 and spin-3/2\nchains using an asymptotically exact real-space renormalization group approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Mar 2007 18:44:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Jun 2007 18:11:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
