We have carried out a multiwavelength analysis of the\ninteracting system NGC 5291, which is remarkable for its extended HI ring\nhosting numerous intergalactic HII regions. We combined new ultraviolet (GALEX)\nobservations with archival Halpha, 8 mu m (Spitzer Space Telescope) and HI (VLA\nB-array) images of the system. We have found that the morphology of the star\nforming regions, as traced by the ultraviolet, Halpha, and 8 mu m emission is\nsimilar. There is a clear excess of ultraviolet emission compared to individual\nHII regions in spirals, i.e. the [8.0]/[NUV] and [Halpha]/[NUV] SFR ratios are\non average low although there are some large variations from one region to\nanother, which cannot be explained by variations of the metallicity or the dust\nextinction along the HI structure. Comparing the observed SFR with a model of\nthe evolution of [Halpha]/[NUV] with time favours young, quasi-instantaneous\nthough already fading starbursts. The total star formation rate measured in the\nintergalactic medium (which accounts for 80% of the total) surrounding NGC 5291\nis up to 1.3 Msun/yr, a value typical for spirals, assuming the standard SFR\ncalibrations are valid. The SFR drops by a factor of 2 to 4 in case the star\nformation is indeed quasi-instantaneous.

As a result, flows of matter,\nenergy and information circulate ever more easily across the planet. This\nglobal connectivity increases the interactions between agents, and thus the\npossibilities for conflict. However, evolutionary progress also reduces social\nfriction, via the creation of institutions. The emergence of such \"mediators\"\nis facilitated by stigmergy: the unintended collaboration between agents\nresulting from their actions on a shared environment. The Internet is a near\nideal medium for stigmergic interaction. Quantitative stigmergy allows the web\nto learn from the activities of its users, thus becoming ever better at helping\nthem to answer their queries.

The\nresults are applicable to a wide class of elastic materials and does not assume\nmaterial isotropy nor quasi-Hookean behaviour.

The\nfields are arranged into 4+2 dimensional chiral and vector supermultiplets, and\ntheir interactions are uniquely fixed by SUSY and 2T-physics gauge symmetries.\nMany 3+1 spacetimes emerge from 4+2 by gauge fixing. Gauge degrees of freedom\nare eliminated as one comes down from 4+2 to 3+1 dimensions without any\nremnants of Kaluza-Klein modes. In a special gauge, the remaining physical\ndegrees of freedom, and their interactions, coincide with ordinary N=1\nsupersymmetric field theory in 3+1 dimensions. In this gauge, SUSY in 4+2 is\ninterpreted as superconformal symmetry SU(2,2|1) in 3+1 dimensions.\nFurthermore, the underlying 4+2 structure imposes some interesting restrictions\non the emergent 3+1 SUSY field theory, which could be considered as part of the\npredictions of 2T-physics. One of these is the absence of the troublesome\nrenormalizable CP violating F*F terms. This is good for curing the strong CP\nviolation problem of QCD. An additional feature is that the superpotential is\nrequired to have no dimensionful parameters. To induce phase transitions, such\nas SUSY or electro-weak symmetry breaking, a coupling to the dilaton is needed.\nThis suggests a common origin of phase transitions that is driven by the vacuum\nvalue of the dilaton, and need to be understood in a cosmological scenario as\npart of a unified theory that includes the coupling of supergravity to matter.\nAnother interesting aspect is the possibility to utilize the inherent 2T gauge\nsymmetry to explore dual versions of the N=1 theory in 3+1 dimensions. This is\nexpected to reveal non-perturbative aspects of ordinary 1T field theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2007 02:19:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The control of the cell\ncycle - that was previously modeled by means of ad hoc thresholds - has been\ndirectly addressed here by considering checkpoints from proteins that act as\ntargets for phosphorylation on multiple sites. As simulated cells grow, they\ncan now modify the chemical composition of the surrounding environment which in\nturn acts as a feedback mechanism to tune cell metabolism and hence cell\nproliferation: in this way we obtain growth curves that match quite well those\nobserved in vitro with human leukemia cell lines.

We present the following scenario; if we consider the dynamics\nof a `partial' wave function, the dissipation is represented as a nonlocal term\nand it causes destructive interference to suppress the quantum fluctuation.\nUsing the variational method, we confirm that this dissipation term is a\nreasonable extension of the standard (Schr\\\"odinger) description for isolated\nsystems, from which we also derive the classical action. Consequently, in\nmacroscopic systems, the states whose time-integrated dissipation takes an\nextreme value come true. This description, which is consistent with our sense\nof reality, coexists with the usual linear-time-dependent description.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2007 03:11:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

By transferring\ntwo-player-two strategy (2x2) dilemma containing classical games into quantum\nrealm, dilemmas can be resolved in quantum pure strategies if entanglement is\ndistributed between the players who use quantum operations. Moreover, players\nreceive the highest sum of payoffs available in the game, which are otherwise\nimpossible in classical pure strategies. Encouraged by the observation of rich\ndynamics of physical systems with many interacting parties and the power of\nentanglement in quantum versions of 2x2 games, it became generally accepted\nthat quantum versions can be easily extended to N-player situations by simply\nallowing N-partite entangled states. In this article, however, we show that\nthis is not generally true because the reproducibility of classical tasks in\nquantum domain imposes limitations on the type of entanglement and quantum\noperators. We propose a benchmark for the evaluation of quantum and classical\nversions of games, and derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for a\nphysical realization. We give examples of entangled states that can and cannot\nbe used, and the characteristics of quantum operators used as strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2007 09:09:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
