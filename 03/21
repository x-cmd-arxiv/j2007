These are\nstrong non-axisymmetric features which significantly affect orbits of stars and\ndark matter particles. One of the main effects is the dynamical resonances\nbetween galactic material and the bar. We detect and characterize these\nresonances in N-body models of barred galaxies by measuring angular and radial\nfrequencies of individual orbits. We found narrow peaks in the distribution of\norbital frequencies with each peak corresponding to a specific resonance. We\nfound five different resonances in the stellar disk and two in the dark matter.\nThe corotation resonance and the inner and outer Lindblad resonances are the\nmost populated. The spatial distributions of particles near resonances are\nwide. For example, the inner Lindblad resonance is not localized at a given\nradius. Particles near this resonance are mainly distributed along the bar and\nspan a wide range of radii. On the other hand, particles near the corotation\nresonance are distributed in two broad areas around the two stable Lagrange\npoints. The distribution resembles a wide ring at the corotation radius.\nResonances capture disk and halo material in near-resonant orbits. Our analysis\nof orbits in both N-body simulations and in simple analytical models indicates\nthat resonances tend to prevent the dynamical evolution of this trapped\nmaterial. Only if the bar evolves as a whole, resonances drift through the\nphase space. In this case particles anchored near resonant orbits track the\nresonance shift and evolve. The criteria to ensure a correct resonant behavior\ndiscussed in Weinberg & Katz (2007a) can be achieved with few millions\nparticles because the regions of trapped orbits near resonances are large and\nevolving.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Mar 2007 01:59:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2007 01:11:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Two versions of POP-alpha are presented: the full\nPOP-alpha algorithm is derived from the LANS-alpha primitive equations, but\nrequires a nested iteration that makes it too slow for practical simulations; a\nreduced POP-alpha algorithm is proposed, which lacks the nested iteration and\nis two to three times faster than the full algorithm. The reduced algorithm\ndoes not follow from a formal derivation of the LANS-alpha model equations.\nDespite this, simulations of the reduced algorithm are nearly identical to the\nfull algorithm, as judged by globally averaged temperature and kinetic energy,\nand snapshots of temperature and velocity fields. Both POP-alpha algorithms can\nrun stably with longer timesteps than standard POP.\n  Comparison of implementations of full and reduced POP-alpha algorithms are\nmade within an idealized test problem that captures some aspects of the\nAntarctic Circumpolar Current, a problem in which baroclinic instability is\nprominent.
