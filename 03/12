NGC 300 X-1 is the second extragalactic candidate, after IC 10 X-1,\nin the rare class of Wolf-Rayet/compact object X-ray binary systems exemplified\nin the Galaxy by Cyg X-3. From a theoretical point of view, accretion onto a\nblack hole in a detached system is possible for large orbital periods only if\nthe mass of the relativistic object is high or the velocity of the accreted\nwind is low. Aims. We analysed a 2 week SWIFT XRT light curve of NGC 300 X-1\nand searched for periodicities. Methods. Period searches were made using\nLomb-Scargle periodogram analysis. We evaluated the confidence level using\nMonte Carlo simulations. Results. A period of 32.8+-0.4h (3 sigma error) was\nfound for NGC 300 X-1 with a confidence level >99%. Furthermore, we confirm the\nhigh irregular variability during the high flux level, as already observed in\nthe XMM-Newton observations of the source. A folded XMM-Newton light curve is\nshown, with a profile that is in agreement with SWIFT. The mean absorbed X-ray\nluminosity in the SWIFT observations was 1.5x10^38 erg/s, close to the value\nderived from the XMM-Newton data. Conclusions. While Cyg X-3 has a short period\nof 4.8 h, the period of NGC 300 X-1 is very close to that of IC 10 X-1\n(34.8+-0.9 h). These are likely orbital periods. Possibility of formation of\naccretion disk for such high orbital periods strongly depends on the terminal\nvelocity of the Wolf-Rayet star wind and black-hole mass. While low masses are\npossible for wind velocities < 1000 km/s, these increase to several tens of\nsolar masses for velocities > 1600 km/s and no accretion disk may form for\nterminal velocities larger than 1900 km/s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2007 15:57:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Therefore, all operators describing\ninteraction of $M$ valence electrons and $N-M$ core electrons (the core part of\nthe Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian\n  $V^{N-M}$, the correlation potential $\\hat\\Sigma_1({\\bf r},{\\bf r'},E)$ and\nthe screening of interaction between valence electrons by the core electrons\n$\\hat\\Sigma_2$) may be calculated with all\n  $M$ valence electrons removed. This allows one to avoid subtraction diagrams\nwhich make accurate inclusion of the core-valence correlations for $M>2$\nprohibitively complicated. Then the CI Hamiltonian for $M$ valence electrons is\ncalculated using orbitals in complete $V^{N}$ potential (the mean field\nproduced by all electrons); $\\hat\\Sigma_1$ + $\\hat\\Sigma_2$ are added to the CI\nHamiltonian to account for the core-valence correlations.
