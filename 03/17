Numerical treatments of these instabilities have historically been\nlimited in both dimensionality and input physics, leaving important questions\nabout their true evolution unanswered. We present the first three-dimensional\nradiation hydrodynamical calculations of both R-type and D-type ionization\nfront instabilities in galactic environments (i.e., solar metallicity gas).\nConsistent with linear stability analyses of planar D-type fronts, our models\nexhibit many short-wavelength perturbations growing at early times that later\nevolve into fewer large-wavelength structures. The simulations demonstrate that\nboth self-consistent radiative transfer and three-dimensional flow introduce\nsignificant morphological differences to unstable modes when compared to\nearlier two-dimensional approximate models. We find that the amplitude of the\ninstabilities in the nonlinear regime is primarily determined by the efficiency\nof cooling within the shocked neutral shell. Strong radiative cooling leads to\nlong, extended structures with pronounced clumping while weaker cooling leads\nto saturated modes that devolve into turbulent flows. These results suggest\nthat expanding H II regions may either promote or provide turbulent support\nagainst the formation of later generations of stars, with potential\nconsequences for star formation rates in the galaxy today.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Mar 2007 00:34:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 18 Aug 2007 00:44:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We identify HV absorption in Halpha and\nHe I 10830 A lines of SN 1999em and in Halpha of SN 2004dj as being due to this\neffect. The derived mass loss rate is close to 10^{-6} Msun/yr for both\nsupernovae, assuming a wind velocity 10 km/s. We argue that, in addition to the\nHV absorption formed in the unshocked ejecta, spectra of SN 2004dj and SN\n1999em show a HV notch feature that is formed in the cool dense shell (CDS)\nmodified by the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The CDS results from both shock\nbreakout and radiative cooling of gas that has passed through the reverse shock\nwave.

The deadbeat performance, already studied for the\nplants without delay, consists of a fast achievement of the steady state with\nan overshoot included in a narrow band and with minimum rise and settling\ntimes. In the proposed method the rise and settling times are both replaced\nwith the integral of the squared error and the constraint, which requires a\ncontroller output less than a preset value, is added. The transient behaviour\nis strictly evaluated by means of the analytical solutions of the relative\ndifferential difference equations, obtained by the method of steps for the\nfirst time.

This paper proves a reduction theorem which\nstates that the canonical variables on the Lie group can be eliminated, if and\nonly if the velocity map is a Lie algebra action, thereby producing the\nEuler-Poincar\\'e (EP) equation for the vector space variables. In this case,\nthe map from the canonical variables on the Lie group to the vector space is\nthe standard momentum map defined using the diamond operator. We apply the\nClebsch method in examples of the rotating rigid body and the incompressible\nEuler equations. Along the way, we explain how singular solutions of the EP\nequation for the diffeomorphism group (EPDiff) arise as momentum maps in the\nClebsch approach. In the case of finite dimensional Lie groups, the Clebsch\nvariational principle is discretised to produce a variational integrator for\nthe dynamical system. We obtain a discrete map from which the variables on the\ncotangent bundle of a Lie group may be eliminated to produce a discrete EP\nequation for elements of the vector space. We give an integrator for the\nrotating rigid body as an example.

In addition, a measurement of the excitation cross\nsection for $^{11}$Be+$^{208}$Pb at 38.6 MeV/nucleon is reported. The $B$(E1)\nstrength of 0.105(12) e$^2$fm$^2$ derived from this measurement is consistent\nwith those made previously at 60 and 64 MeV/nucleon, i n contrast to an\nanomalously low result obtained at 43 MeV/nucleon. By coupling a\nmulti-configuration description of the projectile structure with realistic\nreaction theory, the XCDCC model provides for the first time a fully quantum\nmechanical description of Coulomb excitation. The XCDCC calculations reveal\nthat the excitation process involves significant contributions from nuclear,\ncontinuum, and higher-order effects. An analysis of the present and two earlier\nintermediate energy measurements yields a combined B(E1) strength of 0.105(7)\ne$^2$fm$^2$. This value is in good agreement with the value deduced\nindependently from the lifetime of the $1/2^-$ state in $^{11}$Be, and has a\ncomparable p recision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2007 20:41:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 May 2007 19:54:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We have developed a novel\nmethod that is specifically designed to detect genetic association involving\nmultiple disease-susceptibility loci, possibly on different chromosomes. Our\napproach relies on the efficient discovery of patterns comprising spatially\nunrestricted polymorphic markers and on the use of appropriate test statistics\nto evaluate pattern-trait association. Power calculations using multi-locus\ndisease models demonstrate significant gain of power by using this method in\ndetecting multi-locus genetic association when compared to a standard single\nmarker analysis method. When analyzing a Schizophrenia dataset, we confirmed a\npreviously identified gene-gene interaction.
