An estimate of the radial velocity amplitude from spectral\nabsorption features, combined with the orbital inclination (83.5 deg) estimated\nfrom lightcurve fitting, yielded a total mass of M=(1.041 +/- 0.06)M_sun and\ncomponent masses of M_A=(0.529 +/- 0.035)M_sun and M_B=(0.512 +/- 0.035)M_sun.\nThe radial velocity amplitude estimated from absorption features (167 +/-\n3)kmps was found to be less than the estimate from the H_alpha emission lines\n(175 +/- 1.5)kmps. The lightcurve fit produced radii of R_A=(0.641 +/-\n0.05)R_sun and R_B=(0.608 +/- 0.06)R_sun, and a temperature ratio of\nT_B/T_A=0.980 +/- 0.015. The apparent magnitude of the binary was estimated to\nbe V=13.9 +/- 0.2. Combined with the spectral type, this gave the distance to\nthe binary as 169 +/- 14 pc. The timing of the secondary eclipse gave a lower\nlimit on the eccentricity of the binary system of 0.0025 +/- 0.0005. This is\nthe most statistically significant non-zero eccentricity found for such a\nsystem, possibly suggesting the presence of a third companion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2007 05:08:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We applied\nVoronoi binning to our data to get smoothed colour maps of the galaxies.\nComparison with N-body simulations from the literature gives more insight to\nthe origin of the shell features. Shell positions and dust characteristics are\ninferred from model galaxy subtracted images. RESULT: The ACS images reveal\nshells well within the effective radius in some galaxies (at 1.7 kpc in the\ncase of NGC 5982). In some cases, strong nuclear dust patches prevent detection\nof inner shells. Most shells have colours which are similar to the underlying\ngalaxy. Some inner shells are redder than the galaxy.

We define isotropization as the\ndevelopment of an anisotropic system as it reaches isotropy. The inverse of the\nintroduced total transport rate gives the correct time scale of the momentum\nisotropization. The contributions of the various scattering processes to the\nmomentum isotropization can be separated into the transport collision rates. In\ncontrast to the transport cross section, the transport collision rate has an\nindirect but correctly implemented relationship with the collision-angle\ndistribution. Based on the calculated transport collision rates from BAMPS for\ncentral Au+Au collisions at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider energies, we show\nthat pQCD $gg \\leftrightarrow ggg$ bremsstrahlung processes isotropize the\nmomentum five times more efficiently than elastic scatterings. The large\nefficiency of the bremsstrahlung stems mainly from its large momentum\ndeflection. Due to kinematics, $2\\to N$ $(N>2)$ production processes allow more\nparticles to become isotropic in momentum space and thus kinetically\nequilibrate more quickly than their back reactions or elastic scatterings. We\nalso show that the relaxation time in the relaxation time approximation, which\nis often used, is strongly momentum dependent and thus cannot serve as a global\nquantity that describes kinetic equilibration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Mar 2007 20:28:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2007 11:48:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
