Its precise\nspatial scale has been forwarded as a rigid-rod ruler test for the space-time\ngeometry, and hence as a probe for tracking the evolution of Dark Energy.\nPercent-level shifts in the measured position can bias such a test and erode\nits power to constrain cosmology. This paper addresses some of the systematic\neffects that might induce shifts: namely non-linear corrections from matter\nevolution, redshift space distortions and biasing. We tackle these questions\nthrough analytic methods and through a large battery of numerical simulations,\nwith total volume of the order ~100[Gpc\\h]^3. A toy-model calculation shows\nthat if the non-linear corrections simply smooth the acoustic peak, then this\ngives rise to an `apparent' shifting to smaller scales. However if tilts in the\nbroad band power spectrum are induced then this gives rise to more pernicious\n`physical' shifts. Our numerical simulations show evidence of both: in real\nspace and at z=0, for the dark matter we find percent level shifts; for haloes\nthe shifts depend on halo mass, with larger shifts being found for the most\nbiased samples, up to 3%. From our analysis we find that physical shifts are\ngreater than ~0.4% at z=0. In redshift space these effects are exacerbated, but\nat higher redshifts are alleviated. We develop an analytical model to\nunderstand this, based on solutions to the pair conservation equation using\ncharacteristic curves. When combined with modeling of pairwise velocities the\nmodel reproduces the main trends found in the data. The model may also help to\nunbias the acoustic peak.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2007 19:36:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Dec 2007 12:49:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The nuclear spin bath, because of its bifurcated\nevolution predicated on the electron spin up or down state, measures the\nwhich-state information of the electron spin and hence diminishes its\ncoherence. The many-body dynamics of nuclear spin bath is solved with a\npair-correlation approximation. In the relevant timescale, nuclear pair-wise\nflip-flops, as elementary excitations in the mesoscopic bath, can be mapped\ninto the precession of non-interacting pseudo-spins. Such mapping provides a\ngeometrical picture for understanding the decoherence and for devising control\nschemes.

In contrast to the re-focusing of\ninhomogeneously broadened phases by conventional spin-echoes, the\ndisentanglement is realized through shepherding quantum evolution of the bath\nstate via control of the quantum object.

The goal of this study is to understand the role of the gravitational\nspin-spin interaction in the process of mini-black-hole formation in particle\ncollisions. To simplify the problem we consider several gyraton models with\nspecial profiles of the energy and spin density distribution. For these models\nwe study the apparent horizon (AH) formation on the future edge of a spacetime\nregion before interaction. We demonstrate that the AH forms only if the energy\nduration and the spin are smaller than some critical values, while the length\nof the spin distribution should be at least of the order of the system\ngravitational radius. We also study gravitational spin-spin interaction in the\nhead-on collision of two gyratons under the assumption that the values of\ngyraton spins are small. We demonstrate that the metric in the interaction\nregion for such gyratons depends on the relative helicities of incoming\ngyratons, and the collision of gyratons with oppositely directed spins allows\nthe AH formation in a larger parameter region than in the collision of the\ngyratons with the same direction of spins.

We also show that Casimir forces in quantum graphs can be reliably\ncomputed by summing over the classical orbits, and study the rate of\nconvergence of the periodic orbit expansion. In generic situations where no\nanalytic expression is available, the sign and approximate magnitude of Casimir\nforces can often be obtained using only the shortest classical orbits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2007 02:07:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-18"}
