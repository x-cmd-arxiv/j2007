The problem is cast mathematically in the general framework of\ncontrol problems and is treated in the context of dynamically changing\nenvironments where control is coupled to human-centered automation. Since in\nthis case control might not be limited to a small number of control settings,\nas it is often assumed in the control literature, serious difficulties arise in\nthe solution of this problem. We demonstrate that the problem can be reduced to\na set of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations where human factors are incorporated\nvia estimations of the system Hamiltonian.

In the special case when $l(t)=-\\log t,$ existence of\noptimal maps on the sphere was obtained earlier by Glimm-Oliker and\nindependently by X.-J. Wang under more restrictive assumptions. In these\nstudies, it was assumed that either $\\mu$ and $\\nu$ are absolutely continuous\nwith respect to the $d$--dimensional Haussdorff measure, or they have disjoint\nsupports. Another aspect of interest in this work is that it is in contrast\nwith a result by Gangbo-McCann who proved that when $l(t)=t$ then existence of\nan optimal map fails when $\\mu$ and $\\nu$ are supported by Jordan surfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Feb 2007 15:00:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
