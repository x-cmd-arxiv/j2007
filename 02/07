The helical\nline current field, in including the effects of flux rope writhe, is therefore\nmore topologically complex than straight line and ring current fields sometimes\nused in solar flux rope models.

So, other (external) effects must play a dominant role in the\ndestruction of star clusters in the solar neighborhood.

Here we explore\nthe concept that dark matter is sterile neutrinos, particles that are commonly\nreferred to as Warm Dark Matter. Such particles have keV masses, and decay over\na very long time, much longer than the Hubble time. In their decay they produce\nX-ray photons which modify the ionization balance in the very early universe,\nincreasing the fraction of molecular Hydrogen, and thus help early star\nformation. Sterile neutrinos may also help to understand the baryon-asymmetry,\nthe pulsar kicks, the early growth of black holes, the minimum mass of dwarf\nspheroidal galaxies, as well as the shape and smoothness of dark matter halos.\nAs soon as all these tests have been made quantitative in their various\nparameters, we may focus on the creation mechanism of these particles, and\ncould predict the strength of the sharp X-ray emission line, expected from any\nlarge dark matter assembly. A measurement of this X-ray emission line would be\ndefinitive proof for the existence of may be called weakly interacting\nneutrinos, or WINs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2007 21:47:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

To investigate this apparent\ndiscrepancy we performed numerical simulations of expanding magnetized jets\nwith stochastically variable input velocities with the AstroBEAR MHD code.\nBecause the magnetic field B is proportional to the density n within\ncompression and rarefaction regions, the magnetic signal speed drops in\nrarefactions and increases in the compressed areas of velocity-variable flows.\nIn contrast, B ~ n^0.5 for a steady-state conical flow with a toroidal field,\nso the Alfven speed in that case is constant along the entire jet. The\nsimulations show that the combined effects of shocks, rarefactions, and\ndivergent flow cause magnetic fields to scale with density as an intermediate\npower 1 > p > 0.5. Because p > 0.5, the Alfven speed in rarefactions decreases\non average as the jet propagates away from the star. This behavior is extremely\nimportant to the flow dynamics because it means that a typical Alfven velocity\nin the jet close to the star is significantly larger than it is in the\nrarefactions ahead of bow shocks at larger distances, the one place where the\nfield is a measurable quantity.

We develop an analytic model to calculate the expected impact\nof mergers on the masses of black holes in massive clusters of galaxies. We use\nthe extended Press-Schechter formalism to generate Monte Carlo merger histories\nof halos with a mass 10^{15} h^{-1} Msun. We assume that the black hole mass\nfunction at z=2 is similar to that inferred from observations at z=0 (since\nquasar activity declines markedly at z<2), and we assign black holes to the\nprogenitor halos assuming a monotonic relation between halo mass and black hole\nmass. We follow the dynamical evolution of subhalos within larger halos,\nallowing for tidal stripping, the loss of orbital energy by dynamical friction,\nand random orbital perturbations in gravitational encounters with subhalos, and\nwe assume that mergers of subhalos are followed by mergers of their central\nblack holes. Our analytic model reproduces numerical estimates of the subhalo\nmass function. We find that the most massive black holes in massive clusters\ntypically grow by a factor ~ 2 by mergers after gas accretion has stopped. In\nour ten realizations of 10^{15} h^{-1} Msun clusters, the highest initial (z=2)\nblack hole masses are 5-7 x 10^9 Msun, but four of the clusters contain black\nholes in the range 1-1.5 x 10^{10} Msun at z=0.

The scaling theory\nallows us to determine the influence of the modular structure on transport. We\nalso generalize our theory by presenting and verifying scaling arguments for\nthe dependence of transport on microscopic features, such as the degree of the\nnodes and the distance between them. Using transport concepts such as diffusion\nand resistance we exploit this invariance and we are able to explain, based on\nthe topology of the network, recent experimental results on the broad flow\ndistribution in metabolic networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2007 16:28:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The problem becomes even\nmore challenging as the spinodal is approached. In this work, we have\nundertaken extensive computer simulation studies to probe the molecular\nmechanism for the onset of instability. We have constructed the free energy\nsurfaces of nucleation as a function of multiple reaction coordinates, both for\nsupercooled Lennard-Jones fluid and for 2- and 3-dimensional Ising models.\nWhile the classical Becker-Doring (BD) picture of homogenous nucleation, that\nassumes the growth of a single nucleus by single particle addition, holds good\nat low to moderate supersaturation, the formation of the new stable phase\nbecomes more collective and spread over the whole system at large\nsupersaturation. As the spinodal curve is approached from the coexistence line,\nthe free energy, as a function of the size of the largest liquid-like cluster,\ndevelops a minimum at a sub-critical cluster size. This minimum at intermediate\nsize is responsible for the barrier towards further growth of the nucleus at\nlarge supersaturation. As the spinodal is approached closely, this minimum\ngradually disappears and so does the free energy barrier for the cluster\ngrowth. We find the emergence of an alternative free energy pathway (with a\nbarrier less than that in the BD picture) that involves participation of many\nsub-critical liquid-like clusters and the growth of the stable phase is\npromoted by a coalescence mechanism. Very close to the spinodal the free energy\nsurface becomes quite flat, the significance of a critical nucleus is lost and\nthe classical Becker-Doring picture of nucleation breaks down.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2007 21:06:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Similarly, the temporal evolution can be modified by introducing waiting\ntimes Dt between subsequent moves which are distributed algebraically as P(Dt)~\n(Dt)^(-1-kappa). It turns out that such systems with Levy-distributed\nlong-range interactions still exhibit a continuous phase transition with\ncritical exponents varying continuously with sigma and/or kappa in certain\nranges of the parameter space. In a field-theoretical framework such\nalgebraically distributed long-range interactions can be accounted for by\nreplacing the differential operators nabla^2 and d/dt with fractional\nderivatives nabla^sigma and (d/dt)^kappa. As another possibility, one may\nintroduce algebraically decaying long-range interactions which cannot exceed\nthe actual distance to the nearest particle.

Mathematical modelling is most suitable to\nimprove knowledge about the function of various transmembrane currents provided\nthe model is based on reliable data. This is the first attempt to build a\nmathematical model for the betacell-electrophysiology in a bottom-up approach\nwhich relies on single protein conductivity data. The results of previous\nwhole-cell-based models are reconsidered. The full simulation including all\nprominent transmembrane proteins in betacells is used to provide a functional\ninterpretation of their role in betacell-bursting and an updated vantage point\nof betacell-electrophysiology. As a result of a number of in silico knock-out-\nand block-experiments the novel model makes some unexpected predictions:\nSingle-channel conductivity data imply that calcium-gated potassium currents\nare rather small. Thus, their role in burst interruption has to be revisited.\nAn alternative role in high calcium level oscillations is proposed and an\nalternative burst interruption model is presented. It also turns out that\nsodium currents are more relevant than expected so far. Experiments are\nproposed to verify these predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Feb 2007 13:10:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
