However,\naddressing the systematic effects in the increasingly sensitive, high\nresolution, `full' sky measurements from different CMB experiments pose a stiff\nchallenge. The analysis techniques must not only be computationally fast to\ncontend with the huge size of the data, but, the higher sensitivity also limits\nthe simplifying assumptions which can then be invoked to achieve the desired\nspeed without compromising the final precision goals. While maximum likelihood\nis desirable, the enormous computational cost makes the suboptimal method of\npower spectrum estimation using Pseudo-C_l unavoidable for high resolution\ndata. We provide a (semi)analytic framework to estimate bias in the power\nspectrum due to the effect of beam non-circularity and non-uniform sky coverage\nincluding incomplete/masked sky maps and scan strategy. The approach is\nperturbative in the distortion of the beam from non-circularity, allowing for\nrapid computations when the beam is mildly non-circular. We advocate that it is\ncomputationally advantageous to employ `soft' azimuthally apodized masks whose\nspherical harmonic transform die down fast with m. We numerically implement our\nmethod for non-rotating beams. We present preliminary estimates of the\ncomputational cost to evaluate the bias for the upcoming CMB anisotropy probes\nl_max~3000, with angular resolution comparable to the Planck surveyor mission.\nWe further show that this implementation and estimate is applicable for\nrotating beams on equal declination scans and possibly can be extended to\nsimple approximations to other scan strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2007 17:04:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Nov 2008 09:24:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-31"}

The\nselection criteria are described and their influence on the results discussed.\n  Results: Considering only the simplest HI profiles, we demonstrate that for\nGaussians with relatively small LSR velocities (-9 <= V_C <= 4 km/s) it is\npossible to distinguish three or four groups of preferred line-widths with mean\nwidths FWHM = 3.9 +- 0.6, 11.8 +- 0.5, 24.1 +- 0.6, and 42 +- 5 km/s.

He used a human-assisted decomposition for a nearly 50 times smaller\ndatabase and we discuss systematic differences in analysis and results.\n  Conclusions: The line-widths of about 3.9 and 24.1 km/s are well understood\nin the framework of traditional models of the two-phase interstellar medium.\nThe components with the widths around 11.8 km/s indicate that a considerable\nfraction (up to about 40%) of the HI gas is thermally unstable. The reality and\nthe origin of the broad lines with the widths of about 42 km/s is more obscure.\nThese, however, contain only about 4% of the total observed column densities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2007 12:59:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We find that the spin susceptibility measured by the\nKnight shift remains unchanged across the superconducting transition\ntemperature T_c. With decreasing temperature (T) below T_c, the spin-lattice\nrelaxation rate 1/T_1 decreases with no coherence peak and is in proportion to\nT^3. These results indicate that the Cooper pair is in the spin-triplet state\nand that there exist line nodes in the superconducting gap function. They are\nin sharp contrast with those in the isostructural Li_2Pd_3B which is a\nspin-singlet, s-wave superconductor, and are ascribed to the enhanced\nspin-orbit coupling due to the lack of spatial inversion symmetry. Our finding\npoints to a new paradigm where exotic superconductivity arises in the absence\nof strong electron-electron correlations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2007 08:47:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Given a total\nsystem bandwidth of W Hz and a fixed data rate constraint of R bps for each\ntransmission, how many frequency slots N of size W/N should the band be\npartitioned into to maximize the number of simultaneous transmissions in the\nnetwork? In an interference-limited ad-hoc network, dividing the available\nspectrum results in two competing effects: on the positive side, it reduces the\nnumber of users on each band and therefore decreases the interference level\nwhich leads to an increased SINR, while on the negative side the SINR\nrequirement for each transmission is increased because the same information\nrate must be achieved over a smaller bandwidth.
