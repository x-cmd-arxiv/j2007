In general, all the fossils\nwe study show regular and symmetric X-ray emission, indicating an absence of\nrecent major group mergers. We confirm that, for a given optical luminosity of\nthe group, fossils are more X-ray luminous than non-fossil groups. Fossils,\nhowever, fall comfortably on the conventional L_X-T_X relation of galaxy groups\nand clusters, suggesting that their X-ray luminosity and their gas temperature\nare both boosted, arguably, as a result of their early formation. This is\nsupported by other scaling relations including the L_X-sigma and T_X-sigma\nrelations in which fossils show higher X-ray luminosity and temperature for a\ngiven group velocity dispersion. We find that mass concentration in fossils is\nhigher than in non-fossil groups and clusters. In addition, the M_X-T_X\nrelation suggests that fossils are hotter, for a given total gravitational\nmass, both consistent with an early formation epoch for fossils. We show that\nthe mass-to-light ratio in fossils is rather high but not exceptional, compared\nto galaxy groups and clusters. The entropy of the gas in low mass fossils\nappears to be systematically lower than that in normal groups, which may\nexplain why the properties of fossils are more consistent with an extension of\ncluster properties. We conclude that the cuspy potential raises the luminosity\nand temperature of the IGM in fossils. However, this works in conjunction with\nlower gas entropy, which may arise from less effective preheating of the gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Feb 2007 16:08:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We carry out a comparative study between samples of confirmed and\nwell-studied SPB stars and a sample of well-studied Bp stars with known periods\nand magnetic field strengths. We determine their evolutionary state using\naccurate HIPPARCOS parallaxes and Geneva photometry. We discuss the occurrence\nand strengths of magnetic fields as well as the occurrence of stellar pulsation\namong both groups. Further, we make a comparison of Geneva photometric\nvariability for both kinds of stars.\n  Results. The group of Bp stars is significantly younger than the group of SPB\nstars. Longitudinal magnetic fields in SPB stars are weaker than those of Bp\nstars, suggesting that the magnetic field strength is an important factor for B\ntype stars to become chemically peculiar. The strongest magnetic fields appear\nin young Bp stars, indicating a magnetic field decay in stars at advanced ages.\nRotation periods of Bp and pulsation periods of SPB stars are of the same order\nand the behaviour of Geneva photometric variability of some Bp stars cannot be\ndistinguished from the variability of SPB stars, illustrating the difficulty to\ninterpret the observed variability of the order of days for B-type stars. We\nconsider the possibility that pulsation could be responsible for the\nvariability among chemically peculiar stars. In particular, we show that a\nnon-linear pulsation model is not excluded by photometry for the Bp star\nHD175362.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2007 11:29:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

These models are applied to\nthe case of the Orion Nebula Cluster, where the presence of a strong\nultraviolet field from the central OB stars, together with a detailed census of\ncircumstellar discs and photoevaporative flows, is well established. In\nparticular we investigate the constraints that are placed on the initial disc\nproperties in the ONC by the twin requirement that most stars possess a disc on\na scale of a few A.U., but that only a minority ($< 20 %$) are resolved by HST\nat a scale of 50 A.U.. We find that these requirements place very weak\nconstraints on the initial radius distribution of circumstellar discs: the\nresulting size distribution readily forgets the initial radius distribution,\nowing to the strong positive dependence of the photoevaporation rate on disc\nradius. Instead, the scarcity of large discs reflects the relative scarcity of\ninitially massive discs (with mass $> 0.1 M_\\odot$). The ubiquity of discs on a\nsmall scale, on the other hand, mainly constrains the timespan over which the\ndiscs have been exposed to the ultraviolet field ($< 2 $Myr). We argue that the\ndiscs that are resolved by HST represent a population of discs in which\nself-gravity was important at the time that the dominant central OB star\nswitched on, but that, according to our models, self-gravity is unlikely to be\nimportant in these discs at the present time.

Finally, local\nthermodynamic equilibrium abundance estimates for the yield of radioactive 56Ni\ngive ~0.5 Msun, for SN 2003hv, but only ~0.13-0.22 Msun for the apparently\nsubluminous SN 2005df, supporting the notion that the luminosity of SNe Ia is\nprimarily a function of the radioactive 56Ni yield.\n  The chemically stratified ejecta structure observed in SN 2005df matches the\npredictions of delayed-detonation (DD) models, but is entirely incompatible\nwith current three-dimensional deflagration models.

With unit weights, we can compute subset\nsizes which together with the previous sums provide the subset averages. The\nquestion addressed here is which sampling scheme we should use to get the most\naccurate subset sum estimates.\n  We present a simple theorem on the variance of subset sum estimation and use\nit to prove variance optimality and near-optimality of subset sum estimation\nwith different known sampling schemes. This variance is measured as the average\nover all subsets of any given size. By optimal we mean there is no set of input\nweights for which any sampling scheme can have a better average variance. Such\npowerful results can never be established experimentally. The results of this\npaper are derived mathematically. For example, we show that appropriately\nweighted systematic sampling is simultaneously optimal for all subset sizes.\nMore standard schemes such as uniform sampling and\nprobability-proportional-to-size sampling with replacement can be arbitrarily\nbad.\n  Knowing the variance optimality of different sampling schemes can help\ndeciding which sampling scheme to apply in a given context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2007 15:55:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
