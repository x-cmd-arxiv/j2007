Unfortunately, sufficiently thin\ncurrent sheets cannot be resolved observationally and the theory of their\nformation is an unresolved issue as well. We consider two predictors of coronal\ncurrent concentrations, both based on geometrical or even topological\nproperties of a force free coronal magnetic field. First, there are\nseparatrices related to magnetic nulls. Through separatrices the magnetic\nconnectivity changes discontinuously. Coronal magnetic nulls are, however, very\nrare. At second, inspired by the concept of generalized magnetic reconnection\nwithout nulls, quasi-separatrix layers (QSL) were suggested. Through QSL the\nmagnetic connectivity changes continuously, though strongly. The strength of\nthe connectivity change can be quantified by measuring the squashing of the\nflux tubes which connect the magnetically conjugated photospheres.\n  We verify the QSL and separatrix concepts by comparing the sites of magnetic\nnulls and enhanced squashing with the location of current concentrations in the\ncorona. Due to the known difficulties of their direct observation we simulated\nthe coronal current sheets by numerically calculating the response of the\ncorona to energy input from the photosphere heating a simultaneously observed\nEUV Bright Point. We did not find coronal current sheets not at the\nseparatrices but at several QSL locations. The reason is that although the\ngeometrical properties of force free extrapolated magnetic fields can indeed,\nhint at possible current concentrations, a necessary condition for current\nsheet formation is the local energy input into the corona.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Feb 2007 15:11:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
