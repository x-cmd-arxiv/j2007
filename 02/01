The efficiency and duty cycle of the star formation activity within dark\nmatter halos are determined by fitting the luminosity functions of Lya emitter\nand Lyman-break galaxies at redshifts z~5-6. Using our model parameters we\npredict the likely abundance of star forming galaxies at earlier epochs and\ncompare these to the emerging data in the redshift interval 7<z<10. We find\nthat the abundance of luminous Lyman-break galaxies in the 500 Myr between z~6\nand 10 can be naturally explained by the hierarchical assembly of dark matter\nhaloes; there is only marginal evidence for strong physical evolution. In\ncontrast, the first estimates of the abundance of less luminous star forming\ngalaxies at z=9-10 are higher than predicted and, if verified by further data,\nmay suggest a top-heavy stellar mass function at these early epochs. Although\nthese abundances remain uncertain because of the difficulty of spectroscopic\nconfirmation and cosmic variance, even a modest improvement in survey\ncapability with present or upcoming facilities should yield great progress. In\nthis context, we use our model to consider those observational techniques that\nhold the most promise and make predictions for specific surveys that are, or\nwill soon be, underway. We conclude that narrowband Lya emitter surveys should\nbe efficient on searches at z~7-8; however, such conventional surveys are\nunlikely to detect sufficient galaxies at z~10 to provide useful constraints.\nFor this reason, gravitational lensing offers the best prospect for probing the\nz~10 universe prior to JWST.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jan 2007 20:54:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Feb 2007 05:14:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The rest-frame PDS\nanalysis at gamma-ray energies shows that the two ACF classes are not simply\ncharacterised by a different low frequency cut-off, but they have a distinct\nvariability as a whole in the studied frequency range. Both classes exhibit\naverage PDS with power-law behaviour at high frequencies (f' > 0.1 Hz) but\nsignificantly different slopes, with index values close to those of Brownian\n(-2) and Kolmogorov (-5/3) spectra for the narrow and broad classes\nrespectively. The latter spectrum presents an additional PDS component, a\nlow-frequency noise excess with a sharp cut-off. At X-ray energies we find the\npower-law index unchanged for the broad class, but a significantly steeper\nslope in the narrow case (~ -3). We interpret this as an indication that the\nbroad class bursts have weaker spectral evolution than the narrow ones, as\nsuggested also by our analysis of the ACF energy dependence.

Then for each diffuse\nstar particle identified at z=0, we look for the galaxy to which it once\nbelonged at an earlier redshift, thus linking the presence of the diffuse\nstellar component to the galaxy formation history. The main results of our\nanalysis are: (i) On average, half of the DSC star particles comes from\ngalaxies associated with the family tree of the most massive galaxy (BCG), one\nquarter comes from the family trees of other massive galaxies, and the\nremaining quarter from dissolved galaxies. I.e., the formation of the DSC is\nparallel to the build-up of the BCG and other massive galaxies. (ii) Most DSC\nstar particles become unbound during mergers in the formation history of the\nBGCs and of other massive galaxies, independent of cluster mass. Our results\nsuggest that the tidal stripping mechanism is responsible only for a minor\nfraction of the DSC. (iii) At cluster radii larger than 250 kpc/h, the DSC\nfraction from the BCG is reduced and the largest contribution comes from the\nother massive galaxies; in the cluster outskirts, galaxies of all masses\ncontribute to the DSC. (iv) The DSC does not have a preferred redshift of\nformation: however, most DSC stars are unbound at z<1. (v) The amount of DSC\nstars at z=0 does not corre late strongly with the global dynamical history of\nclusters, and increases weakly with cluster mass.

The spatial and size\ndistributions of dust grains in the disks are numerically computed by solving\nthe coagulation equation for settling dust particles. The level populations and\nline emission of molecular hydrogen are calculated using the derived physical\nstructure of the disks. X-ray irradiation is the dominant heating source of the\ngas in the inner disk region and in the surface layer, while the far UV heating\ndominates otherwise. If the central star has strong X-ray and weak UV\nradiation, the H2 level populations are controlled by X-ray pumping, and the\nX-ray induced transition lines could be observable. If the UV irradiation is\nstrong, the level populations are controlled by thermal collisions or UV\npumping, depending on the properties of the dust grains in the disks. As the\ndust particles evolve in the disks, the gas temperature at the disk surface\ndrops because the grain photoelectric heating becomes less efficient, while the\nUV radiation fields become stronger due to the decrease of grain opacity.

The\ngoal of this paper is to analyse the characteristics of the cognitive\nmechanisms, the knowledge and the representations involved in the code reuse\nactivity performed by experienced programmers. More generally, the focus is the\ncontrol structure of the reuse activity. Data collected in an experiment in\nwhich programmers had to design programs are analyzed. Two code reuse\nsituations are distinguished depending on whether or not the processes involved\nin reuse start before the elaboration of what acts as a source-solution. Our\nanalysis highlights the use of reasoning from a schema and from an analog in\nthe code reuse activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jan 2007 16:41:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This feature indicates that, for the\nFerraris-Kijowski model to be physical, there must exist a background field\nthat depends on the Ricci tensor. The simplest possibility, supported by recent\nastronomical observations, is the cosmological constant, generated in the\npurely affine formulation of gravity by the Eddington Lagrangian. In this paper\nwe combine the electromagnetic field and the cosmological constant in the\npurely affine formulation. We show that the sum of the two affine (Eddington\nand Ferraris-Kijowski) Lagrangians is dynamically inequivalent to the sum of\nthe analogous ($\\Lambda$CDM and Einstein-Maxwell) Lagrangians in the\nmetric-affine/metric formulation.

Therefore the purely affine formulation that combines\ngravity, electromagnetism and cosmological constant cannot be a simple sum of\naffine terms corresponding separately to these fields.

The effect of various coherence control techniques, i.e. fractional\nStimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage and Coherent Population Return on the\ncoherence are investigated. These techniques are implemented using nearly\ndegenerate pump and Stokes lasers at 795nm (Rubidium D1 transition) which\ncouple the two hyperfine ground states via the excited state |5P_{1/2}, F=1>\nthrough a resonant two-photon process, in which a coherent superposition of the\ntwo hyperfine ground states is established. The medium is probed by an\nadditional weak laser, which generates a four-wave mixing signal proportional\nto the ground state coherence, and allows us to monitor its evolution in time.\nThe experimental data are compared with numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jan 2007 22:10:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Harmonic perturbation is a rare special\ncase of time-dependent perturbations in which exact analysis exists. Some\nimportant technology advances, such as masers, lasers, nuclear magnetic\nresonance, etc., originated from it. Here we add quantum computation to this\nlist with a theoretical demonstration. Based on harmonic perturbation, a\nquantum mechanical algorithm is devised to search the ground state of a given\nHamiltonian. The intrinsic complexity of the algorithm is continuous and\nparametric in both time T and energy E. More precisely, the probability of\nlocating a search target of a Hamiltonian in N-dimensional vector space is\nshown to be 1/(1+ c N E^{-2} T^{-2}) for some constant c. This result is\noptimal. As harmonic perturbation provides a different computation mechanism,\nthe algorithm may suggest new directions in realizing quantum computers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Feb 2007 07:18:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Sep 2007 15:50:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-01"}
