The hard X-ray\nemission, believed to be associated with the collision of Eta Carinae's wind\nwith the wind from a massive companion star, varied strongly in flux on\ntimescales of days, but not significantly on timescales of hours.

The slope of the X-ray continuum\nabove 5 keV did not vary in any observation, which suggests that the electron\ntemperature of the hottest plasma associated with the stellar source did not\nvary significantly at any phase. Through the minimum, the absorption to the\nstellar source increased by a factor of 5-10 to NH ~3-4E23 cm-2.

A significant contribution to this study was provided by\nROSAT in 1990's. The outstanding capabilities of the currently operating\nobservatories, Chandra and XMM-Newton, have greatly increased the potential to\nobserve and analyze thermal radiation from the neutron star surfaces.\nConfronting observational data with theoretical models of thermal emission,\npresumably formed in neutron star atmospheres, allows one to infer the surface\ntemperatures, magnetic fields, chemical composition, and neutron star masses\nand radii. This information, supplemented with model equations of state and\nneutron star cooling models, provides an opportunity to understand the\nfundamental properties of the superdense matter in the neutron star interiors.\nI review the current status and most important results obtained from modeling\nneutron star thermal emission and present selected Chandra and XMM-Newton\nresults on thermal radiation from various types of these objects: ordinary\nradio pulsars with ages ranging from about 2 kyr to 20 Myr (J1119-6127, Vela,\nB1706-44, J0538+2817, B2334+61, B0656+14, B1055-52, Geminga, B0950+08,\nJ2043+2740), millisecond pulsars (J0030+0451, J2124-3358, J1024-0719,\nJ0437-4715), putative pulsars (CXOU J061705.3+222127, RX J0007.0+7302), central\ncompact objects in supernova remnats (in particular, 1E 1207.4-5209), and\nisolated radio-quiet neutron stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2007 01:58:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-12"}

For that purpose we have collected together, and\ncompleted when necessary, the various analysis we have previously made\nseparately for early and late types. We find strong photometric and kinematic\nevidence of pseudobulges in the S0-S0/a galaxies: their bulges are on average\nfairly exponential, inner disks are common (in 56%), and in many of the\ngalaxies the bulges are rotationally supported. This would be difficult to\nunderstand in such gas poor galaxies as in S0s, if these pseudobulge candidates\nwere formed by star formation in the disk in a a similar manner as in spirals.\nA more likely explanation is that pseudobulges in the early-type galaxies are\nbar-related structures, connected to the evolution of bars, which\ninterpretation is supported by our Fourier analysis and structural\ndecompositions. Bars in the early-type galaxies are found to have many\ncharacteristics of evolved systems: (1) they have flat-top/double peaked\nFourier amplitude profiles, (2) bars have typically sharp outer cut-offs, (3)\nthe higher Fourier modes appear in the amplitude profiles, and (4) many bars\nhave also ansae-type morphologies.

The\nphysical ingredients behind the predictions are essentially classical:\nSuper-critical nuclei are created at the Zeldovich rate, and before the\ndepletion of monomers is significant, the characteristic cluster size is so\nlarge that the clusters undergo diffusion limited growth. Mathematically, the\ndistribution of cluster sizes satisfies an advection PDE in \"size-space\".\nDuring this creation phase, clusters are nucleated and then grow to a size much\nlarger than the critical size, so nucleation of super-critical clusters at the\nZeldovich rate is represented by an effective boundary condition at zero size.\nThe advection PDE subject to the effective boundary condition constitutes a\n\"creation signaling problem\" for the evolving distribution of cluster sizes\nduring the creation era.\n  Dominant balance arguments applied to the advection signaling problem show\nthat the characteristic time and cluster size of the creation era are\nexponentially large in the initial free-energy barrier against nucleation, G_*.\nSpecifically, the characteristic time is proportional to exp(2 G_*/ 5 k_B T)\nand the characteristic number of monomers in a cluster is proportional to\nexp(3G_*/5 k_B T). The exponentially large characteristic time and cluster size\ngive a-posteriori validation of the mathematical signaling problem.

Spontaneous polarization decreases with increasing pressure so that the\n$R3c$ phase transforms to the centrosymmetric $R\\bar{3}c$ phase at around 30\nGPa. The first-order phase transition between tetragonal and rhombohedral phase\nis exceptional since there is no evidence for a bridging phase. The essential\nfeature of the $R3c$ and $R\\bar{3}c$ phases is that they allow the oxygen\noctahedron to increase its volume $V_B$ at the expense of cuboctahedral volume\n$V_A$ around a Pb ion. This is further supported by the fact that neither the\n$R3m$ nor $Cm$ phase, which keep the $V_A/V_B$ ratio constant, is a ground\nstate within the pressure range between 0 and 40 GPa. Thus tetragonal strain is\ndominant up to 9 GPa, whereas at higher pressures efficient compression through\noxygen octahedra tilting plays the central role for PbTiO$_3$.

Because of its physical properties, salt, a surrogate for\nnatural faults, allows for friction and plastic deformation and pressure\nsolution creep to be efficient on the same timescale. During the same\nexperiment, we observe a continuous change of the frictional behaviour of the\nslider under constant conditions of stiffness, temperature and loading\nvelocity. The stick-slip regime is progressively vanishing, eventually reaching\nthe stable sliding regime. Concomitantly, the contact interface, observed under\nthe microscope, develops a striated morphology with contact asperities increase\nin length and width, arguing for an increase in the critical slip distance dc.\nComplementary experiments including velocity jumps show that the frictional\nparameters of the rate and state friction law, a and b, progressively vanish\nwith the cumulative slip. In our experimental conditions, the ultimate stage of\nfriction is therefore rate and state independent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2007 15:19:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

The first two methods keep the\npropagation constants fixed, while the third method keeps the powers (or other\narbitrary functionals) of the solution fixed. It is proved that all these\nmethods are guaranteed to converge to any solitary wave (either ground state or\nnot) as long as the initial condition is sufficiently close to the\ncorresponding exact solution, and the time step in the iteration schemes is\nbelow a certain threshold value. Furthermore, these schemes are\nfast-converging, highly accurate, and easy to implement.

Common examples are\ntrajectories of ionic flux through individual membrane-channels, and of photon\ncounts collected from diffusion, activity, and conformational changes of\nbiopolymers. By analyzing the trajectory, one wishes to deduce the underlying\nmechanism, which is usually described by a multi-substate kinetic scheme. In\nprevious works, we divided kinetic schemes that generate two-state trajectories\ninto two types: reducible schemes and irreducible schemes. We showed that all\nthe information in trajectories generated from reducible schemes is contained\nin the waiting time probability density functions (PDFs) of the two states. It\nfollows that reducible schemes with the same waiting time PDFs are not\ndistinguishable.

We show that the binned successive waiting times PDF is\nnot only more robust than other functions when analyzing finite trajectories,\nbut contains, in most cases, more information about the underlying kinetic\nscheme than other functions in the limit of infinitely long trajectories.
