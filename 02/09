Deep CCD photometry in the BVI pass-bands obtained with the VLT\nis used to improve the quality of the CMD and to determine the cluster's\nluminosity function and surface density profile. High-resolution spectrograms\nobtained with Magellan are used to measure the cluster's radial velocity and to\nplace limits on its possible metallicity. The measurements of distance and\nradial velocity are used to test the cluster's membership in the stellar\nstreams from the Sgr dSph. From our CMD of Whiting 1, we derive new estimates\nfor the cluster's age (6.5 Gyrs), metallicity ([Fe/H]=-0.65), and distance\n(29.4 kpc). From echelle spectrograms of three stars, we obtain -130.6 km/s for\nthe cluster's radial velocity and show from measurements of two infra-red CaII\nlines that the [Fe/H] of the cluster probably lies in the range -1.1 to -0.4.\nWe demonstrate that the position of Whiting 1 on the sky, its distance from the\nSun, and its radial velocity are identical to within the errors of both the\ntheoretical predictions of the trailing stream of stars from the Sgr dSph\ngalaxy and the previous observations of the M giant stars that delineate the\nstreams.

The gas is self-gravitating and\nrotating, and is the seat of nuclear heating, and heat diffusion is due to\nradiative diffusion with Kramers type opacities.

We show that an approximately\nGaussian mass function is naturally generated from a power-law mass\ndistribution of protoglobular clouds by expulsion from the protocluster of star\nforming gas due to supernova activity, provided that the power-law mass\ndistribution shows a lower-mass limit. As a result of gas loss, the\ngravitational potential of the protocluster gets weaker and only a fraction of\nthe newly formed stars is retained. The mass fraction of bound stars ranges\nfrom zero to unity, depending on the local star formation efficiency\n$\\epsilon$. Assuming that $\\epsilon$ is independent of the protoglobular cloud\nmass, we investigate how such variations affect the mapping of a protoglobular\ncloud mass function to the resulting globular cluster initial mass function. A\ntruncated power-law cloud mass spectrum generates bell-shaped cluster initial\nmass functions, with a turnover location mostly sensitive to the lower limit of\nthe cloud mass range. We also show that a Gaussian mass function for the\nprotoglobular clouds with a mean ${\\rm log}m_G \\simeq 6.1-6.2$ and a standard\ndeviation $\\sigma \\lesssim 0.4$ provides results very similar to those\nresulting from a truncated power-law cloud mass spectrum, that is, the\ndistribution function of masses of protoglobular clouds influences only weakly\nthe shape of the resulting globular star cluster initial mass function. The gas\nremoval process and the protoglobular cloud mass-scale dominate the relevant\nphysics.

A Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation from 'Nambu'-doubled\nsuper-fields leads to a generating function with super-matrices for the\nself-energy whose manifold is given by the ortho-symplectic super-group\nOsp(S,S|2L). Effective equations are derived for anomalous terms which are\nrelated to the molecular- and BCS- condensate pairs. A change of integration\nmeasure for the coset decomposition Osp(S,S|2L)/U(L|S)xU(L|S) is performed,\nincluding a separation of density and anomalous parts of the self-energy with a\ngradient expansion for the Goldstone modes. The independent anomalous fields in\nthe actions can be transformed by the inverse square root of the metric tensor\nof Osp(S,S|2L)/U(L|S) so that the coset integration measure with the\nsuper-Jacobi-determinant can be removed from the coherent state path integral\nand Gaussian-like integrations remain. The variations of the independent coset\nfields in the effective actions result in classical field equations for a\nnonlinear sigma model with the anomalous terms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 2007 20:45:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Feb 2007 18:33:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 30 May 2007 17:37:21 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 26 Aug 2007 10:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

In humans, an efficient system\nfor the processing of own species faces exists. This specialization is achieved\nthrough experience with faces of conspecifics during development and leads to\nthe loss of ability to process faces from other primate species. We hypothesize\nthat a similar mechanism exists in social primates. We investigated face\nprocessing in one Old World species (genus Macaca) and in one New World species\n(genus Cebus). Our results show the same advantage for own species face\nrecognition for all tested subjects. This work suggests in all species tested\nthe existence of a common trait inherited from the primate ancestor: an\nefficient system to identify individual faces of own species only.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Feb 2007 14:27:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

However, in some species, decision-making\nincludes negotiations and distributed leadership. These facts suggest that\nsimple underlying processes may explain certain decision mechanisms during\ncollective movements. To study such processes, we have designed experiments on\nwhite-faced capuchin monkeys (Cebus capucinus) during which we provoked\ncollective movements involving a binary choice. These experiments enabled us to\nanalyse the spatial decisions of individuals in the group.We found that the\nunderlying process includes anonymous mimetism, which means that each\nindividual may influence all members of the group. To support this result, we\ncreated a mathematical model issued from our experimental data. A totally\nanonymous model does not fit perfectly with our experimental distribution. A\nmore individualised model, which takes into account the specific behaviour of\nsocial peripheral individuals, revealed the validity of the mimetism\nhypothesis. Even though white-faced capuchins have complex cognitive abilities,\na coexistence of anonymous and social mechanisms appears to influence their\nchoice of direction during collective movements. The present approach may offer\nvital insights into the relationships between individual behaviours and their\nemergent collective acts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Feb 2007 15:15:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
