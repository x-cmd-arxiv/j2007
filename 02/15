The absorber consists\nof two different ionization components. By tracking the response in the opacity\nof the gas in each component to changes in the ionizing continuum, we were able\nto constrain the electron density of the system. The measured densities require\nthat the high and low ionization absorbing components of NGC 4051 must be\ncompact, at distances 0.5-1.0 l-d (2200 - 4400Rs) and < 3.5 l-d (< 15800Rs)\nfrom the continuum source, respectively. This rules out an origin in the dusty\nobscuring torus, as the dust sublimation radius is at least an order of\nmagnitude larger (>12 l-d). An accretion disk origin for the warm absorber wind\nis strongly suggested, and an association with the high ionization, HeII\nemitting, broad emission line region (radius <2 l-d) is possible. The two\ndetected phases are consistent with pressure equilibrium, which suggests that\nthe absorber consists of a two phase medium. A radial flow in a spherical\ngeometry is unlikely, and a conical wind geometry is preferred. The implied\nmass outflow rate from this wind, can be well constrained, and is 2-5% of the\nmass accretion rate. If the mass outflow rate scaling with accretion rate is\nrepresentative of all quasars, our results imply that warm absorbers in\npowerful quasars are unlikely to produce important evolutionary effects on\ntheir larger environment, unless we are observing the winds before they get\nfully accelerated. Only in such a scenario can AGN winds be important for\ncosmic feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Feb 2007 00:28:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-11"}

In the present analysis, these problems\nare addressed by non-linear modelling of radial pulsations of these stars. In\nthis approach radial modes are treated as representative for all acoustic\noscillations.\n  Several models of different masses and metallicities were converged to limit\ncycles through Stellingwerf (1974) relaxation technique. Resulting peak-to-peak\namplitudes are of order of DeltaV=0.3 mag. Such amplitudes are significantly\nlarger than those observed in beta Cephei pulsators. Assuming that all acoustic\nmodes are similar, we show that collective saturation of the driving mechanism\nby several acoustic modes can easily lower predicted saturation amplitudes to\nthe observed level. Our calculations predict significant decrease of saturation\namplitudes as we go to high mass/high luminosity models. However, this effect\nis not strong enough to explain scarcity of high mass beta Cephei variables.\n  We also discuss robust double-mode behaviour, encountered in our radiative\nmodels. On a single evolutionary track we identify two double-mode domains with\ntwo different mechanisms resposible for double-mode behaviour.

Our main\nresult is that the closure of $T(y)$ in the $\\ell_1$ norm can be fully\ndescribed by inequalities on the $\\ell_p$ norms: $\\|x\\|_p \\leq \\|y\\|_p$ for all\n$p \\geq 1$. This is a first step towards a complete description of $T(y)$\nitself. It can also be seen as a $\\ell_p$-norm analogue of Ky Fan dominance\ntheorem about unitarily invariant norms. The proofs exploits links with another\nquantum phenomenon: the possibiliy of multiple-copy transformations\n($x^{\\otimes n} \\prec y^{\\otimes n}$ for given $n$).
