We start from a\ngauge-invariant conjecture for the infrared-dominant part of S, based on\ndynamical generation of a gluon mass M in d=4. We argue that the exact leading\nterm, of O(M), in an expansion of S in inverse powers of M is a d=3\ngauge-invariant mass term (gauged non-linear sigma model); the next leading\nterm, of O(1/M), is a conventional Yang-Mills action. The d=3 action that is\nthe sum of these two terms has center vortices as classical solutions. The d=3\ngluon mass, which we constrain to be the same as M, and d=3 coupling are\nrelated through the conjecture to the d=4 coupling strength, but at the same\ntime the dimensionless ratio in d=3 of mass to coupling squared can be\nestimated from d=3 dynamics. This allows us to estimate the QCD coupling\n$\\alpha_s(M^2)$ in terms of this strictly d=3 ratio; we find a value of about\n0.4, in good agreement with an earlier theoretical value but a little low\ncompared to QCD phenomenology. The wave functional for d=2+1 QCD has an\nexponent that is a d=2 infrared-effective action having both the\ngauge-invariant mass term and the field strength squared term, and so differs\nfrom the conventional QCD action in two dimensions, which has no mass term.\nThis conventional d=2 QCD would lead in d=3 to confinement of all color-group\nrepresentations.

In this paper, a dynamical model is proposed to describe the\nspatio-temporal intermittency of energy dissipation rate in a turbulent system.\nThis is done by using a shell model to simulate the turbulent cascade and\nintroducing some heuristic rules, partly inspired by the well known $p$-model,\nto construct a spatial structure of the energy dissipation rate. In order to\nvalidate the model and to study its spatially intermittency properties, a\nseries of numerical simulations have been performed. These show that the level\nof spatial intermittency of the system can be simply tuned by varying a single\nparameter of the model and that scaling laws in agreement with those obtained\nfrom experiments on fully turbulent hydrodynamic flows can be recovered. It is\nfinally suggested that the model could represent a useful tool to simulate the\nspatio-temporal intermittency of turbulent energy dissipation in those high\nReynolds number astrophysical fluids where impulsive energy release processes\ncan be associated to the dynamics of the turbulent cascade.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 2007 15:46:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Recent experiments suggest that ATP\nbinding to the leading head domain in kinesin is regulated by the rearward\nstrain built on the neck-linker.

The network of native contacts obtained from\nthis comparison provides the internal tension propagation pathway, which leads\nto the disruption of the nucleotide binding site in the leading head.

However, in some domains\n(most notably, in computational physics and quantum computing) the nature of\nthe relevant uncertainty is non-classical, and the laws of classical\nprobability theory are superseded by those of quantum mechanics. In this paper\nwe introduce Markovian Entanglement Networks (MEN), a novel class of graphical\nrepresentations of quantum-mechanical dependencies in the context of such\nnon-classical systems. MEN are the quantum-mechanical analogue of Markovian\nNetworks, a family of undirected graphical representations which, in the\nclassical domain, exploit a notion of conditional independence among\nsubsystems.\n  After defining a notion of conditional independence appropriate to our domain\n(conditional separability), we prove that the conditional separabilities\ninduced by a quantum-mechanical wave function are effectively reflected in the\ngraphical structure of MEN. Specifically, we show that for any wave function\nthere exists a MEN which is a perfect map of its conditional separabilities.\nNext, we show how the graphical structure of MEN can be used to effectively\nclassify the pure states of three-qubit systems. We also demonstrate that, in\nlarge systems, exploiting conditional independencies may dramatically reduce\nthe computational burden of various inference tasks. In principle, the\ngraph-theoretic representation of conditional independencies afforded by MEN\nmay not only facilitate the classical simulation of quantum systems, but also\nprovide a guide to the efficient design and complexity analysis of quantum\nalgorithms and circuits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Feb 2007 18:39:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-09"}
