To linear order, vorticity waves\nare swung around by the background shear, and their velocities are amplified\ntransiently before decaying. It has been speculated that sufficiently amplified\nmodes might couple nonlinearly, leading to turbulence. Here we show how\nnonlinear coupling occurs in two dimensions. This coupling is remarkably simple\nbecause it only lasts for a short time interval, when one of the coupled modes\nis in mid-swing. We focus on the interaction between a swinging and an\naxisymmetric mode. There is instability provided that k_{y,swing}/k_{x,axi} <\nomega/q, i.e., that the ratio of wavenumbers is less than the ratio of the\naxisymmetric mode's vorticity to the background vorticity. If this is the case,\nthen when the swinging mode is in mid-swing it couples with the axisymmetric\nmode to produce a new leading swinging mode that has larger vorticity than\nitself; this new mode in turn produces an even larger leading mode, etc.\nTherefore all axisymmetric modes, regardless of how small in amplitude, are\nunstable to perturbations with sufficiently large azimuthal wavelength. We show\nthat this shear instability occurs whenever the momentum transported by a\nperturbation has the sign required for it to diminish the background shear;\nonly when this occurs can energy be extracted from the mean flow and hence\nadded to the perturbation. For an accretion disk, this means that the\ninstability transports angular momentum outwards while it operates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Feb 2007 16:19:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Aug 2007 18:25:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Such strong\nfields are expected to be generated by a coherent alpha-Omega dynamo in the\nearly seconds after the Neutron Star formation, if its spin period is of a few\nmilliseconds at most. A substantial deformation of the NS is caused by such\nfields and a newborn millisecond-spinning magnetar would thus radiate for a few\ndays a strong gravitational wave signal.

This is at variance with what\nwould be expected if the spin energy of the young, millisecond NS were radiated\naway as electromagnetic radiation andd/or relativistic particle winds and,\nthus, transferred quickly to the expanding gas shell.

While it is clear that the ultimate\ncause of any difference between quiet sun and plage is the presence of magnetic\nfields of order 100 G in the latter, the mechanism by which the magnetic field\nexerts its influence has not yet been conclusively identified. One possible\nsuch mechanism is suggested by the observation that granular motions in plage\nareas tend to be slightly ``abnormal'', dampened compared to quiet sun.\n  In this paper we consider the effect that abnormal granulation observed in\nactive regions should have on the propagation of acoustic waves. Any such\neffect is found to be limited to a shallow surface layer where sound waves\npropagate nearly vertically. The magnetically suppressed turbulence implies\nhigher sound speeds, leading to shorter travel times.

As a consequence of the variation of the\nacoustic cutoff with height, Dt is expected to be significantly higher for\nhigher frequency waves within the observed regime of 3-5 mHz.

We are particularly interested in the celebrated question of blowup\nin finite time of the solution gradient of the SQG equations. The new\nregularization yields a necessary and sufficient condition, satisfied by the\nregularized solution, when a regularization parameter $\\alpha$ tends to zero,\nfor the solution of the original SQG equations to develop a singularity in\nfinite time. As opposed to the commonly used viscous regularization, the\ninviscid equations derived here conserve a modified energy. Therefore, the new\nregularization provides an attractive numerical procedure for finite time blow\nup testing. In particular, we prove that, if the initial condition is smooth,\nthen the regularized solution remains as smooth as the initial data for all\ntimes. Moreover, much like the original problem, the inviscid regularization\nadmits a maximum principle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Feb 2007 07:31:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Here, we show that, even for arbitrary\nlarge economies when the distribution of the capitalization of firms is\nsufficiently heavy-tailed as is the case of real economies, there may exist a\nnew source of significant systematic risk, which has been totally neglected up\nto now but must be priced by the market. This new source of risk can readily\nexplain several asset pricing anomalies on the sole basis of the\ninternal-consistency of the market model. For this, we derive a theoretical\ntwo-factor model for asset pricing which has empirically a similar explanatory\npower as the Fama-French three-factor model. In addition to the usual market\nrisk, our model accounts for a diversification risk, proxied by the\nequally-weighted portfolio, and which results from an ``internal consistency\nfactor'' appearing for arbitrary large economies, as a consequence of the\nconcentration of the market portfolio when the distribution of the\ncapitalization of firms is sufficiently heavy-tailed as in real economies.
