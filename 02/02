In this paper, we study\nhow Cuscuton modifies the constraint sector of Einstein gravity. In particular,\nwe study Cuscuton cosmology and show that even though Cuscuton can have an\narbitrary equation of state, or time dependence, and is thus inhomogeneous; its\nperturbations do not introduce any additional dynamical degree of freedom and\nonly satisfy a constraint equation, amounting to an effective modification of\ngravity on large scales. Therefore, Cuscuton can be considered to be a minimal\ntheory of evolving dark energy, or a minimal modification of a cosmological\nconstant, as it has no internal dynamics. Moreover, this is the only\nmodification of Einstein gravity to our knowledge that does not introduce any\nadditional degrees freedom (and is not conformally equivalent to the Einstein\ngravity). We then study two simple Cuscuton models, with quadratic and\nexponential potentials. The quadratic model has the exact same expansion\nhistory as LCDM, and yet contains an early dark energy component with constant\nenergy fraction, which is constrained to < 2%, mainly from WMAP Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (CMB) and SDSS Lyman-alpha forest observations. The\nexponential model has the same expansion history as the DGP self-accelerating\nbraneworld model, but generates a much smaller Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW)\neffect, and is thus consistent with the CMB observations. Finally, we show that\nthe evolution is local on super-horizon scales, implying that there is no gross\nviolation of causality, despite Cuscuton's infinite speed of sound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Feb 2007 19:50:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 May 2007 22:34:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

In this paper, we\npresent a new mass modelling formalism for ellipticals that invokes no\nobservations other than the central velocity dispersion ($\\sigma_0$) and\nphotometry. The essence of the method lies in choosing a local mass-to-light\nratio ($M/L$) profile for a galaxy, with which the deprojected luminosity\ndensity distribution (along the major axis coordinate $x$) is scaled. The\nresulting discontinuous mass density profile is then smoothed, according to a\nlaid out prescription; the local $M/L$ profile that stems from this smoothed\nmass density, is found to be significantly different from the raw $M/L$\ndistribution. A suite of model galaxies (both Sersic and cored in nature) is\nused for extensive experimentation in order to characterise this raw $M/L$\nprofile and in each case, the mass density recovered from this mass modelling\ntechnique is compared to the known mass distribution. We opt to work with a raw\n$M/L$ profile that is a simple two-stepped function of $x$, with a low inner\nand higher outer value of $M/L-\\Upsilon_{in}$ and $\\Upsilon_{out}$,\nrespectively. The only constraint that we have on this profile is in the centre\nof the galaxy, via $\\sigma_0$. This value of $\\sigma_0$ is implemented in the\nvirial theorem to obtain an estimate of the central $M/L$ ratio of the galaxy.\nThe fallibility of the virial mass estimate is taken care of, by allowing for a\nrange in the values of $\\Upsilon_{in}$ that can be used for a given galaxy\nmodel. Moreover, our experiments indicate that $\\Upsilon_{out}$ is uniquely\nknown, for a given $\\Upsilon_{in}$; for cored galaxies, this functional form is\nfound uniquely dependant on the core radius. The jump radius of the raw $M/L$\nprofile is chosen to be thrice the effective radius of the galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Feb 2007 13:21:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The role of `structural memory' (the\ndependence of structural parameters such as the micellar length distribution on\nthe flow history) in explaining these highly nonlinear phenomena is addressed.\nStructural memory also plays an intriguing role in the little-understood\nshear-thickening regime, which occurs in a concentration regime close to but\nbelow the onset of strong entanglement, and which is marked by a shear-induced\ntransformation from an inviscid to a gelatinous state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Feb 2007 14:55:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A key goal is to\nminimize the amount of bandwidth used to maintain that redundancy. Storing a\nfile using an erasure code, in fragments spread across nodes, promises to\nrequire less redundancy and hence less maintenance bandwidth than simple\nreplication to provide the same level of reliability. However, since fragments\nmust be periodically replaced as nodes fail, a key question is how to generate\na new fragment in a distributed way while transferring as little data as\npossible across the network.\n  In this paper, we introduce a general technique to analyze storage\narchitectures that combine any form of coding and replication, as well as\npresenting two new schemes for maintaining redundancy using erasure codes.\nFirst, we show how to optimally generate MDS fragments directly from existing\nfragments in the system. Second, we introduce a new scheme called Regenerating\nCodes which use slightly larger fragments than MDS but have lower overall\nbandwidth use. We also show through simulation that in realistic environments,\nRegenerating Codes can reduce maintenance bandwidth use by 25 percent or more\ncompared with the best previous design--a hybrid of replication and erasure\ncodes--while simplifying system architecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Feb 2007 06:55:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-13"}

The\ncoefficients of the spatial derivative terms of the phonon effective Lagrangian\nare related to the elastic moduli of the crystal; the coefficients that encode\nthe linear response of the crystal to a shearing stress define the shear\nmodulus.

In arXiv:0708.2176, we\nintroduced the link-space formalism for analysing degree-degree correlations in\nevolving networks. In this extended version, we provide additional mathematical\ndetails and supplementary material.\n  We explore some of the common oversights when these correlations are not\ntaken into account, highlighting the importance of the formalism. The formalism\nis based on a statistical description of the fraction of links l_{i,j}\nconnecting nodes of degrees i and j. To demonstrate its use, we apply the\nframework to some pedagogical network models, namely, random-attachment,\nBarabasi-Albert preferential attachment and the classical Erdos and Renyi\nrandom graph. For these three models the link-space matrix can be solved\nanalytically.

In social dilemma games with a fixed\npopulation size, heterogeneity in the number of contacts per player is known to\npromote evolution of cooperation. Under a common assumption of positively\nbiased payoff structure, well-connected players earn much by playing\nfrequently, and cooperation once adopted by well-connected players is\nunbeatable and spreads to others. However, maintaining a social contact can be\ncostly, which would prevent local payoffs from being positively biased. In\nreplicator-type evolutionary dynamics, it is shown that even a relatively small\nparticipation cost extinguishes the merit of heterogeneous networks in terms of\ncooperation. In this situation, more connected players earn less so that they\nare no longer spreaders of cooperation. Instead, those with fewer contacts win\nand guide the evolution.
