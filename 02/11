In this\nframework, GCs are assumed to originate in forming low-mass dwarfs embedded in\ndark matter subhalos at very high redshifts (z) and thus be chemically\ninfluenced by field AGB stars of the dwarfs during early GC formation\nprocesses. In this external pollution scenario, the ratio of the total mass of\ninfalling gas to that of AGB ejecta during GC formation in a dwarf (s) and the\ntime scale of gas infall (sigma_I) are the most important key parameters that\ncan determine abundance properties of GCs. We mainly investigate the abundance\ninhomogeneity among light elements (e.g., C, N, O, Na, and Al) of stars in GCs\nby using the latest stellar yield models of metal-poor AGB stars with and\nwithout third dredge-up. Our principal results for the models with no third\ndredge-up, which are more consistent with observations, are as follows.\n  Both [N/Fe] and [C/Fe] can be diverse among stars within a GC owing to\nchemical pollution from field AGB stars. [N/Fe] distributions in some GCs can\nclearly show bimodality whereas [C/Fe] is monomodal in most models. [N/Fe]\ndistributions depend on s such that models with smaller $s$ (i.e., larger mass\nfraction of AGB ejecta used for GC formation) show the [N/Fe] bimodality more\nclearly. N-rich, C-poor stars in GCs also have higher He abundances owing to\npollution from massive AGB stars with He-rich ejecta.

These chaotic fields generate potentials for\nmoduli fields, which ultimately fix the fundamental parameters. The chaotic\ndynamics can be physically interpreted in terms of vacuum fluctuations.

The vacuum energy generated by the\nchaotic fields underlies the currently observed dark energy of the universe.\nOur theory correctly predicts the numerical values of the electroweak and\nstrong coupling constants using a simple principle, the minimization of vacuum\nenergy.
