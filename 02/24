We find that this IC emission produces high energy\ngamma-ray flares, which may be detected by AGILE, GLAST and ground-based TeV\ntelescopes. The anisotropic IC scattering between flare photons and forward\nshock electrons does not affect the total IC component intensity, but cause a\ntime delay of the IC component peak relative to the flare peak. The anisotropic\nscattering effect may also weaken, to some extent, the suppression effect of\nthe afterglow intensity induced by the enhanced electron cooling due to flare\nphotons. We speculate that this IC component may already have been detected by\nEGRET from a very strong burst--GRB940217.

It is well established in stars of\nspectral types F--K and in M-type stars of young clusters. It is not\nestablished in field M-dwarfs, because they rotate very slowly, and detecting\nrotation periods or rotational line broadening is a challenge. In field\nM-dwarfs, saturation sets in below v_rot = 5 km/s, hence they are expected to\npopulate the non-saturated part of the rotation-activity connection. This work\nfor the first time shows intrinsically resolved spectral lines of slowly\nrotating M-dwarfs and makes a first comparison to estimates of convective\nvelocities. By measuring rotation velocities in a sample of mostly inactive\nM-dwarfs, the unsaturated part of the rotation-activity connection is followed\ninto the regime of very low activity. Spectra of ten M-dwarfs are taken at a\nresolving power of R = 200 000 in the molecular FeH absorption band. The\nintrinsically narrow lines are compared to model calculations and rotational\nbroadening is measured. In one star, an upper limit of vsini = 1 km/s was\nfound, significant rotation was detected in the other nine objects. All\ninactive stars show rotation below or equal to 2 km/s. In the two active stars\nAD Leo and YZ CMi, rotation velocities are found to be 40-50% below the results\nfrom earlier studies. The rotation activity connection holds in field early-M\nstars, too. Activity and rotation velocities of the sample stars are well in\nagreement with the relation found in earlier and younger stars. The intrinsic\nabsorption profiles of molecular FeH lines are consistent with calculations\nfrom atomic Fe lines.

A first order\noperator solution of the model Hamiltonian is used to study the possibilities\nof generation of higher order nonclassical states. It is found that the higher\norder squeezed and higher order antibunched states can be produced by this\ninteraction. It is also shown that the higher order nonclassical states may\nappear separately, i.e. a higher order antibunched state is not essentially\nhigher order squeezed state and vice versa.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Feb 2007 12:12:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-10"}
