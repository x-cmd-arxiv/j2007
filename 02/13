The observations of HDE 245770\ndocument the rapid spectral variability that apparently accompanied the\nregeneration of a new circumstellar disk. This disk grew rapidly during the\nyears 1998 - 2000, but then slowed in growth in subsequent years. The outer\ndisk radius is probably truncated by resonances between the disk gas and\nneutron star orbital periods. Two recent X-ray outbursts appear to coincide\nwith the largest disk half-maximum emission radius attained over the last\ndecade. Our observations of X Per indicate that its circumstellar disk has\nrecently grown to near record proportions, and concurrently the system has\ndramatically increased in X-ray flux, presumably the result of enhanced mass\naccretion from the disk. We find that the H-alpha half-maximum emission radius\nof the disk surrounding X Per reached a size about six times larger than the\nstellar radius, a value, however, that is well below the minimum separation\nbetween the Be star and neutron star.

The first goal is to show that high\nresolution angle-resolved photoelectron spectra from cuprates indicate the\npresence of string-like excitations of the quasihole excitation in a quantum\nantiferromagnet. In order to compare with the experimental intensity plots, we\ncalculate the spectral function of the t-J and the t-t'-t\"-J models within the\nself-consistent Born approximation for widely accepted values of the parameters\nof these models. The main features of the high resolution photoelectron spectra\nare in general agreement with the results based on the above models and can be\nunderstood by considering not only the lowest energy quasiparticle peak but,\nalso, the higher energy string-like excitations of the hole. The second goal of\nthe present paper is to make the case that a proper analysis of both the\nnumerical results obtained from these models and of the experimental results,\nsuggests a theoretical picture for the internal structure of the\nhole-quasiparticle and a string-exchange pairing mechanism due to strong\nantiferromagnetic correlations among the background spins. We find that, using\na simple model in which the Hilbert space is restricted to states of only\nunbroken strings attached to the holes and in which the holes are connected\nwith unbroken strings, we can provide a good quantitative description of the\nmost accurate numerical results. We find that the holes experience an effective\ninteraction due to a string-exchange mechanism which is characterized by a\nrather large string tension and this can provide pairing energy scales much\nlarger that those suggested by spin-fluctuation mediated pairing models. In\naddition, it is argued that such string-exchange interaction tends to bind\nholes in a bound state with the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 2007 20:38:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

All known algorithms for\nsolving this problem use a sort of exhaustive search in a particular finite set\nsuch as the super summit set and the ultra summit set. Their complexities are\nproportional to the size of the finite set, even when there exist very short\nconjugating elements. However, ultra summit sets are very large in some cases\nespecially for reducible braids and periodic braids. Some possible approaches\nto resolve this difficulty would be either to use different Garside structures\nand Garside groups in order to get a sufficiently small ultra summit set, or to\ndevelop an algorithm for finding a conjugating element faster than exhaustive\nsearch. Using the former method, Birman, Gonz\\'alez-Meneses and Gebhardt have\nproposed a polynomial-time algorithm for the CSP for periodic braids.\n  In this paper we study the conjugacy classes of periodic braids under the BKL\nGarside structure, and show that we can solve the CSP for periodic braids in\npolynomial time although their ultra summit sets are exponentially large.

While a great deal of the attention so far dedicated to complex\nnetworks has been duly driven by the `complex' nature of these structures, in\nthis work we address the identification of simplicity, in the sense of\nregularity, in complex networks. The basic idea is to seek for subgraphs\nexhibiting small dispersion (e.g. standard deviation or entropy) of local\nmeasurements such as the node degree and clustering coefficient. This approach\npaves the way for the identification of subgraphs (patches) with nearly uniform\nconnectivity, therefore complementing the characterization of the complexity of\nnetworks. We also performed analysis of cascade failures, revealing that the\nremoval of vertices in `simple' regions results in smaller damage to the\nnetwork structure than the removal of vertices in the heterogeneous regions. We\nillustrate the potential of the proposed methodology with respect to four\ntheoretical models as well as protein-protein interaction networks of three\ndifferent species. Our results suggest that the simplicity of protein\ninteraction grows as the result of natural selection. This increase in\nsimplicity makes these networks more robust to cascade failures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Feb 2007 12:28:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2008 19:48:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 29 Aug 2008 20:22:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-29"}

Given the framework of a measurement-based quantum computer, where\nquantum information is processed by local operations only, the most general\nuniversal one-way quantum computer is one which is capable of accepting\narbitrary classical inputs and producing arbitrary quantum outputs--we refer to\nthis property as CQ-universality. We then show that a systematic study of\nCQ-universality in one-way quantum computation is possible by identifying\nentanglement features that must be present in every universal resource. These\ninsights are used to identify several states as being not universal, such as 1D\ncluster states, W states, and ground states of non-critical 1D spin systems.\nOur criteria are strengthened by considering the efficiency of a quantum\ncomputation, and we find that entanglement measures must obey a certain scaling\nlaw with the system size for all efficient universal resources. This again\nleads to examples of non-universal resources, such as, e.g., ground states of\ncritical 1D spin systems. We also provide several examples of efficient\nuniversal resources, namely graph states corresponding to hexagonal, triangular\nand Kagome lattices. Finally, we consider the more general notion of encoded\nCQ-universality, where quantum outputs are allowed to be produced in an encoded\nform. Again we provide entanglement-based criteria for encoded universality.\nMoreover, we present a general procedure to construct encoded universal\nresources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 2007 22:01:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2007 09:33:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-31"}
