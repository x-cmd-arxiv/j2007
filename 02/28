I find that 80%\nof the bursts exhibit a linear correlation between their gamma-ray fluence and\nthe afterglow X-ray flux normalized to t=1 d, a proxy for the kinetic energy of\nthe blast wave ($F_{X,1}~F_{gamma}^1.01). An even tighter correlation is\nevident between E_{gamma,iso} and L_{X,1} for the subset of 13 bursts with\nmeasured or constrained redshifts. The remaining 20% of the bursts have values\nof F_{X,1}/F_{gamma} that are suppressed by about three orders of magnitude,\nlikely because of low circumburst densities (Nakar 2007). These results have\nseveral important implications: (i) The X-ray luminosity is generally a robust\nproxy for the blast wave kinetic energy, indicating nu_X>nu_c and hence a\ncircumburst density n>0.05 cm^{-3}; (ii) most short GRBs have a narrow range of\ngamma-ray efficiency, with <epsilon_{gamma}>~0.85 and a spread of 0.14 dex; and\n(iii) the isotropic-equivalent energies span 10^{48}-10^{52} erg. Furthermore,\nI find tentative evidence for jet collimation in the two bursts with the\nhighest E_{gamma,iso}, perhaps indicative of the same inverse correlation that\nleads to a narrow distribution of true energies in long GRBs. I find no clear\nevidence for a relation between the overall energy release and host galaxy\ntype, but a positive correlation with duration may be present, albeit with a\nlarge scatter. Finally, I note that the outlier fraction of 20% is similar to\nthe proposed fraction of short GRBs from dynamically-formed neutron star\nbinaries in globular clusters. This scenario may naturally explain the\nbimodality of the F_{X,1}/F_{gamma} distribution and the low circumburst\ndensities without invoking speculative kick velocities of several hundred km/s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Feb 2007 18:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Features associated with correlation appear to\ndevelop very differently in quantum dots than in bulk. The main reason is that\ntranslational symmetry is necessarily broken in a dot, leading to density\nmodulation and inhomogeneity. Electron-electron interactions act to enhance\nthis modulation ultimately leading to localization. This process appears to be\ncompletely smooth and occurs over a wide range of density. Thus there is a\nbroad regime of ``incipient'' Wigner crystallization in these quantum dots. Our\nspecific conclusions are: (i) The density develops sharp rings while the pair\ndensity shows both radial and angular inhomogeneity. (ii) The spin of the\nground state is consistent with Hund's (first) rule throughout our entire range\nof r_s for all 4<N<20. (iii) The addition energy curve first becomes smoother\nas interactions strengthen -- the mesoscopic fluctuations are damped by\ncorrelation -- and then starts to show features characteristic of the classical\naddition energy. (iv) Localization effects are stronger for a smaller number of\nelectrons. (v) Finally, the gap to certain spin excitations becomes small at\nthe strong interaction (large r_s) side of our regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Feb 2007 02:19:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Integrated in the joint design are three basic\ncomponents: a spectrum sensor that identifies spectrum opportunities, a sensing\nstrategy that determines which channels in the spectrum to sense, and an access\nstrategy that decides whether to access based on imperfect sensing outcomes.\n  We formulate the joint PHY-MAC design of OSA as a constrained partially\nobservable Markov decision process (POMDP). Constrained POMDPs generally\nrequire randomized policies to achieve optimality, which are often intractable.\nBy exploiting the rich structure of the underlying problem, we establish a\nseparation principle for the joint design of OSA. This separation principle\nreveals the optimality of myopic policies for the design of the spectrum sensor\nand the access strategy, leading to closed-form optimal solutions. Furthermore,\ndecoupling the design of the sensing strategy from that of the spectrum sensor\nand the access strategy, the separation principle reduces the constrained POMDP\nto an unconstrained one, which admits deterministic optimal policies.

Though there has been considerable\nwork on how to construct good perfect hash functions, there is a gap between\ntheory and practice among all previous methods on minimal perfect hashing. On\none side, there are good theoretical results without experimentally proven\npracticality for large key sets. On the other side, there are the theoretically\nanalyzed time and space usage algorithms that assume that truly random hash\nfunctions are available for free, which is an unrealistic assumption. In this\npaper we attempt to bridge this gap between theory and practice, using a number\nof techniques from the literature to obtain a novel scheme that is\ntheoretically well-understood and at the same time achieves an\norder-of-magnitude increase in performance compared to previous ``practical''\nmethods. This improvement comes from a combination of a novel, theoretically\noptimal perfect hashing scheme that greatly simplifies previous methods, and\nthe fact that our algorithm is designed to make good use of the memory\nhierarchy. We demonstrate the scalability of our algorithm by considering a set\nof over one billion URLs from the World Wide Web of average length 64, for\nwhich we construct a minimal perfect hash function on a commodity PC in a\nlittle more than 1 hour. Our scheme produces minimal perfect hash functions\nusing slightly more than 3 bits per key. For perfect hash functions in the\nrange $\\{0,...,2n-1\\}$ the space usage drops to just over 2 bits per key (i.e.,\none bit more than optimal for representing the key). This is significantly\nbelow of what has been achieved previously for very large values of $n$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Feb 2007 20:56:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The black\nhole - string phase transition is one of the fundamental properties of the\nnon-supersymmetric black holes in string theory, and we will reveal the nature\nof the phase transition from the exactly solvable world-sheet conformal field\ntheory viewpoint. Since the two-dimensional Lorentzian black hole system\n(SL(2;R)_k/U(1) coset model at level k) typically appears as near-horizon\ngeometries of various singularities such as NS5-branes in string theory, our\nresults can be regarded as the probe of such singularities from the\nnon-supersymmetric probe rolling D-brane. The exact construction of boundary\nstates for the rolling D0-brane falling down into the two-dimensional D-brane\nenables us to probe the phase transition at k=1 directly in the physical\namplitudes.

This is achieved by\nfirst identifying and removing links which close up feedback loops in the\noriginal network and hierarchically arranging nodes in the remaining network.\nIn mathematical language this corresponds to a problem of making a graph\nacyclic by removing as few links as possible and thus altering the original\ngraph in the least possible way. Practically in all applications the exact\nsolution of this problem requires an enumeration of all combinations of removed\nlinks, which is computationally intractable. We introduce and compare two\nalgorithms: the deterministic, 'greedy' algorithm that preferentially cuts the\nlinks that participate in the largest number of feedback cycles, and the\nprobabilistic one based on a simulated annealing of a hierarchical layout of\nthe network which minimizes the number of ``backward'' links going from lower\nto higher hierarchical levels. We find that the annealing algorithm outperforms\nthe deterministic one in terms of speed, memory requirement, and the actual\nnumber of removed links. Implications for system biology and directions for\nfurther research are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Feb 2007 17:07:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-15"}
