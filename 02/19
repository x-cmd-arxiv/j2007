We use a\nnon-parametric procedure to study the overall temporal properties of the flares\nand a structure function analysis to look for an evolution of the fundamental\nvariability time-scale between the prompt and late time emission. We find a\nstrong correlation in 28 individual x-ray flares in 18 separate GRBs between\nthe flare duration and their time of peak flux since the GRB trigger. We also\nfind a qualitative trend of decreasing variability as a function of time since\ntrigger, with a characteristic minimum variability timescale $\\Delta t/t=0.1$\nfor most flares. We interpret these results as evidence of internal shocks at\ncollision radii that are larger than those that produced the prompt emission.\nContemporaneous detections of high energy emission by GLAST could be a crucial\ntest in determining if indeed these X-ray flares originate as internal shocks\nbehind the afterglow, as any X-ray emission originating from behind the\nafterglow is expected to undergo inverse Compton scattering as it passes\nthrough the external shock.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Feb 2007 11:22:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2007 20:14:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Results: We report on 5 newly discovered\noutbursts from IGR J18483-0311 detected by INTEGRAL.For two of them it was\npossible to constrain a duration of the order of a few days. The strongest\noutburst reached a peak flux of 120 mCrab (20--100 keV): its broad band\nJEM--X/ISGRI spectrum (3--50 keV) is best fitted by an absorbed cutoff power\nlaw with photon index=1.4+/-0.3, cutoff energy of ~22 keV and Nh ~9x10^22\ncm^-2.

In agreement with recent numerical studies,\nit is found that a cluster (with mass M) hosting an IMBH (with mass M_BH)\nshows, outside the region of gravitational influence of the black hole, a\ncore-like profile resembling a King profile with concentration c < 2, although\nwith a slightly steeper behaviour in the core region.

The theory is valid over the whole\ntemperature plane and shows correct limiting MCT like behavior above $T_{c}$\nand goes over to the RFOT theory near the glass transition temperature,\n$T_{g}$. Between $T_{c}$ and $T_{g}$, the theory predicts that neither the\ncontinuous diffusion, described by pure mode coupling theory, nor the hopping\nmotion alone suffices but both contribute to the dynamics while interacting\nwith each other. We show that the interplay between the two contributions\nconspires to modify the relaxation behavior of the DSF from what would be\npredicted by a theory with a complete static Gaussian barrier distribution in a\nmanner that may be described as a facilitation effect. Close to $T_c$, coupling\nbetween the short time part of MCT dynamics and hopping reduces the stretching\ngiven by the F$_{12}$-MCT theory significantly and accelerates structural\nrelaxation. As the temperature is progressively lowered below $T_c$, the\nequations yield a crossover from MCT dominated regime to the hopping dominated\nregime. In the combined theory the dynamical heterogeneity is modified because\nthe low barrier components interact with the MCT dynamics to enhance the\nrelaxation rate below $T_c$ and reduces the stretching that would otherwise\narise from an input static barrier height distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Feb 2007 12:45:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Galileo argued that in a\nvacuum all bodies fall at the same rate relative to the earth, independent of\ntheir mass. Aristotle seemed to consider all media to be viscous, and argued\nthat heavier bodies fall faster. Aristotle was challenged by Philoponus, who\nargued that light and heavy weights fall about equally fast in air, eleven\nhundred years before Galileo. As we shall see, the problem is more subtle than\nmeets the eye -- even in a frictionless medium. Philoponus and Galileo are\nright part of the time, and Aristotle is partly right some of the time. In fact\nthey are all wrong the rest of the time, with the lightest body falling fastest\nwhen two bodies fall toward the earth. In principle the results of a free fall\nexperiment depend on whether falling masses originate on earth, are\nextraterrestrial, are sequential or concurrent, or are simultaneous for\ncoincident or separated bodies, etc. When single falling bodies originate from\nthe earth, all bodies (light and heavy) fall at the same rate relative to the\nearth in agreement with Galileo's view. Einstein's General Relativity (EGR), in\nwhich gravity is due to space-time curvature, was motivated by the Galilean\nnotion that free-fall is independent of the mass and properties of a falling\nbody, and is just due to the properties of the milieu it finds itself in.\nQuantum mechanics is found to violate the Equivalence Principle of EGR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Feb 2007 00:14:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Feb 2007 05:20:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2007 00:01:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 21 Mar 2009 23:57:28 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 28 Mar 2009 00:13:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-28"}

Thus, public-key cryptosystems in the quantum\ncomputational setting are longed for cryptology. In order to define the\nsecurity notions of public-key cryptosystems, we have to model the power of the\nsender, receiver, adversary and channel. While we may consider a setting where\nquantum computers are available only to adversaries, we generally discuss what\nare the right security notions for (quantum) public-key cryptosystems in the\nquantum computational setting. Moreover, we consider the security of quantum\npublic-key cryptosystems known so far.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Feb 2007 06:27:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This protocol allows unconditional\nsecurity in the presence of an eavesdropper, and the pair of linear codes is\nused for error correction and privacy amplification. Since their high decoding\nperformance implies low eavesdropper's mutual information, good design of the\ntwo codes is required. The proposed method admits using arbitrary low-density\nparity-check (LDPC) codes. Therefore, it has low complexity and high\nperformance for hardware implementation.
