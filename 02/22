Using the dispersion of polarization position\nangles, we find variations in the kinetic-to-magnetic energy density ratio of,\nat least, one order of magnitude along the I-front, with the magnetic pressure\ngenerally dominating over the turbulent motions. These findings suggest that\nthe magnetic component has a significant contribution to the dynamical balance\nof this region. Along the I-front, the mean magnetic field projected on the sky\nis [0.018 +/- 0.013]mG. The polarization efficiency seems to change along the\nI-front. We attribute high polarization efficiencies in regions of relatively\nlow extinction to an optimum degree of grain alignment.

We find that the effect\nof phonon scattering on device performance has a distinct bias dependence. Up\nto moderate gate biases the influence of high-energy OP scattering is\nsuppressed, and the device current is reduced due to elastic back-scattering by\nAP and low-energy RBM phonons. At large gate biases the current degradation is\nmainly due to high-energy OP scattering. The influence of both AP and\nhigh-energy OP scattering is reduced for larger diameter tubes. The effect of\nRBM mode, however, is nearly independent of the diameter for the tubes studied\nhere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Feb 2007 19:30:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We show that the problems of\nslope-function estimation, and of prediction from an estimator of the slope\nfunction, have very different characteristics.

In particular, the optimal mean-square convergence rate of\npredictors is $n^{-1}$, where $n$ denotes sample size, if the predictand is a\nsufficiently smooth function. In other cases, convergence occurs at a\npolynomial rate that is strictly slower than $n^{-1}$. At the boundary between\nthese two regimes, the mean-square convergence rate is less than $n^{-1}$ by\nonly a logarithmic factor. More generally, the rate of convergence of the\npredicted value of the mean response in the regression model, given a\nparticular value of the explanatory variable, is determined by a subtle\ninteraction among the smoothness of the predictand, of the slope function in\nthe model, and of the autocovariance function for the distribution of\nexplanatory variables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Feb 2007 12:42:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-13"}

Comparisons of the Gaussian based AF QMC results with exact full\nconfiguration show that the errors from controlling the phase problem with the\nphaseless approximation are small.

In\nPI, the progression of any given class depends on the outcome of real-time\nstudent feedback to ConcepTests: multiple-choice conceptual questions. In the\nearly 1990s, students responded to ConcepTests using flashcards showing their\nanswer. Instructors would then estimate the proportion of students holding each\nalternative conception. A few years later Mazur began using wireless handheld\ndevices - colloquially called clickers- to replace the flashcards. Previous\nusers of clickers in university classrooms had reported benefits such as\nincreased rates of attendance and decreased rates of attrition (Owens et al.,\n2004; Lopez-Herrejon & Schulman, 2004). This paper empirically measures the\nspecific contribution of clickers to conceptual learning and traditional\nproblem solving skills as compared to low-budget flashcards.
