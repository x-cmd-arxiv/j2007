With universal\nfrequency reuse and DS-CDMA transmission however, the ensuing cross-tier\ncochannel interference (CCI) causes unacceptable outage probability. This paper\ndevelops an uplink capacity analysis and interference avoidance strategy in\nsuch a two-tier CDMA network. We evaluate a network-wide area spectral\nefficiency metric called the \\emph{operating contour (OC)} defined as the\nfeasible combinations of the average number of active macrocell users and\nfemtocell base stations (BS) per cell-site that satisfy a target outage\nconstraint. The capacity analysis provides an accurate characterization of the\nuplink outage probability, accounting for power control, path-loss and\nshadowing effects. Considering worst case CCI at a corner femtocell, results\nreveal that interference avoidance through a time-hopped CDMA physical layer\nand sectorized antennas allows about a 7x higher femtocell density, relative to\na split spectrum two-tier network with omnidirectional femtocell antennas. A\nfemtocell exclusion region and a tier selection based handoff policy offers\nmodest improvements in the OCs.

While some RNAs are\nessential for embryogenesis, others are limited to fine-tuning a predetermined\ngene expression pattern. Here we explore the possibility that small RNAs\nparticipate in sharpening a gene expression profile that was crudely\nestablished by a morphogen. To this end we study a model where small RNAs\ninteract with a target gene and diffusively move from cell to cell.
