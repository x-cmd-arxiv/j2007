I show that, contrary to common wisdom, low-luminosity AGNs have\nsignificant nonstellar UV flux, and UV/X-ray luminosity ratios similar, on\naverage, to those of Seyfert 1 nuclei ~10^4 times more luminous. The alpha_ox\nindex that quantifies this ratio is in the range between -0.8 to -1.4, and is\nbelow the extrapolation to low luminosities of the relation between alpha_ ox\nand UV luminosity observed at higher luminosities. In terms of radio loudness,\nmost of the LINERs are indeed radio loud (or sometimes even ``super radio\nloud'') based on their radio/UV luminosity ratios, when compared to the most\nluminous quasars. However, the entire distribution of radio loudness has been\nshown to shift to higher radio/UV ratios at low AGN luminosities. In the\ncontext of this global shift, some LINERs (the majority) can be considered\nradio quiet, and some (from among those with black hole masses >~10^8.5 M_sun)\nare radio loud. The SEDs of low-luminosity (~10^40 erg/s) AGNs are thus quite\nsimilar to those of Seyferts up to luminosities of ~10^44erg/s, and there is no\nevidence for a sharp change in the SEDs at the lowest luminosities. Thin AGN\naccretion discs may therefore persist at low accretion rates, in analogy to\nsome recent findings for Galactic stellar-mass accreting black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 2007 13:25:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2007 21:00:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

In this\npaper, we use a ~ 160 ks XMM-Newton RGS spectrum to get the most accurate view\nyet of the ionised outflow (warm absorber) in NGC 7469 as seen in X-rays,\nfinding that there is a wide range of ionisation, with log xi in the range ~\n0.5-3.5 erg cm s^-1, and two main velocity regimes, at 580-720 and 2300 km\ns^-1, with the highest velocity gas being the least ionised.

Although commonly\ndealed with as elementary bosons, these composite bosons -- ``cobosons'' in\nshort -- differ from them due to their composite nature which makes the\nhandling of their many-body effects quite different from the existing\ntreatments valid for elementary bosons. Due to this composite nature, it is not\npossible to correctly describe the interaction between cobosons as a potential\n$V$. Consequently, the standard Fermi golden rule, written in terms of $V$,\ncannot be used to obtain the transition rates between exciton states. Through\nan unconventional expression for this Fermi golden rule, which is here given in\nterms of the Hamiltonian only, we here give a detailed calculation of the time\nevolution of two excitons. We compare the results of this exact approach with\nthe ones obtained by using an effective bosonic exciton Hamiltonian. We show\nthat the relation between the inverse lifetime and the sum of transition rates\nfor elementary bosons differs from the one of composite bosons by a factor of\n1/2, whatever the mapping from composite bosons to elementary bosons is. The\npresent paper thus constitutes a strong mathematical proof that, in spite of a\nwidely spread belief, we cannot forget the composite nature of these cobosons,\neven in the extremely low density limit of just two excitons. This paper also\nshows the (unexpected) cancellation, in the Born approximation, of the\ntwo-exciton transition rate for a finite value of the momentum transfer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 2007 15:01:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Although the\nproposed approach has more general scope, for the sake of clarity we focus on a\nspecific application example, namely, the transmission of digital images over\nnoisy binary-input output-symmetric channels. The basic building blocks of most\nstate-of the art source coders are: 1) a linear transformation; 2) scalar\nquantization of the transform coefficients; 3) probability modeling of the\nsequence of quantization indices; 4) an entropy coding stage. We identify the\nweakness of the conventional separated source-channel coding approach in the\ncatastrophic behavior of the entropy coding stage. Hence, we replace this stage\nwith linear coding, that maps directly the sequence of redundant quantizer\noutput symbols into a channel codeword. We show that this approach does not\nentail any loss of optimality in the asymptotic regime of large block length.\nHowever, in the practical regime of finite block length and low decoding\ncomplexity our approach yields very significant improvements. Furthermore, our\nscheme allows to retain the transform, quantization and probability modeling of\ncurrent state-of the art source coders, that are carefully matched to the\nfeatures of specific classes of sources. In our working example, we make use of\n``bit-planes'' and ``contexts'' model defined by the JPEG2000 standard and we\nre-interpret the underlying probability model as a sequence of conditionally\nMarkov sources.

It is applied to various quantum mechanical\nproblems in Atomic and Molecular physics with presence of regular or singular\npotentials. It has also been developed to handle single and multiple channel\nscattering problems where the phaseshift is required for the evaluation of the\nscattering cross-section. Its controllable accuracy makes it a valuable tool\nfor the evaluation of vibrational levels of cold molecules, a sensitive test of\nBohr correspondance principle and a powerful method to tackle local and\nnon-local spin dependent problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 2007 14:38:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
