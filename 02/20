Enhanced\ndissipation occurs over the entire frequency range rather than in a series of\nvery narrow resonant peaks, and is relatively insensitive to the effective\nviscosity. Hough waves are excited at the base of the convective zone and\npropagate into the radiative interior. We calculate the associated dissipation\nrate under the assumption that they do not reflect coherently from the center\nof the star. Tidal dissipation in a model based on the present Sun is\nsignificantly enhanced through the inclusion of the Coriolis force but may\nstill fall short of that required to explain the circularization of close\nbinary stars.

We find a\nsignificant trend of the GCLF dispersion with galaxy luminosity, in the sense\nthat smaller galaxies have narrower GCLFs. We show that this narrowing of the\nGCLF in a Gaussian description is driven by a steepening of the GC mass\nfunction above the turnover mass, as one moves to smaller host galaxies. We\nargue that this behavior at the high-mass end of the GC mass function is most\nlikely a consequence of systematic variations of the initial cluster mass\nfunction. The GCLF turnover mass M_TO is roughly constant, at ~ 2.2 x 10^5\nM_sun in bright galaxies, but it decreases slightly in dwarfs with M_B >~ -18.\nWe show that part of the variation could arise from the shorter dynamical\nfriction timescales in smaller galaxies.

The distribution function of the plasma and the\nenergy density of the magnetic field are prescribed as function of the distance\nfrom the pulsar by using the model by Kennel and Coroniti (1984) with $\\sigma =\n0.003$, where $\\sigma$ is the ratio of Poynting flux to the kinetic energy flux\nin the bulk motion just before the termination shock. Unlike previous models,\nwe introduce disordered magnetic field, which is parameterized by the\nfractional energy density of the disordered component. Flow dynamics is not\nsolved. The mean field is toroidal. Averaged polarization degree over the disc\nis obtained as a function of inclination angle and fractional energy density of\nthe disordered magnetic field. It is found for the Crab that the disordered\ncomponent has about 60 percent of the magnetic field energy. This value is also\nsupported by the facts that the disc appears not `lip-shape' but as `rings' in\nthe intensity map as was observed, and that the highest polarization degree of\n$\\sim 40$ percent is reproduced for rings, being consistent with the\nobservation. We suggest that because the disordered field contributes rather\npressure than tension, the pinch force may be over-estimated in previous\nrelativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Disruption of the toroidal\nmagnetic field with alternating direction, which is proposed by Lyubarski\n(2003), may actually takes place.

The rotation period\ndistributions were found to show a remarkable morphology as a function of mass,\nwith the fastest rotators bounded by P>0.25 days, and the slowest rotators for\nM<~0.5 M_solar bounded by a line of P \\propto M^3, with those for M>~0.5\nM_solar following a flatter relation closer to P ~ constant. Models of the\nrotational evolution were investigated, finding that the evolution of the\nfastest rotators was well-reproduced by a conventional solid body model with a\nmass-dependent saturation velocity, whereas core-envelope decoupling was needed\nto reproduce the evolution of the slowest rotators. None of our models were\nable to simultaneously reproduce the behaviour of both populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Feb 2007 09:39:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Thus the contracting universe goes through a\nnon-singular bounce and evolves smoothly into the expanding post big bang\nphase. The curvature perturbation acquires a scale-invariant spectrum well\nbefore the bounce in this scenario. It is sourced by the scale-invariant\nentropy perturbation engendered by two ekpyrotic scalar fields, a mechanism\nrecently proposed by Lehners et al.

Yet, subsequent studies\nhave shown that the model is based on incorrect assumptions. Specifically, the\nrepressor is a tetramerwith four (not two) inducer-binding sites, and the\noperon contains two auxiliary operators (in addition to the main operator).\nFurthermore, these structural features are crucial for the formation of DNA\nloops, the key determinants of lac repression and induction. Indeed, the\nrepression is determined almost entirely (>95%) by the looped complexes (Oehler\net al, EMBO J, 13, 3348, 1990), and the pronounced cooperativity of the\ninduction curve hinges upon the existence of the looped complexes (Oehler et\nal, Nucleic Acids Res, 34, 606, 2006). Here, we formulate a model of lac\ninduction taking due account of the tetrameric structure of the repressor and\nthe existence of looped complexes. We show that: (1) The kinetics are\nsignificantly more cooperative than those predicted by the Yagil & Yagil model.\n(2) The model provides good fits to the repression data for cells containing\ntetrameric (or mutant dimeric) repressor, as well as the induction curves for 6\ndifferent strains of E. coli. It also implies that the ratios of certain looped\nand non-looped complexes are independent of inducer and repressor levels, a\nconclusion that can be rigorously tested by gel electrophoresis. (3) Repressor\noverexpression dramatically increases the cooperativity of the induction curve.\nThis suggests that repressor overexpression can induce bistability in systems,\nsuch as growth of E. coli on lactose, that are otherwise monostable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Feb 2007 18:30:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Scattering from different atomic quantum states\ncreates different quantum states of the scattered light, which can be\ndistinguished by measurements of the spatial intensity distribution, quadrature\nvariances, photon statistics, or spectral measurements. In particular,\nangle-resolved intensity measurements reflect global statistics of atoms (total\nnumber of radiating atoms) as well as local statistical quantities (single-site\nstatistics even without an optical access to a single site) and pair\ncorrelations between different sites. As a striking example we consider\nscattering from transversally illuminated atoms into an optical cavity mode.\nFor the Mott insulator state, similar to classical diffraction, the number of\nphotons scattered into a cavity is zero due to destructive interference, while\nfor the superfluid state it is nonzero and proportional to the number of atoms.\nMoreover, we demonstrate that light scattering into a standing-wave cavity has\na nontrivial angle dependence, including the appearance of narrow features at\nangles, where classical diffraction predicts zero.
