We have studied (extended) racetrack models where\nsupersymmetry breaking and moduli stabilisation cannot be separated from each\nother. We show that even in such cases the realistic hierarchy can be achieved\non the expense of a single fine-tuning. The presence of two condensates changes\nthe role of the constant term in the superpotential, W_0, and solutions with\nsmall vacuum energy and large gravitino mass can be found even for very small\nvalues of W_0.

It turns out that the tuning with respect\nto the Planck scale required in the case of cancellable D-terms is much weaker\nthan in the case of non-cancellable ones.

A\nkeen eye notices that the after-slap rising tilt is not generally just\ndiametrically opposite the initial tilt but is veered to one side or the other.\nCushman and Duistermaat (2006) recently noticed such veering when a flat disk\nwith rolling boundary conditions is dropped nearly flat. Here, we generalize\nthese rolling disk results to arbitrary axi-symmetric bodies and to\nfrictionless sliding. More specifically, we study motions that almost but do\nnot quite involve a face-down collision of the round container's bottom with\nthe table-top. These motions involve a sudden rapid motion of the contact point\naround the circular base. Surprisingly, like for the rolling disk, the net\nangle of motion of this contact point is nearly independent of initial\nconditions. This angle of turn depends simply on the geometry and mass\ndistribution but not on the moment of inertia about the symmetry axis. We\nderive simple asymptotic formulas for this \"angle of turn\" of the contact point\nand check the result with numerics and with simple experiments. For tall\ncontainers (height much bigger than radius) the angle of turn is just over\n$\\pi$ and the sudden rolling motion superficially appears as a nearly symmetric\ncollision leading to leaning on an almost diametrically opposite point on the\nbottom rim.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Feb 2007 04:22:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 Dec 2008 05:29:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-30"}
