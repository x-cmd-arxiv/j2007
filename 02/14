Our approach involves the solution of a zero-energy\nscattering Schroedinger equation with an effective potential which includes a\nBose-like term from Jastrow-Feenberg correlations and a Fermi term from kinetic\nenergy and exchange, tailored to yield the Hartree-Fock limit at high carrier\ndensity. The theory is also shown to satisfy the plasmon sum rule and the\ncharge neutrality condition. We obtain good agreement with the available\nQuantum Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) data in symmetric bilayers over a wide\nrange of carrier density and layer spacing, and stress the role of three-body\ncorrelation terms in yielding fully quantitative agreement at strong coupling.\nSignals of impending transitions to density-modulated states at strong coupling\nand low layer spacing appear in the calculated pair correlations through\ninter-layer in-phase oscillations for electron-hole bilayers and out-of-phase\noscillations for electron-electron bilayers, in agreement with the DMC\nfindings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Feb 2007 10:51:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-09"}

For isotropic compactifications leading to of order\n$\\mathcal{O} (10^4)$ axions in the four dimensional spectrum we find that with\n$(M, g_{s})\\simeq(M_{GUT}, 0.5)$ the observed temperature fluctuations in the\nCMB are correctly reproduced. We assume an initially random distribution for\nthe vevs of the axions. The spectral index, $n_{s}$, is generically more red\nthan for $m^{2}\\phi^{2}$-inflation. The greater the vevs, the more red the\nspectral index becomes. Allowing for a wide range of vevs 55 $e$-foldings from\nthe end of inflation, we find $0.946\\lesssim n_{s} \\lesssim 0.962$. The\ntensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, is more sensitive to the vevs, but typically\nsmaller than in $m^{2}\\phi^{2}$-inflation. Furthermore, in the regime where the\nleading order theory is valid, $r$ is bounded by $r < 0.10$. The spectral index\nand the tensor-to-scalar ratio are correlated. For example, $n_{s}\\simeq 0.951$\ncorresponds to $r\\simeq 0.036$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Feb 2007 15:49:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Feb 2007 13:54:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2007 14:38:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-27"}

At strong driving, the\nscattered light separates into distinct spectral bands, such that each band can\nbe treated as independent, thus extending the set of observables. We focus on\nsecond-order intensity-intensity correlation functions in two- and multi-atom\nsystems. We demonstrate that for a single two-photon detector as, e.g., in\nlithography, increasing the driving field intensity leads to an increased\nspatial resolution of the second-order two-atom interference pattern. We show\nthat the cross-correlations between photons emitted in the spectral sidebands\nviolate Cauchy-Schwartz inequalities, and that their emission ordering cannot\nbe predicted. Finally, the results are generalized for multi-particle\nstructures, where we find results different from those in a Dicke-type sample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Feb 2007 09:47:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
