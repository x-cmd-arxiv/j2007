This is arguably the simplest time series model that one can write\ndown. The MA(1) with unit root ($\\theta_0=1$) arises naturally in a variety of\ntime series applications. For example, if an underlying time series consists of\na linear trend plus white noise errors, then the differenced series is an MA(1)\nwith unit root. In such cases, testing for a unit root of the differenced\nseries is equivalent to testing the adequacy of the trend plus noise model. The\nunit root problem also arises naturally in a signal plus noise model in which\nthe signal is modeled as a random walk. The differenced series follows a MA(1)\nmodel and has a unit root if and only if the random walk signal is in fact a\nconstant. The asymptotic theory of various estimators based on Gaussian\nlikelihood has been developed for the unit root case and nearly unit root case\n($\\theta=1+\\beta/n,\\beta\\le0$). Unlike standard $1/\\sqrt{n}$-asymptotics, these\nestimation procedures have $1/n$-asymptotics and a so-called pile-up effect, in\nwhich P$(\\hat{\\theta}=1)$ converges to a positive value. One explanation for\nthis pile-up phenomenon is the lack of identifiability of $\\theta$ in the\nGaussian case. That is, the Gaussian likelihood has the same value for the two\nsets of parameter values $(\\theta,\\sigma^2)$ and $(1/\\theta,\\theta^2\\sigma^2$).\nIt follows that $\\theta=1$ is always a critical point of the likelihood\nfunction. In contrast, for non-Gaussian noise, $\\theta$ is identifiable for all\nreal values. Hence it is no longer clear whether or not the same pile-up\nphenomenon will persist in the non-Gaussian case. In this paper, we focus on\nlimiting pile-up probabilities for estimates of $\\theta_0$ based on a Laplace\nlikelihood. In some cases, these estimates can be viewed as Least Absolute\nDeviation (LAD) estimates. Simulation results illustrate the limit theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Feb 2007 10:35:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-13"}

Not much are known on the\nforecasting theory for nonstationary process with estimated parameters. This\npaper investigates the recursive least square forecast for stationary and\nnonstationary processes with unit roots. We first prove that the accumulated\nforecast mean square error can be decomposed into two components, one of which\narises from estimation uncertainty and the other from the disturbance term. The\nformer, of the order of $\\log(T)$, is of second order importance to the latter\nterm, of the order T. However, since the latter is common for all predictors,\nit is the former that determines the property of each predictor. Our theorem\nimplies that the improvement of forecasting precision is of the order of\n$\\log(T)$ when existence of unit root is properly detected and taken into\naccount. Also, our theorem leads to a new proof of strong consistency of\npredictive least squares in model selection and a new test of unit root where\nno regression is needed. The simulation results confirm our theoretical\nfindings. In addition, we find that while mis-specification of AR order and\nunder-specification of the number of unit root have marginal impact on\nforecasting precision, over-specification of the number of unit root strongly\ndeteriorates the quality of long term forecast. As for the empirical study\nusing Taiwanese data, the results are mixed. Adaptive forecast and imposing\nunit root improve forecast precision for some cases but deteriorate forecasting\nprecision for other cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Feb 2007 12:54:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-13"}

Such sign representations are well-studied in computer\nscience and have applications to computational complexity and computational\nlearning theory. In this work, we present a systematic study of tradeoffs\nbetween degree and sparsity of sign representations through the lens of the\nparity function. We attempt to prove bounds that hold for any choice of set\n$A$. We show that sign representing parity over $\\{0,...,m-1\\}^n$ with the\ndegree in each variable at most $m-1$ requires sparsity at least $m^n$. We show\nthat a tradeoff exists between sparsity and degree, by exhibiting a sign\nrepresentation that has higher degree but lower sparsity. We show a lower bound\nof $n(m -2) + 1$ on the sparsity of polynomials of any degree representing\nparity over $\\{0,..., m-1\\}^n$. We prove exact bounds on the sparsity of such\npolynomials for any two element subset $A$. The main tool used is Descartes'\nRule of Signs, a classical result in algebra, relating the sparsity of a\npolynomial to its number of real roots. As an application, we use bounds on\nsparsity to derive circuit lower bounds for depth-two AND-OR-NOT circuits with\na Threshold Gate at the top. We use this to give a simple proof that such\ncircuits need size $1.5^n$ to compute parity, which improves the previous bound\nof ${4/3}^{n/2}$ due to Goldmann (1997).

Specifically, we show that small harmonic modulations of the\noptical lattice amplitude, with frequencies tuned to the eigenvalue spacings of\nthree \"unperturbed\" eigenstates, reveals a three-state STIRAP subsystem. We use\nthis model to realize an experimentally achievable method for transferring\ntrapped atoms from stationary to motional eigenstates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Feb 2007 08:01:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

To overcome this problem, we shall\npropose an alternative adiabatic procedure which (i) in the semiclassical limit\nreduces to the standard Fermi's golden rule, and (ii) describes a genuine\nLimblad evolution, thus providing a reliable/robust treatment of\nenergy-dissipation and dephasing processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Feb 2007 08:47:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This technique allows negative refraction in the optical\nregime at densities where the magnetic susceptibility is still small and with\nrefraction/absorption ratios that are orders of magnitude larger than those\nachievable previously.
