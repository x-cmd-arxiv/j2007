Since\nthe tracks published by different groups differ, it is often only possible to\ngive a rough estimate of the masses of young stars. It is thus crucial to test\nand calibrate the tracks. Up to now, only a few tests of the tracks could be\ncarried out. However, with the VLTI it is now possible to set constrains on the\ntracks by determining the masses of many young binary stars precisely. In order\nto use the VLTI efficiently, a first step is to find suitable targets, which is\nthe purpose of this work. Given the distance of nearby star-forming regions,\nsuitable VLTI targets are binaries with orbital periods between at least 50\ndays, and few years. Although a number of surveys for detecting spectroscopic\nbinaries have been carried out, most of the binaries found so far have periods\nwhich are too short. We thus surveyed the Chamaeleon, Corona Australis, Lupus,\nSco-Cen, rho Ophiuci star-forming regions in order to search for spectroscopic\nbinaries with periods longer than 50 days, which are suitable for the VLTI\nobservations. As a result of the 8 years campaign we discovered 8 binaries with\norbital periods longer than 50 days. Amongst the newly discovered long period\nbinaries is CS Cha, which is one of the few classical T Tauri stars with a\ncircumbinary disk. The survey is limited to objects with masses higher than 0.1\nto 0.2 Modot for periods between 1 and 8 years. We find that the frequency of\nbinaries with orbital periods < 3000 days is of 20+/-5 percent. The frequency\nof long and short period pre-main sequence spectroscopic binaries is about the\nsame as for stars in the solar neighbourhood. In total 14 young binaries are\nnow known which are suitable for mass determination with the VLTI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Feb 2007 18:30:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

However, this Meissner-like effect is seen in\nvacuum solutions of black hole electrodynamics whereas the Blandford-Znajek\nmechanism is concerned with plasma-filled magnetospheres.

After introducing compound quantum state and two\ntypes of informational divergences, namely, Araki-Umegaki (a-type) and of\nBelavkin-Staszewski (b-type) quantum relative entropic information, this paper\ntreats two types of quantum mutual information via entanglement and defines two\ntypes of corresponding quantum channel capacities as the supremum via the\ngeneralized encodings. It proves the additivity property of quantum channel\ncapacities via entanglement, which extends the earlier results of V.

A statistical\nexamination of these proposals suggests that whenever the Bayesian rule is\ntaken into account for two relevant events in two successive times, the\nprobabilistic description of them is unavoidably time-symmetric. Consequently,\nit seems that they cannot fulfill the implications of a so-called\ndelayed-choice experiment. As a possible alternative, however, we suggest a new\nexperimental arrangement in which one can change the whole state of a given\nsystem at a proper time (without measurement) to accomplish an actual\ndelayed-choice experiment with a time-asymmetric attribute. The peculiar\nfeatures of this experiment are then discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Feb 2007 11:39:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2007 12:11:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-08-20"}
