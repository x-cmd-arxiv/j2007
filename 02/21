Recent\nsimulations have shown that the magnetorotational turbulence thought to drive\naccretion in protoplanetary disks can affect migration by turning it into an\norbital random walk. However, these simulations neglected the disk's ionization\nstructure. Low ionization fraction near the midplane of the disk can decouple\nthe magnetic field from the gas, forming a dead zone with reduced or no\nturbulence. Here, to understand the effect of dead zones on protoplanetary\nmigration, we perform numerical simulations of a small region of a stratified\ndisk with magnetorotational turbulence confined to thin active layers above and\nbelow the midplane. Turbulence in the active layers exerts decreased, but still\nmeasurable, gravitational torques on a protoplanet located at the disk\nmidplane. We find a decrease of two orders of magnitude in the diffusion\ncoefficient for dead zones with dead-to-active surface density ratios\napproaching realistic values in protoplanetary disks. This torque arises\nprimarily from density fluctuations within a distance of one scale height of\nthe protoplanet.

This\nanti-correlation ($M_{\\rm BH}$ vs. $L_{\\rm IR}/L_{\\rm Edd}$) can be interpreted\nas the anti-correlation between the mass of a SMBH and the rate of mass\naccretion onto a SMBH normalized by the AGN Eddington rate, $\\dot{M}_{\\rm\nBH}/\\dot{M}_{\\rm Edd}$. In other words, the mass accretion rate $\\dot{M}_{\\rm\nBH}$ is not proportional to that of the central BH mass. Thus, this\nanti-correlation indicates that BH growth is determined by the external mass\nsupply process, and not the AGN Eddington-limited mechanism. Moreover, we found\nan interesting tendency for type I ULIRGs to favor a super-Eddington accretion\nflow, whereas QSOs tended to show a sub-Eddington flow.

The estimated\nunscreened EPI is so strong that it could easily transform doped holes into\nmobile lattice bipolarons in narrow-band Mott insulators such as cuprates.\nApplying a continuous-time quantum Monte-Carlo algorithm (CTQMC) we compute the\ntotal energy, effective mass, pair radius, number of phonons and isotope\nexponent of lattice bipolarons in the region of parameters where any\napproximation might fail taking into account the Coulomb repulsion and the\nfinite-range EPI.

We demonstrate that bipolarons can be\nsimultaneously small and light, provided suitable conditions on the\nelectron-phonon and electron-electron interaction are satisfied. Such light\nsmall bipolarons are a necessary precursor to high-temperature Bose-Einstein\ncondensation in solids. The light bipolaron mass is shown to be universal in\nsystems made of triangular plaquettes, due to a novel crab-like motion. Another\nsurprising result is that the triplet-singlet exchange energy is of the first\norder in the hopping integral and triplet bipolarons are heavier than singlets\nin certain lattice structures at variance with intuitive expectations. Finally,\nwe identify a range of lattices where superlight small bipolarons may be\nformed, and give estimates for their masses in the anti-adiabatic\napproximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Feb 2007 15:20:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-13"}

Often, for computational or other reasons, only a\nsmall subset of these features are selected for use in a model, based on some\nsimple measure such as correlation with the response variable. This procedure\nmay introduce an optimistic bias, however, in which the response variable\nappears to be more predictable than it actually is, because the high\ncorrelation of the selected features with the response may be partly or wholely\ndue to chance. We show how this bias can be avoided when using a Bayesian model\nfor the joint distribution of features and response. The crucial insight is\nthat even if we forget the exact values of the unselected features, we should\nretain, and condition on, the knowledge that their correlation with the\nresponse was too small for them to be selected. In this paper we describe how\nthis idea can be implemented for ``naive Bayes'' models of binary data.\nExperiments with simulated data confirm that this method avoids bias due to\nfeature selection. We also apply the naive Bayes model to subsets of data\nrelating gene expression to colon cancer, and find that correcting for bias\nfrom feature selection does improve predictive performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Feb 2007 20:02:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-13"}

We found that, for a GaAs spherical quantum\ndot in which the exciton interacts with bulk phonons, the maximal probability\nof the excited state can be increased up to 75 %. This probability can be\nconsidered as the efficiency for quantum information transfer from photon to\nexciton.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Feb 2007 05:42:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The amount of violation of these\ninequalities cannot exceed the bound set by the Grothendieck constants.\nHowever, if we go back to the original derivation by Bell, and use the perfect\nanti-correlation embodied in the singlet spin state, we can go beyond these\nbounds. In this paper we derive two-particle Bell inequalities for traceless\ntwo-outcome observables, whose violation in the singlet spin state go beyond\nthe Grothendieck constants both for the two and three dimensional cases.\nMoreover, creating a higher dimensional analog of perfect correlations, and\napplying a recent result of Alon and his associates (Invent. Math. 163 499\n(2006)) we prove that there are two-particle Bell inequalities for traceless\ntwo-outcome observables whose violation increases to infinity as the dimension\nand number of measurements grow. Technically these result are possible because\nperfect correlations (or anti-correlations) allow us to transport the indices\nof the inequality from the edges of a bipartite graph to those of the complete\ngraph. Finally, it is shown how to apply these results to mixed Werner states,\nprovided that the noise does not exceed 20%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Feb 2007 09:55:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2007 12:33:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2008 11:23:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
