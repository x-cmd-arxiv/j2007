To make the calculations tractable, we assume\nadiabatic, constant velocity winds. The neglect of radiative driving,\ngravitational deceleration, and cooling limit the application of our models to\nreal systems. However, these assumptions allow us to isolate the effect of the\nCoriolis force, and by simplifying the calculations, allow us to use a higher\nresolution (up to 640^3) and to conduct a larger survey of parameter space. We\nstudy the dynamics of collidng winds with equal mass loss rates and velocities\nemanating from equal mass stars on circular orbits, with a range of values for\nthe ratio of the wind to orbital velocity. We also study the dynamics of winds\nfrom stars on elliptical orbits and with unequal strength winds. Orbital motion\nof the stars sweeps the shocked wind gas into an Archimedean spiral, with\nasymmetric shock strengths and therefore unequal postshock temperatures and\ndensities in the leading and trailing edges of the spiral. We observe the\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability at the contact surface between the shocked winds\nin systems with orbital motion even when the winds are identical. The change in\nshock strengths caused by orbital motion increases the volume of X-ray emitting\npost-shock gas with T > 0.59 keV by 63% for a typical system as the ratio of\nwind velocity to orbital velocity decreases to V_w/V_o = 2.5. This causes\nincreased free-free emission from systems with shorter orbital periods and an\naltered time-dependence of the wind attenuation. We comment on the importance\nof the effects of orbital motion on the observable properties of colliding wind\nbinaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2007 19:26:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2007 21:18:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

In this paper, we suggest an alternative\nmechanism for the mass-loss of M-type AGB stars, involving the formation of\nboth carbon and silicate grains due to non-equilibrium effects, and we study\nthe viability of this scenario. We model the dynamical atmospheres and winds of\nAGB stars by solving the coupled system of frequency-dependent radiation\nhydrodynamics and time-dependent dust formation, using a parameterized\ndescription of non-equilibrium effects in the gas phase. This approach allows\nus to assess under which circumstances it is possible to drive winds with small\namounts of carbon dust and to get silicate grains forming in these outflows at\nthe same time. The properties of the resulting wind models, such as mass loss\nrates and outflow velocities, are well within the observed limits for M-type\nAGB stars. Furthermore, according to our results, it is quite unlikely that\nsignificant amounts of silicate grains will condense in a wind driven by a\nforce totally unrelated to dust formation, as the conditions in the upper\natmosphere and wind acceleration region put strong constraints on grain growth.\nThe proposed scenario provides a natural explanation for the observed\nsimilarities in wind properties of M-type and C-type AGB stars and implies a\nsmooth transition for stars with increasing carbon abundance, from\nsolar-composition to C-rich AGB stars, possibly solving the long-standing\nproblem of the driving mechanism for stars with C/O close to one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2007 18:51:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

In this paper, we\nreformulate the notions of this theory using the language of bialgebras (and\nHopf algebras) and introduce the class of involutive bialgebras and positive\n2-algebras.

A set of\nmatrices is said to have the finiteness property if the maximal rate of growth\nof long products of matrices taken from the set can be obtained by a periodic\nproduct. It was conjectured a decade ago that all finite sets of real matrices\nhave the finiteness property. This conjecture, known as the ``finiteness\nconjecture\", is now known to be false but no explicit counterexample to the\nconjecture is available and in particular it is unclear if a counterexample is\npossible whose matrices have rational or binary entries. In this paper, we\nprove that finite sets of nonnegative rational matrices have the finiteness\nproperty if and only if \\emph{pairs} of \\emph{binary} matrices do. We also show\nthat all {pairs} of $2 \\times 2$ binary matrices have the finiteness property.\nThese results have direct implications for the stability problem for sets of\nmatrices. Stability is algorithmically decidable for sets of matrices that have\nthe finiteness property and so it follows from our results that if all pairs of\nbinary matrices have the finiteness property then stability is decidable for\nsets of nonnegative rational matrices. This would be in sharp contrast with the\nfact that the related problem of boundedness is known to be undecidable for\nsets of nonnegative rational matrices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2007 16:26:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

An\neffective molecular Hamiltonian including Stark and Zeeman terms has been\nconstructed to describe single molecule dynamics inside the trap. Monte Carlo\nsimulation using this Hamiltonian accurately models the observed trap dynamics\nin various trap configurations. Confinement of cold polar molecules in a\nmagnetic trap, leaving large, adjustable electric fields for control, is an\nimportant step towards the study of low energy dipole-dipole collisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Feb 2007 03:10:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-16"}

With a set of randomly sampled nodes from the\nunderlying original networks, we rank individual nodes by three centrality\nmeasures: degree, betweenness, and closeness. The higher-ranking nodes from the\nsampled networks provide a relatively better characterisation of their ranks in\nthe original networks than the lower-ranking nodes. A closeness-based order\nrelationship is more reliable than any other quantity, due to the global nature\nof the closeness measure. In addition, we show that if access to hubs is\nlimited during the sampling process, an increase in the sampling fraction can\nin fact decrease the sampling accuracy.

How do we know? From theory or experiment? The\nhistory of this question is reviewed. Nonlinear generalizations of quantum\nmechanics have been proposed. They predict small but clear nonlinear effects,\nwhich very accurate experiments have not seen. Is there a reason in principle\nwhy nonlinearity is not found? Is it impossible? Does quantum dynamics have to\nbe linear? Attempts to prove this have not been decisive, because either their\nassumptions are not compelling or their arguments are not conclusive. The\nquestion has been left unsettled. There is a simple answer, based on a simple\nassumption. It was found in two steps separated by 44 years. They are steps\nback to simpler and more compelling assumptions. A proof of the assumptions of\nthe Wigner-Bargmann proof has been known since 1962. It assumes that the maps\nof density matrices in time are linear. For this step, it is also assumed that\ndensity matrices are mapped one-to-one onto density matrices. An alternative is\nto assume that pure states are mapped one-to-one onto pure states and that\nentropy does not decrease. In a step taken in 2006, it is proved that the maps\nof density matrices in time are linear. It is assumed, as in the earlier step,\nthat at each time the physical quantities and states are described by the usual\nlinear structures of quantum mechanics, so the question is only about how\nthings change in time. Beyond that, the proof assumes only that the dynamics\ndoes not depend on anything outside the system, but must allow the system to be\ndescribed as part of a larger system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2007 17:59:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-06"}

As it has been shown in\nthe literature, the bifurcation points, in autonomous dynamical systems, play a\ncrucial role for the onset of entanglement. Similarly, the existence of scars\namong the quantum states seems to be a factor in the dynamics of entanglement.\nHere we study these issues for a non-autonomous system, the Quantum Kicked Top,\nas a collective model of a multi-qubit system. Using the bifurcation diagram of\nthe corresponding classical limit (the Classical Kicked Top), we analyzed the\npair-wise and the bi-partite entanglement of the qubits and their relation to\nscars, as a function of the critical parameter of the system. We found that the\npair-wise entanglement and pair-wise negativity show a strong maximum precisely\nat the bifurcation points, while the bi-partite entanglement changes slope at\nthese points.
