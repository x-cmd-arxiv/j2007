Three of the nine detected\nsubmillimeter maser spots are associated with the centimeter masers spatially\nas well as kinematically, while there are 36 22 GHz maser spots without\ncorresponding submillimeter masers. In the HW2 source, both the 321 GHz and 22\nGHz masers occur within the region of ~1'' which includes the disk-jet system,\nbut the position angles of the roughly linear structures traced by the masers\nindicate that the 321 GHz masers are along the jet while the 22 GHz masers are\nperpendicular to it.

Here we argue that there exists a fundamental\nrelation between the spin period of a pulsar and its companion mass, and that\nthis determines many of the observable properties of a binary pulsar. No\nrecycled pulsars exist in which the minimum companion mass exceeds (P/10 ms)\nSolar Masses. Furthermore, the three fastest disk millisecond pulsars are\neither single, or possess extremely low-mass companions Mc~0.02 Mo, consistent\nwith this relation. Finally, the four relativistic binaries for which we have\nactual measurements of neutron star masses, suggest that not only are their\nspin periods related to the companion neutron star mass, but that the kick\nimparted to the system depends upon it too, leading to a correlation between\norbital eccentricity and spin period. The isolation of the relativistic binary\npulsars in the magnetic field-period diagram is used to argue that this must be\nbecause the kicks imparted to proto-relativistic systems are usually small,\nleading to very few if any isolated runaway mildly-recycled pulsars. This calls\ninto question the magnitude of supernova kicks in close binaries, which have\nbeen usually assumed to be similar to those imparted to the bulk of the pulsar\npopulation.

The aim of the present follow-up study is to investigate the effects\nof variable molecular opacities on the evolutionary properties of luminous AGB\nstars with massive envelopes, i.e. with initial masses from ~3.5 Msun up to 5-8\nMsun, which are predicted to experience both the third dredge-up and hot-bottom\nburning.

The Fe-rich gas ejected by ellipticals accounts for the\nX_Fe,ICM values observed at z > 0.5, whereas the gas stripped from the\nprogenitors of the S0 galaxies accounts for the increase of X_Fe,ICM observed\nat z<0.5. We tested two different scenarios for Type Ia supernova (SN)\nprogenitors and we model the Type Ia SN rate observed in clusters, finding a\ngood agreement between our predictions and the available observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Feb 2007 13:59:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Based on their location in the luminosity-size diagram we estimated\nprobabilities of them being typical globular clusters as those found in the\nGalaxy. A total of about 570 cluster candidates were found down to V=26.5. We\nmeasured sizes for approximately 200 of them. The observed colour distribution\nhas three apparent peaks. Likewise for the size distribution. We identified the\nsmaller population as being mainly typical globular clusters, while the more\nextended objects have small probabilities of being such objects.

This mechanism is then used as the basis of two\nscalable architectures for flux qubits taking into account crosstalk and\nfault-tolerant considerations such as permitting a universal set of logical\ngates, parallelism, measurement and initialization, and data mobility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Feb 2007 21:49:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Apr 2007 00:07:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-12-19"}

Application of the pebble game\napproach to general 3D networks has been hindered by the fact that the\nunderlying mathematical theory is, strictly speaking, invalid in this case. We\nconstruct an approximate pebble game algorithm for general 3D networks, as well\nas a slower but exact algorithm, the relaxation algorithm, that we use for\ntesting the new pebble game.

While a first\norder rigidity transition has been observed for Bethe lattices and networks\nwith ``chemical order'', this is the first time it has been seen for a regular\nrandomly diluted network. In the case of site dilution, the transition is also\nfirst order for BCC, but results for FCC suggest a second order transition.\nEven in bond-diluted lattices, while the transition appears massively first\norder in the order parameter (the percolating cluster size), it is continuous\nin the elastic moduli.

We investigate the mesh network\nwhen there is one source, one destination, and multiple relays, which we call\nthe single source multiple relay single destination (SSMRSD) mesh network. We\nderive the asymptotic capacity of the SSMRSD mesh network when the relay powers\ngrow to infinity. Our approach is as follows. We first look at an upper bound\non the information theoretic capacity of these networks in a Gaussian setting.\nWe then show that this bound is achievable asymptotically using the\ncompress-and-forward strategy for the multiple relay channel. We also perform\nnumerical computations for the case when the relays have finite powers. We\nobserve that even when the relay power is only a few times larger than the\nsource power, the compress-and-forward rate gets close to the capacity. The\nresults indicate the value of cooperation in wireless mesh networks.

The proof is general and\ndoes not rely on the details of the geometry of the compact Calabi-Yau internal\nspace. We finally analyze the consequences of these constraints on the\nstatistics of meta-stable de Sitter vacua and address some other related\nissues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Feb 2007 19:10:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2007 23:53:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-17"}

Although\nQCD is not conformally invariant, one can nevertheless use the mathematical\nrepresentation of the conformal group in five-dimensional anti-de Sitter space\nto construct a first approximation to the theory. The AdS/CFT correspondence\nalso provides insights into the inherently non-perturbative aspects of QCD,\nsuch as the orbital and radial spectra of hadrons and the form of hadronic\nwavefunctions. In particular, we show that there is an exact correspondence\nbetween the fifth-dimensional coordinate of AdS space z and a specific impact\nvariable zeta which measures the separation of the quark and gluonic\nconstituents within the hadron in ordinary space-time. This connection allows\none to compute the analytic form of the frame-independent light-front\nwavefunctions, the fundamental entities which encode hadron properties and\nallow the computation of decay constants, form factors, and other exclusive\nscattering amplitudes. New relativistic light-front equations in ordinary\nspace-time are found which reproduce the results obtained using the\n5-dimensional theory. The effective light-front equations possess remarkable\nalgebraic structures and integrability properties. Since they are complete and\northonormal, the AdS/CFT model wavefunctions can also be used as a basis for\nthe diagonalization of the full light-front QCD Hamiltonian, thus\nsystematically improving the AdS/CFT approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Feb 2007 00:10:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

Inspired by Bohr and Heisenberg about the\napplication of interdependent uncertainty in the interaction between action and\nobservation, making organizations bistable, we have begun to construct a theory\nof organizations based on the uncertainty of energy level (resources) and\nbelief/action consensus, leading to preliminary metrics of organizational\nperformance that we have discovered in field studies. Our goal in this project\nis to address the problem posed by organizations with: the development of new\ntheory; field tests of new metrics for organizations; and the development of\nquantum ABMs set within a social circuit as a building block for an\norganization. Should we be successful, our research would represent a\nfundamental departure from traditional observational methods of social science\nby forming the basis of a predictive science of organizations. We expect that\nreplacing the traditional method of observation with a predictive science must\naccount for when cognitive observations work and when they do not (illusions).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Feb 2007 23:05:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It is known that such witnesses are related\nto k-positive maps. In this article we propose a new proof for the\ncorrespondence between vectors having Schmidt number k and k-positive maps\nusing Jamiolkowski's criterion for positivity of linear maps; to this aim, we\nalso investigate the precise notion of the term \"Jamiolkowski isomorphism\". As\nconsequences of our proof we get the Jamiolkowski criterion for complete\npositivity, and we find a special case of a result by Choi, namely that\nk-positivity implies complete positivity, if k is the dimension of the smaller\none of the Hilbert spaces on which the operators act.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Feb 2007 14:01:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-12-17"}
