Our motivation is a recent suggestion of Werner & Herwig (2006) that\nprevious evolution should be important in shaping the final post--AGB track and\nthe persisting discrepancy between asteroseismological and spectroscopical mass\ndeterminations. This work is thus complementary to our previous work (Miller\nBertolami & Althaus 2006) and intends to shed some light on the uncertainty\nbehind the evolutionary tracks presented there. We compute full evolutionary\nmodels for PG1159 stars taking into account different extramixing\n(overshooting) efficiencies and lifetimes on the TP-AGB during the progenitor\nevolution. We also assess the effect of possible differences in the opacities\nand equation of state by artificially changing them before the PG1159 stage.\nAlso comparisons are made with the few H-deficient post--AGB tracks available\nin the literature. Contrary to our expectations, we found that previous\nevolution is not a main factor in shaping H--deficient post--AGB tracks.\nInterestingly enough, we find that only an increase of $\\sim50%$ in the\nintershell opacities at high effective temperatures may affect the tracks as to\nreconcile spectroscopic and asteroseismologic mass determinations. This forces\nus to conclude that our previous tracks (Miller Bertolami & Althaus 2006) are\nrobust enough as to be used for spectroscopic mass determinations, unless\nopacities in the intershell region are substantially different. Our results,\nthen, call for an analysis of possible systematics in the usually adopted\nasteroseismological mass determination methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2007 18:12:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

Below some frequency w_c << w_0 (where w_0 is of the order of\nDebye frequency) the instability, controlled by the anharmonicity, creates a\nnew stable universal spectrum of harmonic vibrations with a Boson peak feature\nas well as double-well potentials with a wide distribution of barrier heights.\nBoth are determined by the strength of the interaction I ~ w_c between the\noscillators.

In star-forming environments,\nenhanced cooling can potentially lead to fragmentation and the formation of\nlow-mass stars, where metal-free gas-clouds have been shown not to fragment.\nAdding metal cooling to numerical simulations has traditionally required a\nchoice between speed and accuracy. We introduce a method that uses the\nsophisticated chemical network of the photoionization software, Cloudy, to\ninclude radiative cooling from a complete set of metals up to atomic number 30\n(Zn) that can be used with large-scale three-dimensional hydrodynamic\nsimulations. Our method is valid over an extremely large temperature range (10\nK < T < 10^8 K), up to hydrogen number densities of 10^12 cm^-3. At this\ndensity, a sphere of 1 Msun has a radius of roughly 40 AU. We implement our\nmethod in the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) hydrodynamic/N-body code, Enzo.\nUsing cooling rates generated with this method, we study the physical\nconditions that led to the transition from Population III to Population II star\nformation. While C, O, Fe, and Si have been previously shown to make the\nstrongest contribution to the cooling in low-metallicity gas, we find that up\nto 40% of the metal cooling comes from fine-structure emission by S, when solar\nabundance patterns are present. At metallicities, Z > 10^-4 Zsun, regions of\ndensity and temperature exist where gas is both thermally unstable and has a\ncooling time less than its dynamical time. We identify these doubly unstable\nregions as the most inducive to fragmentation. At high redshifts, the CMB\ninhibits efficient cooling at low temperatures and, thus, reduces the size of\nthe doubly unstable regions, making fragmentation more difficult.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2007 02:09:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2008 07:14:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We divide the LBG sample into two sub-classes: red LBGs\n(RLBGs) detected at 24 micron which are mainly Luminous IR Galaxies (LIRGs) and\nblue LBGs (BLBGs) undetected at 24 microns down to 83 microJy.

The median SED of the BLBGs is consistent with their containing the\nsame stellar population as the RLBGs but with a lower dust content. The\nluminosity function of our LBG sample at z~1 is similar to the luminosity\nfunction of NUV-selected galaxies at the same redshift.

Summing up the detected UV (1150A rest-frame) and IR-based star\nformation rates of the detected objects, we find that only one third of the\ntotal (i.e. UV + dust) LBG SFR resides in BLBGs and two thirds in RLBGs, even\nthough most LBGs at z~1 are BLBGs. On the other hand, the total SFR of LBGs\naccounts for only 11% of the total SFR at z~1.

For this reason it is necessary to\ninvestigate in detail the characteristics of the polarization signals produced\nby their highly ionized intra-cluster medium (ICM). This work is focussed on\nthe polarization effect induced by the ICM bulk motions, the so-called kpSZ\nsignal, which has an amplitude proportional to the optical depth and to the\nsquare of the tangential velocity. In particular we study how this polarization\nsignal is affected by the internal dynamics of galaxy clusters and what is its\ndependence on the physical modelling adopted to describe the baryonic\ncomponent. This is done by producing realistic kpSZ maps starting from the\noutputs of two different sets of high-resolution hydrodynamical N-body\nsimulations. The first set (17 objects) follows only non-radiative\nhydrodynamics, while for each of 9 objects of the second set we implement four\ndifferent kinds of physical processes. Our results shows that the kpSZ signal\nturns out to be a very sensitive probe of the dynamical status of galaxy\nclusters. We find that major merger events can amplify the signal up to one\norder of magnitude with respect to relaxed clusters, reaching amplitude up to\nabout 100 nuK. This result implies that the internal ICM dynamics must be taken\ninto account when evaluating this signal because simplicistic models, based on\nspherical rigid bodies, may provide wrong estimates.

These huge differences between the\nmagnetic field values and the ages can be explained based on a B-decay model.\nIf the decay is assumed to be exponential, the characteristic decay time turns\nout to be several thousand years which is three orders of magnitude smaller\nthan the characteristic decay time of radio pulsars represented in an earlier\nwork. The lack of detection of radio emission from DRQNSs and the lack of point\nsources and pulsar wind nebulae in most of the observed SNRs can also be partly\nexplained by such a very rapid exponential decay. The large difference between\nthe characteristic decay times of DRQNSs and radio pulsars must be related to\nthe differences in the magnetic fields, equation of states and masses of these\nisolated neutron stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2007 14:13:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

The B-DMFT is applicable for\narbitrary values of the coupling parameters and temperature and becomes exact\nin the limit of high spatial dimensions d or coordination number Z of the\nlattice. In contrast to its fermionic counterpart the construction of the\nB-DMFT requires different scalings of the hopping amplitudes with Z depending\non whether the bosons are in their normal state or in the Bose-Einstein\ncondensate. A detailed discussion of how this conceptual problem can be\novercome by performing the scaling in the action rather than in the Hamiltonian\nitself is presented. The B-DMFT treats normal and condensed bosons on equal\nfooting and thus includes the effects caused by their dynamic coupling. It\nreproduces all previously investigated limits in parameter space such as the\nBeliaev-Popov and Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximations and generalizes the\nexisting mean-field theories of interacting bosons. The self-consistency\nequations of the B-DMFT are those of a bosonic single-impurity coupled to two\nreservoirs corresponding to bosons in the condensate and in the normal state,\nrespectively. We employ the B-DMFT to solve a model of itinerant and localized,\ninteracting bosons analytically.
