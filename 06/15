Its forces may be suppressed\njust below the current bounds by the chameleon-like mimicry, whereby only outer\nlayers of mass distributions, of thickness $1/m_\\phi$, give off appreciable\nlong range forces. After inflation and reheating, the field is relativistic,\nand attains a Planckian expectation value before Hubble friction freezes it.\nThis can make gravity in space slightly stronger than on Earth. During the\nmatter era, interactions with nonrelativistic matter dig a minimum close to the\nPlanck scale. However, due to its sub-gravitational matter couplings the field\nwill linger away from this minimum until the matter energy density dips below\n$\\sim 10^{-12} {\\rm eV}^4$. Then it starts to roll to the minimum, driving a\nperiod of cosmic acceleration. Among the signatures of this scenario may be\ndark energy equation of state $w \\ne -1$, stronger gravity in dilute mediums,\nthat may influence BBN and appear as an excess of dark matter, and\nsub-millimeter corrections to Newton's law, close to the present laboratory\nlimits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2007 19:59:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2007 23:11:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

We use Monte\nCarlo simulations up to a length of 256 to map out the phase diagram in the\nplane of parameters and determine the order of the associated phase\ntransitions. We discuss the connections to semi-flexible polymers and other\npolymer models. Importantly, we demonstrate that for a range of energy\nparameters two phase transitions occur on lowering the temperature, the second\nbeing a transition from the globule state to the crystal state. We argue from\nour data that this globule-to-crystal transition is continuous in two\ndimensions in accord with field-theory arguments concerning Hamiltonian walks,\nbut is first order in three dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2007 17:08:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Many efforts are being made to characterize extrasolar planetary\nsystems and unveil the fundamental mechanisms of planet formation. An important\naspect of the problem, which remains largely unknown, is to understand how the\nplanet formation process depends on the mass of the parent star. In particular,\nas most planets discovered to date orbit a solar-mass primary, little is known\nabout planet formation around more massive stars. Aims. To investigate this\npoint, we present first results from a radial velocity planet search around red\ngiants in the clump of intermediate-age open clusters. We choose clusters\nharbouring red giants with masses between 1.5 and 4 M_sun, using the well-known\ncluster parameters to accurately determine the stellar masses. We are therefore\nexploring a poorly-known domain of primary masses, which will bring new\ninsights into the properties of extrasolar planetary systems. Methods. We are\nfollowing a sample of about 115 red giants with the Coralie and HARPS\nspectrographs to obtain high-precision radial velocity (RV) measurements and\ndetect giant planets around these stars. We use bisector and activity index\ndiagnostics to distinguish between planetary-induced RV variations and stellar\nphotospheric jitter. Results.

Here we report thermopower measurements, S(T), on\nMgCNi3, MgCNi3-xFex and MgCNi3-xRux. For MgCNi3, the thermopower is negative, -\n12.5 mikroV/K, at 300 K. The absolute value of S decreases as x increases in\nMgCNi3-xFex and MgCNi3-xRux. The sign of S changes from negative to positive at\nlow temperatures for values of x > 0.01. These data show that the carriers in\nMgCNi3 are electrons, and by increasing x and decreasing temperature, the\nparticipation of hole carriers clearly increases. The influence of the magnetic\nmoments of the Fe atoms on the thermopower is not visible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2007 19:35:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

First, when the defect is localized and weak,\neigenvalues of defect modes bifurcated from edges of Bloch bands are derived\nanalytically. It is shown that in an attractive (repulsive) defect, defect\nmodes bifurcate out from Bloch-band edges with normal (anomalous) diffraction\ncoefficients. Furthermore, distances between defect-mode eigenvalues and\nBloch-band edges are exponentially small functions of the defect strength,\nwhich is very different from the one-dimensional case where such distances are\nquadratically small with the defect strength. It is also found that some\ndefect-mode branches bifurcate not from Bloch-band edges, but from quasi-edge\npoints within Bloch bands, which is very unusual. Second, when the defect is\nlocalized but strong, defect modes are determined numerically. It is shown that\nboth the repulsive and attractive defects can support various types of defect\nmodes such as fundamental, dipole, quadrupole, and vortex modes. These modes\nreside in various bandgaps of the photonic lattice. As the defect strength\nincreases, defect modes move from lower bandgaps to higher ones when the defect\nis repulsive, but remain within each bandgap when the defect is attractive,\nsimilar to the one-dimensional case. The same phenomena are observed when the\ndefect is held fixed while the applied dc field (which controls the lattice\npotential) increases. Lastly, if the defect is non-localized (i.e. it persists\nat large distances in the lattice), it is shown that defect modes can be\nembedded inside the continuous spectrum, and they can bifurcate out from edges\nof the continuous spectrum algebraically rather than exponentially.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jun 2007 07:46:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The data show that faceting proceeds in two stages.\nThe first stage is short and leads to the appearance of a step density wave,\nwith a wavelength roughly independent of the surface orientation. The second\nstage is much slower, and leads to the formation of a hill-and-valley\nstructure, the period of which depends on the initial surface orientation. A\nsimple continuum model enables us to point out why the wavelength of the step\ndensity wave does not depend on the microscale details of the surface. The\nfinal wavelength is controlled by the competition between elastic step-step\ninteraction and facet edge energy cost.

The stability of\nbifurcated solutions of this system is analyzed, and the long-time asymptotic\nbehavior of the bifurcated solutions is established rigorously.
