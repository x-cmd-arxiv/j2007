Using a stochastic\nmodel, we found that the large behavioral variability experimentally observed\nin non-stimulated cells is a direct consequence of the architecture of this\nadaptive system. Reversible covalent modification cycles, in which methylation\nand demethylation reactions antagonistically regulate the activity of\nreceptor-kinase complexes, operate outside the region of first-order kinetics.\nAs a result, the receptor-kinase that governs cellular behavior exhibits a\nsigmoidal activation curve. This curve simultaneously amplifies the inherent\nstochastic fluctuations in the system and lengthens the relaxation time in\nresponse to stimulus. Because stochastic fluctuations cause large behavioral\nvariability and the relaxation time governs the average duration of runs in\nresponse to small stimuli, cells with the greatest fluctuating behavior also\ndisplay the largest chemotactic response.

In this paper we address the elementary question of\nthe effect of vacancies on the orientation of the surrounding magnetic moments\nin an antiferromagnet. In the presence of a magnetic field, alternating\nmagnetic moments are induced, which can be described by a universal expression\nthat is valid in any ordered antiferromagnet and turns out to be independent of\ntemperature over a large range.

To investigate the possible cause of the dearth of SF in these\nsystems, we study the gravitational stability of CN gas disks embedded within\nthe potentials of both the stellar bulge and the central massive black hole\n(BH) in ellipticals. We find that CN disks in higher mass galaxies are\ngenerally more stable than those in lower mass galaxies, because higher mass\ngalaxies tend to have more massive BHs and more centrally concentrated stellar\ndensity profiles. We also consider the case in which the central stellar\ndensity profile has a core, which is often observed for ellipticals whose total\nstellar mass is higher than about 10^11 Msun. Such a cored stellar density\nprofile leads to more unstable CN disks than the power-law density profile\ncharacteristic of less massive galaxies. However, the more massive BHs in\nhigh-mass galaxies act to stabilize the CN disk. Our results demonstrate that\nthe gravitational potentials of both the central BH and the stellar component\nshould be taken into account when studying the properties of CN disks, as their\nstability is sensitive to both the BH mass and the stellar density profile.

Halos evolve through a series of quiescent\nphases of a slow accretion intermitted by violent events of major mergers. In\nthe quiescent phases the density of the halo closely follows the NFW profile\nand the phase-space density profile, Q(r), is given by the Taylor & Navarro\npower law, r^{-beta}, where beta ~ 1.9 and stays remarkably stable over the\nHubble time. Expressing the phase-space density by the NFW parameters, Q(r)=Qs\n(r/Rs)^{-beta}, the evolution of Q is determined by Qs. We have found that the\neffective mass surface density within Rs, Sigma_s = rhos Rs, remains constant\nthroughout the evolution of a given DM halo along the main branch of its\nmerging tree. This invariance entails that Qs ~ Rs^{-5/2} and Q(r) ~\nSigma_s^{-1/2} Rs^{-5/2} (r/ Rs)^{-beta}. It follows that the phase-space\ndensity remains constant, in the sense of Qs=const., in the quiescent phases\nand it decreases as Rs^{-5/2} in the violent ones. The physical origin of the\nNFW density profile and the phase-space density power law is still unknown.\nYet, the numerical experiments show that halos recover these relations after\nthe violent phases. The major mergers drive Rs to increase and Qs to decrease\ndiscontinuously while keeping Qs Rs^{5/2} = const.

What fraction of the known dwarf galaxies in the Local\nUniverse can have this origin is still a matter of debate.

Methods: We make use of 2-D\nchemodynamical calculations in order to study the early evolution of isolated,\ndark matter-free dwarf galaxies. We present models in which feedback parameters\nare varied. We also compare the results with dark matter-dominated dwarf galaxy\nmodels. Results: All the considered models show that the star formation\nproceeds for more than 300 Myr, therefore dwarf galaxies without large dark\nmatter halos are not necessarily quickly destroyed. The chemical evolution of\nthese objects is consistent with the main chemical properties of the dSphs of\nthe Local Group.

The targets are members of the Tucana and Beta\nPictoris moving groups apart from the somewhat older star HIP 71395 that has a\nradial velocity trend suggesting a massive planet in large orbit. The survey\nwas carried out in the L-band using adaptive optics assisted imaging with\nNAOS-CONICA (NACO) at the VLT. The chosen observation wavelength is well suited\nto search for close companions around young stars and delivers unprecedented\ndetection limits. The presented technique reaches some of the best\nsensitivities as of today and is currently the most sensitive method for the\ncontrast limited detection of substellar companions that are cooler than about\n1000K.

The Zeeman interaction is extended along the wire and produces\ngaps in the energy spectrum which allow electron propagation only for spinors\nlying along a certain direction. For spins in the opposite direction the waves\nare evanescent far away from the Rashba region, which plays the role of the\nscattering center. The most interesting case occurs when the magnetic field is\nperpendicular to the Rashba field. Then, the spins of the asymptotic\nwavefunctions are not eigenfunctions of the Rashba Hamiltonian and the\nresulting coupling between spins in the Rashba region gives rise to sudden\nchanges of the transmission probability when the Fermi energy is swept along\nthe gap. After briefly examining the energy spectrum and eigenfunctions of a\nwire with extended Rashba coupling, we analyze the transmission through a\nregion of localized Rashba interaction, in which a double interface separates a\nregion of constant Rashba interaction from wire leads free from spin-orbit\ncoupling. For energies slightly above the propagation threshold, we find the\nubiquitous occurrence of transmission zeros (antiresonances) which are analyzed\nby matching methods in the one-dimensional limit. We find that a a minimal\ntight-binding model yields analytical transmission lineshapes of Fano\nantiresonance type. More general angular dependences of the external magnetic\nfield is treated within projected Schroedinger equations with Hamiltonian\nmatrix elements mixing wavefunction components. Finally, we consider a\nrealistic quantum wire where the energy subbands are coupled via the Rashba\nintersubband coupling term and discuss its effect on the transmission zeros.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2007 09:21:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In this work we\npresent a new family of templates for the detection of gravitational waves from\nthe inspiral of two comparable-mass black hole binaries. These new adiabatic\ntemplates are based on re-expressing the derivative of the binding energy and\nthe gravitational wave flux functions in terms of shifted Chebyshev\npolynomials. The Chebyshev polynomials are a useful tool in numerical methods\nas they display the fastest convergence of any of the orthogonal polynomials.\nIn this case they are also particularly useful as they eliminate one of the\nfeatures that plagues the post-Newtonian expansion. The Chebyshev binding\nenergy now has information at all post-Newtonian orders, compared to the\npost-Newtonian templates which only have information at full integer orders. In\nthis work, we compare both the post-Newtonian and Chebyshev templates against a\nfiducially exact waveform.

Our\nresults show that the Chebyshev templates achieve extremely high fitting\nfactors at all PN orders and provide excellent parameter extraction.
