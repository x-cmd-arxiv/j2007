We examine in more detail a previously studied\nquantum state of the massless minimally coupled scalar field, which we call a\n``Helfer state''. This is a state in which the energy density can be made\narbitrarily negative over an arbitrarily large region of space, but only at one\ninstant in time. In the Helfer state, the negative energy density is\naccompanied by rapidly time-varying energy fluxes. It is the latter feature\nwhich allows the quantum inequalities, bounds which restrict the magnitude and\nduration of negative energy, to hold for this class of states. An observer who\ninitially passes through the negative energy region will quickly encounter\nfluxes of positive energy which subsequently enter the region. We examine in\ndetail the correlation between the energy density and flux in the Helfer state\nin terms of their expectation values. We then study the correlation function\nbetween energy density and flux in the Minkowski vacuum state, for a massless\nminimally coupled scalar field in both two and four dimensions. In this latter\nanalysis we examine correlation functions rather than expectation values.\nRemarkably, we see qualitatively similar behavior to that in the Helfer state.\nMore specifically, an initial negative energy vacuum fluctuation in some region\nof space is correlated with a subsequent flux fluctuation of positive energy\ninto the region. We speculate that the mechanism which ensures that the quantum\ninequalities hold in the Helfer state, as well as in other quantum states\nassociated with negative energy, is, at least in some sense, already\n``encoded'' in the fluctuations of the vacuum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2007 18:56:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Oct 2007 01:01:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Proper motion errors are typically\n1 mas/yr and field dependent systematics are below 0.2 mas/yr.\nCross-referencing with the 2MASS catalog yielded a sample of ~8,700 stars, from\nwhich predominantly disk and bulge subsamples were selected photometrically\nfrom the JH color-magnitude diagram. The two samples exhibited different\nproper-motion distributions, with the disk displaying the expected reflex solar\nmotion as a function of magnitude. Galactic rotation was also detected for\nstars between ~2 and ~3 kpc from us. The bulge sample, represented by red\ngiants, has an intrinsic proper motion dispersion of (sigma_l,sigma_b)=(3.39,\n2.91)+/-(0.11,0.09) mas/yr, which is in good agreement with previous results,\nand indicates a velocity anisotropy consistent with either rotational\nbroadening or tri-axiality. A mean distance of 6.37^{+0.87}_{-0.77} kpc has\nbeen estimated for the bulge sample, based on the observed K magnitude of the\nhorizontal branch red clump. The metallicity [M/H] distribution was also\nobtained for a subsample of 60 bulge giants stars, based on calibrated\nphotometric indices. The observed [M/H] shows a peak value at [M/H]~-0.1 with\nan extended metal poor tail and around 30% of the stars with supersolar\nmetallicity. No change in proper motion dispersion was observed as a function\nof [M/H]. We are currently in the process of obtaining CCD UBVRI photometry for\nthe entire proper-motion sample of ~21,000 stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2007 20:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

This allows us to handle inflation models that yield spectra that\nare not well described by the standard spectral parameterization.

In this paper, we specify a general\nstochastic SIR epidemic model and prove that the mean generation interval\ndecreases when susceptible persons are at risk of infectious contact from\nmultiple sources. The intuition behind this is that when a susceptible person\nhas multiple potential infectors, there is a ``race'' to infect him or her in\nwhich only the first infectious contact leads to infection. In an epidemic, the\nmean generation interval contracts as the prevalence of infection increases. We\ncall this global competition among potential infectors. When there is rapid\ntransmission within clusters of contacts, generation interval contraction can\nbe caused by a high local prevalence of infection even when the global\nprevalence is low. We call this local competition among potential infectors.\nUsing simulations, we illustrate both types of competition.\n  Finally, we show that hazards of infectious contact can be used instead of\ngeneration intervals to estimate the time course of the effective reproductive\nnumber in an epidemic.

Using traditional approaches such as gateways or\nfirewalls for deterring worm propagation in encounter-based networks is\ninappropriate. Because this type of network is highly dynamic and has no\nspecific boundary, a distributed counter-worm mechanism is needed. We propose\nmodels for the worm interaction approach that relies upon automated beneficial\nworm generation to alleviate problems of worm propagation in such networks. We\nstudy and analyze the impact of key mobile node characteristics including node\ncooperation, immunization, on-off behavior on the worm propagations and\ninteractions.

Furthermore, on-off behavior linearly impacts only timing\naspect but not the overall infection. Using realistic mobile network\nmeasurements, we find that encounters are non-uniform, the trends are\nconsistent with the model but the magnitudes are drastically different.\nImmunization seems to be the most effective in such scenarios.

These spaces appear to indicate that we can dispense\nwith gravitational singularities. The key mathematical ideas in the present\napproach are to include a complex phase factor, such as, e^{i\\phi} in the\nLorentz transformation and to use both the proper time and the proper mass as\nparameters. To develop the most general case, a complex parameter \\sigma=s+im,\nis introduced, where s is the proper time, and m is the proper mass, and \\sigma\nand {\\sigma}/{|\\sigma|} are used to parameterize the position of a particle (or\nreference frame) in space-time-matter phase space. A new reference variable,\nu={m}/{r}, is needed (in addition to velocity), and assumed to be bounded by 0\nand {c^{2}}/{G}=1, in geometrized units. Several results are derived: The\nequation E=mc^2 apparently needs to be modified to\nE^2={s^2c^{10}}/{G^2}+m^2c^4, but a simpler (invariant) parameter is the\n\"energy to length\" ratio, which is {c^4}/{G} for any spherical region of\nspace-time-matter.

We also\nshow that the classical equations of motion describing the time evolution of\nthis system are inequivalent to the standard discrete nonlinear Schreodinger\nequations. By numerically integrating such equations with several initial\nconditions, we show that the system loses coherence, becoming insulating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2007 10:26:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In other cases, the algorithm implements circular row\nand column shifts on the communication schedule to minimize node contention.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2007 15:54:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-15"}

Specifically, we investigate how the different\ntypes of electron orbits, involving one or two centers, affect the interference\npatterns in the spectra. We also briefly address the influence of the choice of\ngauge, and of the initial and final electronic bound states on such patterns.\nFor the length-gauge SFA and undressed bound states, there exist additional\nterms, which can be interpreted as potential energy shifts. If, on the one\nhand, such shifts alter the potential barriers through which the electron\ninitially tunnels, and may lead to a questionable physical interpretation of\nthe features encountered, on the other hand they seem to be necessary in order\nto reproduce the overall maxima and minima in the spectra. Indeed, for dressed\nelectronic bound states in the length gauge, or undressed bound states in the\nvelocity gauge, for which such shifts are absent, there is a breakdown of the\ninterference patterns. In order to avoid such a problem, we provide an\nalternative pathway for the electron to reach the continuum, by means of an\nadditional attosecond-pulse train. A comparison of the purely monochromatic\ncase with the situation for which the attosecond pulses are present suggests\nthat the patterns are due to the interference between the electron orbits which\nfinish at different centers, regardless of whether one or two centers are\ninvolved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2007 15:50:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2007 13:49:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-10"}

The observations target the spectral\nregion of the Ha, [NII] and [SII] emission-lines, but show also deep NaI\nstellar absorption lines that we interpret as produced by stars in the galaxy.\nWe derive rotation curves along the major axis of the galaxy that extend out to\nabout 8 kpc from the center for both the gaseous and the stellar components,\nusing the emission and absorption lines. We derive similar rotation curves\nalong the major axis of the polar ring and point out differences between these\nand the ones of the main galaxy. We identify a small diffuse object visible\nonly in Ha emission and with a low velocity dispersion as a dwarf HII galaxy\nand argue that it is probably metal-poor. Its velocity indicates that it is a\nfourth member of the galaxy group in which AM1934-563 belongs. We discuss the\nobservations in the context of the proposal that the object is the result of a\nmajor merger and point out some observational discrepancies from this\nexplanation.

The fluid in the disk and in\nthe surrounding hotter atmosphere has finite electrical conductivity and allows\nfor the magnetic field to diffuse freely out of the areas where it is\ngenerated, while at the same time, the differential rotation of the disk twists\nthe poloidal field and quickly induces a substantial toroidal--field component.\nThe secular PR term has dual purpose in these simulations as the source of the\nmagnetic field and the trigger of a magnetorotational instability (MRI) in the\ndisk. The MRI is especially mild and does not destroy the disk because a small\namount of resistivity dampens the instability efficiently. In simulations with\nmoderate resistivities (diffusion timescales up to $\\sim$16 local dynamical\ntimes) and after $\\sim$100 orbits, the MRI has managed to transfer outward\nsubstantial amounts of angular momentum and the inner edge of the disk, along\nwith azimuthal magnetic flux, has flowed toward the central point--mass where a\nnew, magnetized, nuclear disk has formed. The toroidal field in this nuclear\ndisk is amplified by differential rotation and it cannot be contained; when it\napproaches equipartition, it unwinds vertically and produces episodic jet--like\noutflows. The poloidal field in the inner region cannot diffuse back out if the\ncharacteristic diffusion time is of the order of or larger than the dynamical\ntime; it continues to grow linearly in time undisturbed and without saturation,\nas the outer sections of many poloidal loops are being drawn radially outward.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2007 18:32:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
