Flare Hard X-Rays (HXRs) from non-thermal electrons are commonly\ntreated as solely bremsstrahlung (f-f), recombination (f-b) being neglected.\nThis assumption is shown to be substantially in error, especially in hot\nsources, mainly due to recombination onto Fe ions.\n  Aims. We analyse the effects on HXR spectra and electron diagnostics by\nincluding non-thermal recombination onto heavy elements in our model.\n  Methods. Using Kramers hydrogenic cross sections with effective Z, we\ncalculate f-f and f-b spectra for power-law electron spectra, in both thin and\nthick target limits, and for Maxwellians, with summation over all important\nions.\n  Results. We find that non-thermal electron recombination, especially onto Fe,\nmust, in general, be included together with f-f, for reliable spectral\ninterpretation, when the HXR source is hot. f-b contribution is greatest when\nthe electron spectral index is large, and any low energy cut-off small. f-b\nspectra recombination edges mean a cut-off in F(E) appears as a HXR feature at\nPhoton energy = Ec + Vz, offering an Ec diagnostic.

In comparison with other bright CTTS we study\npossible signatures of accretion and winds in their X-ray emission. Results: We\nfind three levels of activity among the observations of RU Lup, clearly of\nmagnetic origin due to the corresponding high plasma temperatures. Density\nanalysis with the OVII triplet indicates high densities in the cool plasma,\nsuggesting accretion shocks to be a significant contributor to the soft X-ray\nemission. No strong overall metal depletion is observed. Excess emission at 6.4\nkeV during the more active phase suggest the presence of iron fluorescence. In\naccreting stars we find an excess of cool plasma as evidenced by lower\nOVIII/OVII line ratios compared to main-sequence stars. High density plasma\nappears to be only present in low-mass CTTS, while accreting stars with\nintermediate masses (> 2 M_Sun) have lower densities. Conclusions: In all\ninvestigated CTTS the characteristics of the cooler X-ray emitting plasma are\ninfluenced by the accretion process. We suspect different accretion rates and\namount of funneling, possibly linked to stellar mass and radius, to be mainly\nresponsible for the different properties of their cool plasma component.

Here we use these observations to\nplace constraints on particle acceleration efficiency in intermediate Mach\nnumber (M ~ 2-3) shocks and explore the potential to constrain the contribution\nof nonthermal components (e.g., cosmic rays, magnetic field, and turbulence) to\nICM pressure in cluster outskirts.

At 1\nAU from the Sun, the magnetic structure of MCs is generally modeled neglecting\ntheir expansion during the spacecraft crossing. However, in some cases, MCs\npresent a significant expansion. We present here an analysis of the huge and\nsignificantly expanding MC observed by the Wind spacecraft during 9 and 10\nNovember, 2004. After determining an approximated orientation for the flux rope\nusing the minimum variance method, we precise the orientation of the cloud axis\nrelating its front and rear magnetic discontinuities using a direct method.\nThis method takes into account the conservation of the azimuthal magnetic flux\nbetween the in- and out-bound branches, and is valid for a finite impact\nparameter (i.e., not necessarily a small distance between the spacecraft\ntrajectory and the cloud axis). Moreover, using the direct method, we find that\nthe ICME is formed by a flux rope (MC) followed by an extended coherent\nmagnetic region. These observations are interpreted considering the existence\nof a previous larger flux rope, which partially reconnected with its\nenvironment in the front.

Several examples are then\nprovided to show that adding new edges to a network can either increase or\ndecrease the network synchronizability.

In order to\npursue these goals we present a new class of hydrodynamical simulations for the\nformation of single elliptical galaxies in which we implement detailed\nprescriptions for the chemical evolution of H, He, O and Fe. We find that all\nthe models which predict chemical properties (such as the central mass-weighted\nabundance ratios, the colours as well as the [<Fe/H>] gradient) within the\nobserved ranges for a typical elliptical, also exhibit a variety of gradients\nin the [<alpha/Fe>] ratio, in agreement with the observations (namely positive,\nnull or negative). All these models undergo an outside-in formation, in the\nsense that star formation stops earlier in the outermost than in the innermost\nregions, owing to the onset of a galactic wind. The typical [<Z/H>] gradients\npredicted by our models have a slope of -0.3 dex per decade variation in\nradius, consistent with the mean values of several observational samples. We\ncan safely conclude that the history of star formation is fundamental for the\ncreation of abundance gradients in ellipticals but that radial flows with\ndifferent velocity in conjunction with the duration and efficiency of star\nformation in different galactic regions are responsible for the gradients in\nthe [<alpha/Fe>] ratios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2007 08:03:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Apr 2008 19:29:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Furthermore,\nminima that appear when the range of the potential is shorter and the network\nis larger have smaller basins of attraction.

We show that the entropy profiles are remarkably similar outside\nthe core and can be described by simple power-laws with slope of 1.0-1.2. We\nmeasure an entropy level at 0.1 R_{200} of 100-500 keV cm^2 and a central\nplateau which spans a wide range of value (~ a few-200 keV cm^2) depending on\nthe state of relaxation of the source. To characterize the energetic of the\ncentral regions, we compare the radial behaviour of the temperature of the gas\nwith the temperature of the dark matter T_{DM} by estimating the excess of\nenergy Delta E = 3/2 k(T_{gas}- T_{DM}). We point out that Delta E ranges from\n~ 0 in typical cooling-core clusters to few keV within 100 kpc in non-cooling\ncore systems. We also measure a significant correlation between the total iron\nmass and the entropy outside the cooling region,whereas in the inner regions\nthey anti-correlate strongly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2007 11:55:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2007 10:09:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
