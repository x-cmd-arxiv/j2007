We note first that the\ncorresponding classical Hamiltonian system can be treated as a gauge system,\nwith imaginary part of the Hamiltonian playing the role of the first class\nconstraint. We observe then that, on the basis of this classical problem,\nseveral different nontrivial quantum problems can be formulated. We formulate\nand solve some such problems.

There is an infinite set of phase transitions\nin g when a couple of eigenstates of H coalesce and disappear from the\nspectrum. When quantization is done in the most natural way such that gauge\nconstraints are imposed on quantum states, the spectrum should not be positive\ndefinite, but must involve the negative energy states (ghosts).

In the general case we\nrestrict ourselves to Gaussian distributed matrix elements, but different\nwidths of the various matrix elements are admitted. The following results are\nobtained: An explicit exact formula for $P(S)$ is derived and its behaviour\nclose to S=0 is studied analytically, showing that there is linear level\nrepulsion, unless there are additional constraints for the probability\ndistribution of the matrix elements. The constraint of having only positive or\nonly negative but otherwise arbitrary non-diagonal elements leads to quadratic\nlevel repulsion with logarithmic corrections. These findings detail and extend\nour previous results already published in a preceding paper.

Our sample is by far the largest of its kind, with over 2000\nspectroscopic redshifts in the range 1.9<z<3.4 and ~15000 photometric\ncandidates in 29 independent fields covering a total area of almost a square\ndegree. Our method for computing the LFs takes into account a number of\nsystematic effects, including photometric scatter, Ly-alpha perturbations to\noptical colors, and contaminants.

The UV LF appears to undergo little evolution between z~4 and\nz~2. Corrected for extinction, the UV luminosity density (LD) at z~2 is at\nleast as large as the value at z~3 and a factor of ~9 larger than the value at\nz~6, primarily reflecting an increase in the number density of bright galaxies\nbetween z~6 and z~2.

We try to fit the multiwaveband spectrum using a coupled\naccretion-jet model. In this model, the accretion flow is described by an\nadvection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) while in the innermost region of ADAF\na fraction of accretion flow is transferred into the vertical direction and\nforms a jet. We find that X-ray emission in the source with the highest $L_{\\rm\nX}$ ($\\sim 1.8 \\times 10^{-4}L_{\\rm Edd}$) is from the ADAF. The results for\nthe four sources with moderate $L_{\\rm X}$ ($\\sim$ several $\\times\n10^{-6}L_{\\rm Edd}$) are complicated. Two are mainly from the ADAFs, one from\nthe jet, and the other from the sum of the jet and ADAF. The X-ray emission in\nthe three least luminous sources ($L_{\\rm X} \\lesssim 1.0\\times 10^{-6}L_{\\rm\nEdd}$) is dominated by the jet although for one source it can also be\ninterpreted by the ADAF since the quality of X-ray data is low.

We also investigate the fuel supply in these sources.\nWe find that the accretion rates in four sources among the five in which we can\nhave good constraints to their accretion rates must be higher than the Bondi\nrates. This implies that other fuel supply, such as the gas released by the\nstellar population inside the Bondi radius, should be important.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2007 00:21:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The excellent astrometric accuracy achieved with LGS-AO\nprovides the basis for a detailed comparison with VLT/NAOS-CONICA data taken\n4.3 years earlier. Over the 4.3 year baseline, a spatial displacement of the\nArches cluster with respect to the field population is measured to be 24.0 +/-\n2.2 mas, corresponding to a proper motion of 5.6 +/- 0.5 mas/yr or 212 +/- 29\nkm/s at a distance of 8 kpc. In combination with the known line-of-sight\nvelocity of the cluster, we derive a 3D space motion of 232 +/- 30 km/s of the\nArches relative to the field. The large proper motion of the Arches cannot be\nexplained with any of the closed orbital families observed in gas clouds in the\nbar potential of the inner Galaxy, but would be consistent with the Arches\nbeing on a transitional trajectory from x1 to x2 orbits. We investigate a\ncloud-cloud collision as the possible origin for the Arches cluster. The\nintegration of the cluster orbit in the potential of the inner Galaxy suggests\nthat the cluster passes within 10 pc of the supermassive black hole only if its\ntrue GC distance is very close to its projected distance. A contribution of\nyoung stars from the Arches cluster to the young stellar population in the\ninner few parsecs of the GC thus appears increasingly unlikely.

The physical origin of\nthese oscillations comes from the finite size of the strained islands. The 2D\nislands may thus relax by their edges, leading to in-plane lattice spacing\noscillations during the birth and spread of these islands. On the one hand, we\nformulate the problem of elastic relaxation of a coherent 2D epitaxial deposits\nby using the concept of point forces and demonstrate that the mean deformation\nin the islands exhibits an oscillatory behaviour.

This Cowling resistivity can exceed the Spitzer\nresistivity by orders of magnitude and in 2.5D simulations has been shown to be\nsufficient to remove all cross field current from emerging flux.

The code follows the three\ndimensional distribution of dust in a protoplanetary disk as it interacts with\nthe gas via aerodynamic drag. In this work, we present the evolution of a disk\ncomprising 1% dust by mass in the presence of an embedded planet for two\ndifferent disk configurations: a small, minimum mass solar nebular (MMSN) disk\nand a larger, more massive Classical T Tauri star (CTTS) disk. We then vary the\ngrain size and planetary mass to see how they effect the resulting disk\nstructure. We find that gap formation is much more rapid and striking in the\ndust layer than in the gaseous disk and that a system with a given stellar,\ndisk and planetary mass will have a different appearance depending on the grain\nsize and that such differences will be detectable in the millimetre domain with\nALMA. For low mass planets in our MMSN models, a gap can open in the dust disk\nwhile not in the gas disk. We also note that dust accumulates at the external\nedge of the planetary gap and speculate that the presence of a planet in the\ndisk may facilitate the growth of planetesimals in this high density region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2007 15:45:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
