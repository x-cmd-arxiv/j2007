While all these events result from the death of\nmassive stars, the electromagnetic luminosities of GRBs and XRFs exceed those\nof ordinary Type Ibc SNe by many orders of magnitude. The observed diversity of\nstellar death corresponds to large variations in the energy, velocity, and\ngeometry of the explosion ejecta. Using multi-wavelength (radio, optical,\nX-ray) observations of the nearest GRBs, XRFs, and SNe Ibc, I show that while\nGRBs and XRFs couple at least 10^48 erg to relativistic material, SNe Ibc\ntypically couple less than 10^48 erg to their fastest (albeit non-relativistic)\noutflows. Specifically, I find that less than 3% of local SNe Ibc show any\nevidence for association with a GRB or XRF. Recently, a new class of GRBs and\nXRFs has been revealed which are under-luminous in comparison with the\nstatistical sample of GRBs. Owing to their faint high-energy emission, these\nsub-energetic bursts are only detectable nearby (z < 0.1) and are likely 10\ntimes more common than cosmological GRBs. In comparison with local SNe Ibc and\ntypical GRBs/XRFs, these explosions are intermediate in terms of both\nvolumetric rate and energetics. Yet the essential physical process that causes\na dying star to produce a GRB, XRF, or sub-energetic burst, and not just a SN,\nremains a crucial open question. Progress requires a detailed understanding of\nordinary SNe Ibc which will be facilitated with the launch of wide-field\noptical surveys in the near future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2007 20:00:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

A complete catalogue of 142 sources (120 galaxies and 22 stars),\ndetected with high significance (equivalent to 5sigma), is presented above an\nintegrated flux density of 0.24mJy. Star/galaxy separation is performed by a\ndetailed study of colour-colour diagrams. The catalogue is complete to 1mJy and\nbelow this flux density the incompleteness is corrected using two independent\nmethods. The first method uses stars and the second uses optical counterparts\nof the ISOCAM galaxies; these methods yield consistent results. We also apply\nan empirical flux density calibration using stars in the field. For each star,\nthe 12um flux density is derived by fitting optical colours from a multi-band\nchi^2 to stellar templates (BaSel-2.0) and using empirical optical-IR\ncolour-colour relations. This article is a companion analysis to\nRocca-Volmerange 2007 et al. where the 12um faint galaxy counts are presented\nand analysed by galaxy type with the evolutionary code PEGASE.3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2007 22:30:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Missing energy and/or recoil mass\ndistributions of the unparticle in the associated production of unparticle\ntogether with a photon or $Z$ boson at LEP2 and ILC as well as in $Z$ decay\ninto an unparticle plus a fermion-antifermion pair are studied. Monojet\nproduction at hadronic collisions is explored. The complex phase in the\nunparticle propagator that can give rise to interesting interference effects\nbetween an unparticle exchange diagram and the standard model amplitudes are\nstudied in details for the Drell-Yan process as well as muon pair and diphoton\nproduction in electron-positron annihilation. These energy and/or recoil mass\ndistributions (with the exception in hadron colliders) and interference effects\nare found sensitively depending not only on the scale dimension but also on the\nspin of the unparticle. For the spin-2 unparticle, its physical effects is\nfound to resemble that of a tower of Kaluza-Klein gravitons, which strongly\nindicates that the underlying unparticle physics may have root in a higher\ndimensional theory. A connection between unparticle physics and theories of\nlarge extra dimension is speculated. Experimental constraints on the unparticle\nscale are deduced from the LEP2 data on mono-photon production and from the\n4-fermion contact interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2007 14:04:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 Jul 2007 08:42:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Combining\nthe complementary strength of dynamical low-energy electron diffraction,\nscanning tunneling microscopy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we\nrecently showed that besides monovalent and divalent adsorbates, trivalent\nadsorbates are also able to stabilize silicon honeycomb chains. Consequently\nsilicon honeycomb chains emerge as a most stable, universal building block\nshared by many atomic chain structures. We here present the systematics behind\nthe self-assembly mechanism of these chain systems and relate the valence state\nof the adsorbate to the accessible symmetries of the chains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2007 15:29:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-05"}

One approach to understanding the emergence of this\nresponse is to state that neural activity has to efficiently represent sensory\ndata with respect to the statistics of natural scenes. Furthermore, it is\nbelieved that such an efficient coding is achieved using a competition across\nneurons so as to generate a sparse representation, that is, where a relatively\nsmall number of neurons are simultaneously active. Indeed, different models of\nsparse coding, coupled with Hebbian learning and homeostasis, have been\nproposed that successfully match the observed emergent response. However, the\nspecific role of homeostasis in learning such sparse representations is still\nlargely unknown. By quantitatively assessing the efficiency of the neural\nrepresentation during learning, we derive a cooperative homeostasis mechanism\nthat optimally tunes the competition between neurons within the sparse coding\nalgorithm. We apply this homeostasis while learning small patches taken from\nnatural images and compare its efficiency with state-of-the-art algorithms.\nResults show that while different sparse coding algorithms give similar coding\nresults, the homeostasis provides an optimal balance for the representation of\nnatural images within the population of neurons. Competition in sparse coding\nis optimized when it is fair. By contributing to optimizing statistical\ncompetition across neurons, homeostasis is crucial in providing a more\nefficient solution to the emergence of independent components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2007 15:32:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2007 12:44:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2008 08:10:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 19 Mar 2008 08:00:43 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 19 Sep 2008 19:26:23 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2010 13:33:29 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2016 12:52:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-09"}

Supernova remnants containing magnetars do not\nshow the excess of kinetic energy expected for such a formation scenario, nor\nis there any evidence for a relic pulsar wind nebula. However, it could be that\nmagnetars are formed with somewhat slower rotation periods, or that not all\nexcess rotational energy was used to boost the explosion energy, for example as\na result of gravitational radiation. Another observational tests for the rapid\ninitial period hypothesis is to look for statistical evidence that about 1% of\nthe observed supernovae have an additional 1E40-1E44 erg/s excess energy during\nthe first year, caused by the spin down luminosity of a magnetar. An\nalternative scenario for the high magnetic fields of magnetars is the fossil\nfield hypothesis, in which the magnetic field is inherited from the progenitor\nstar. Direct observational tests for this hypothesis are harder to formulate,\nunless the neutron star formed in the SN1987A explosion emerges as a slowly\nrotating magnetar. Finally, I point out the possible connection between the\njets in Cas A and its X-ray point source: the jets in Cas A may indicate that\nthe explosion was accompanied by an X-ray flash, probably powered by a rapidly\nrotating compact object. However, the point source in Cas A does not seem to be\na rapidly rotating neutron star, suggesting that the neutron star has slowed\ndown considerably in 330 yr, requiring a magnetar-like field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2007 15:48:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
