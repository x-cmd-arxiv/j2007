The pole structure of the\nmodular form leads to a contour dependence in the counting formula obscuring\nits duality invariance. We exhibit the relation between this ambiguity and the\n(dis-)appearance of bound states of 1/2-BPS configurations. Using this insight\nwe propose a precise moduli-dependent contour prescription for the counting\nformula. We then show that the degeneracies are duality-invariant and are\ncorrectly adjusted at the walls of marginal stability to account for the\n(dis-)appearance of the two-centered bound states. Especially, for large black\nholes none of these bound states exists at the attractor point and none of\nthese ambiguous poles contributes to the counting formula. Using this fact we\nalso propose a second, moduli-independent contour which counts the \"immortal\ndyons\" that are stable everywhere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jun 2007 08:01:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Oct 2008 20:27:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-18"}

Comparing with the known\n$R_{\\rm BLR}-L$ relation, we can get the factor $f$, which indicates BLRs'\ngeometry, inclination and kinematics. We find that $f$ far deviates from 0.75,\nsuggesting the non-virial dynamics of broad line regions. The peak separation\nis mildly correlated with the Eddington ratio and SMBH mass with almost the\nsame correlation coefficients. It implies that it is difficult to detect\nobvious double-peak AGNs with higher Eddington ratios. Using the monochromatic\nluminosity at 5100\\AA to trace the bolometric luminosity, we find that the\nexternal illumination of the accretion disk is needed to produce the observed\nstrength of H$\\alpha$ emission line.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jun 2007 13:33:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Over the past 20 years,\nstudies have demonstrated that the behavior of cellular automata drastically\nchanged under asynchronous updates. Still, the few mathematical analyses of\nasynchronism focus on one-dimensional probabilistic cellular automata, either\non single examples or on specific classes. As for other classic dynamical\nsystems in physics, extending known methods from one- to two-dimensional\nsystems is a long lasting challenging problem.\n  In this paper, we address the problem of analysing an apparently simple 2D\nasynchronous cellular automaton: 2D Minority where each cell, when fired,\nupdates to the minority state of its neighborhood. Our experiments reveal that\nin spite of its simplicity, the minority rule exhibits a quite complex response\nto asynchronism. By focusing on the fully asynchronous regime, we are however\nable to describe completely the asymptotic behavior of this dynamics as long as\nthe initial configuration satisfies some natural constraints. Besides these\ntechnical results, we have strong reasons to believe that our techniques\nrelying on defining an energy function from the transition table of the\nautomaton may be extended to the wider class of threshold automata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jun 2007 14:12:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-19"}
