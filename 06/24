The physical mechanism\nunderlying coherently controlled stationary state scattering is exposed by\nanalyzing a control scenario that relies on previously established entanglement\nrequirements between the scattering partners. Specifically, initial state\nentanglement assures that all collisions in the scattering volume yield the\ndesirable scattering configuration. Scattering is controlled by preparing the\nparticular internal state wave function that leads to the favored collisional\nconfiguration in the collision volume. This insight allows coherent control to\nbe extended to the case of time-dependent scattering. Specifically, we identify\nreactive scattering scenarios using incident wave packets of translational\nmotion where coherent control is operational and initial state entanglement is\nunnecessary. Both the stationary and time-dependent scenarios incorporate\nextended coherence features, making them physically distinct. From a\ntheoretical point of view, this work represents a large step forward in the\nqualitative understanding of coherently controlled reactive scattering.

Niikura et al., Nature (London) 421, 826\n(2003)] from a coherent control perspective. In this process, a strong laser\nfield incident on D2 ionizes an electron, accelerates the electron in the laser\nfield to eV energies, and then drives the electron to recollide with the parent\nion, causing D2+ dissociation. A number of results are demonstrated. First, a\nfull dimensional Strong Field Approximation (SFA) model is constructed and\nshown to be in agreement with the original experiment. This is then used to\nrigorously demonstrate that the experiment is an example of coherent pump-dump\ncontrol. Second, extensions to bichromatic coherent control are proposed by\nconsidering dissociative recollision of molecules prepared in a coherent\nsuperposition of vibrational states. Third, by comparing the results to similar\nscenarios involving field-free attosecond scattering of independently prepared\nD2+ and electron wave packets, recollision dissociation is shown to provide an\nexample of wave-packet coherent control of reactive scattering. Fourth, this\nanalysis makes clear that it is the temporal correlations between the continuum\nelectron and D2+ wave packet, and not entanglement, that are crucial for the\nsub-femtosecond probing resolution demonstrated in the experiment. This result\nclarifies some misconceptions regarding the importance of entanglement in the\nrecollision probing of D2+. Finally, signatures of entanglement between the\nrecollision electron and the atomic fragments, detectable via coincidence\nmeasurements, are identified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jun 2007 18:22:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

This theory yields a golden section\nsplit of votes (or the series of Fibonacci numbers, for the case of multiple\nchoice). A typology of political campaigns based on this theory is proposed. A\nproximity of ratings of competing persons means the highest electoral tension,\na leadership of a person means a high level of mobilization; a neutral\nsituation corresponds to Fibonacci numbers distribution of votes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jun 2007 15:31:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-26"}

The law involves a\nDugdale-Barenblatt static description of crack tip plastic zones associated to\nan Eyring's law and an empirical dependence with the crack length that may come\nfrom a residual elastic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jun 2007 15:48:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
