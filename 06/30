We show that the number of hulls per unit area,\n$n_h(A,t) dA$, with enclosed area in the interval $(A,A+dA)$, is described, for\na disordered initial condition, by the scaling function $n_h(A,t) = 2c_h/(A +\n\\lambda_h t)^2$, where $c_h=1/8\\pi\\sqrt{3} \\approx 0.023$ is a universal\nconstant and $\\lambda_h$ is a material parameter. For a critical initial\ncondition, the same form is obtained, with the same $\\lambda_h$ but with $c_h$\nreplaced by $c_h/2$. For the distribution of domain areas, we argue that the\ncorresponding scaling function has, for random initial conditions, the form\n$n_d(A,t) = 2c_d (\\lambda_d t)^{\\tau'-2}/(A + \\lambda_d t)^{\\tau'}$, where\n$c_d=c_h + {\\cal O}(c_h^2)$, $\\lambda_d=\\lambda_h + {\\cal O}(c_h)$, and $\\tau'\n= 187/91 \\approx 2.055$.

While there is\ngeneral agreement that the X-rays are produced by a population of high-energy\nelectrons near to the BH, the controversy comes about in modeling the\ncontribution from inflowing vs. outflowing particles, and their relative energy\nbudget. Recent Spitzer observations of three quiescent BHBs have shown evidence\nfor excess emission with respect to the tail of the companion star between 8-24\nmicron. We suggest that synchrotron emission from a partially self-absorbed\noutflow might be responsible for the observed mid-IR excess, in place of, or in\naddition to, thermal emission from circumbinary material. If so, then the jet\nsynchrotron luminosity exceeds the measured 2-10 keV luminosity by a factor of\na few in these systems. In turn, the mechanical power stored in the jet exceeds\nthe bolometric X-ray luminosity at least by 4 orders of magnitude. We then\ncompile the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of A0620-00, the\nlowest Eddington-ratio stellar mass BH with a known radio counterpart, by means\nof simultaneous radio, optical and X-ray observations, and the archival Spitzer\ndata. We are able to fit the SED of A0620-00 with a `maximally jet-dominated'\nmodel in which the radio through the soft X-rays are dominated by synchrotron\nemission, while the hard X-rays are dominated by inverse Compton at the jet\nbase. The fitted parameters land in a range of values that is reminiscent of\nthe Galactic Center super-massive BH Sgr A*. Most notably, the inferred ratio\nof the jet acceleration rate to local cooling rates is two orders of magnitude\nweaker with respect to higher luminosity, hard state sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jun 2007 00:05:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The use of molecules as couplers between far-field and near-field\nlight offers the advantages that no special excitation geometry is needed, any\nlight source can be used to excite plasmons and the excitation can be localized\nbelow the diffraction limit. Moreover, the use of molecules has the potential\nfor integration with molecular electronics and for the use of molecular\nself-assembly in fabrication. Our results constitute a proof-of-principle\ndemonstration of a plasmonic waveguide where signal in- and outcoupling is done\nby molecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jun 2007 09:40:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2007 19:50:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
