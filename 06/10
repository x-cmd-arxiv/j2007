The nature of the compact object and the origin of the\nhigh-energy emission are unclear. One family of models invokes particle\nacceleration in shocks from the collision between the B-star wind and a\nrelativistic pulsar wind, while another centers on a relativistic jet powered\nby accretion. Recent high-resolution radio observations showing a putative\n\"cometary tail\" pointing away from the Be star near periastron have been cited\nas support for the pulsar-wind model. We wish here to carry out a quantitative\nassessment of these competing models for this extraordinary source. We apply a\n3D SPH code for dynamical simulations of both the pulsar-wind-interaction and\naccretion-jet models. The former yields a description of the shape of the\nwind-wind interaction surface. The latter provides an estimation of the\naccretion rate. The results allow critical evaluation of how the two distinct\nmodels confront the data in various wavebands under a range of conditions. When\none accounts for the 3D dynamical wind interaction under realistic constraints\nfor the relative strength of the B-star and pulsar winds, the resulting form of\nthe interaction front does not match the putative \"cometary tail\" claimed from\nradio observations. On the other hand, dynamical simulations of the\naccretion-jet model indicate that the orbital phase variation of accretion\npower includes a secondary broad peak well away from periastron, thus providing\na plausible way to explain the observed TeV gamma ray emission toward apastron.\nWe conclude that the colliding-wind model is not clearly established for LS I\n+61 303, while the accretion-jet model can reproduce many key characteristics\nof the observed TeV gamma-ray emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jun 2007 16:32:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2007 21:08:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-03"}

The angular distribution of satellites about their host is\nbiased towards the major axes for spheroidal galaxies and probably also for red\ndisc galaxies, but is isotropic for blue disc galaxies, i.e. it is the colour\nof the host that determines the distribution of its satellites rather than its\nmorphology.

Finally, we discuss the relation between this latter solution\nand the D4-D8 brane system, showing how it represents a generalisation of the\nDW/Cosmology correspondence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jun 2007 15:20:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We find that at low temperatures T the curvature\napproaches at large R>l an R independent M*>M, where l is the mean free path in\nthe metal. This behavior is also consistent with perturbation theory in the\nparticle - metal coupling parameter. At finite temperature T we identify\ndephasing lengths that scale as T^{-1} at R>l and as T^{-1/4} at R<<l.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jun 2007 15:58:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2007 17:12:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Jul 2008 15:23:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
