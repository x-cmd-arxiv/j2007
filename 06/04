While, at\n10000 K, the bulky gas would absorb Lyman lines fully, at 50000K it emits\nsuperradiant lines. As superradiance de-excites the atoms strongly, nearly all\navailable energy is emitted in a few competing modes: Superradiance appears\nonly for beams which cross the largest column densities; for an observation\nfrom Earth, these beams generate three elliptical hollow cylinders whose bases\nare the observed rings; admitting that the Earth is not in a privileged\ndirection, these cylinders envelope ellipsoidal shells observed, for the\nexternal rings, by photon echoes.

We track the most populated genotype as it changes when the population\njumps from a fitness peak to a better one during the process of adaptation.\nThis is done using the dynamics of the shell model which is a simplified\nversion of the quasispecies model for infinite populations and standard\nWright-Fisher dynamics for large finite populations. We show that the\npopulation fraction of a genotype obtained within the quasispecies model and\nthe shell model match for fit genotypes and at short times, but the dynamics of\nthe two models are identical for questions related to the most populated\ngenotype. We calculate exactly several properties of the jumps in infinite\npopulations some of which were obtained numerically in previous works. We also\npresent our preliminary simulation results for finite populations. In\nparticular, we measure the jump distribution in time and find that it decays as\n$t^{-2}$ as in the quasispecies problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2007 10:09:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Aug 2007 16:13:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The evidence includes the evolution of X-ray afterglows (when X-rays\nare below the cooling frequency), the evolution of the pre-jet break optical\nand X-ray afterglow, and the sharp turn-on observed for some afterglows. Recent\nobservations of short bursts, which are expected to be interacting with a\nconstant density medium, provide a check on the standard afterglow model.\nAlthough radio observations do not support the constant density model for long\nbursts in some cases, the evidence for constant density interaction is strong.\nThe most plausible way to produce such a medium around a massive star is to\nshock the progenitor wind. This requires a smaller termination shock than would\nbe expected, possibly due to a high pressure surroundings, a high progenitor\nvelocity, or the particular evolution leading to a GRB. However, the need for\nthe termination shock near the deceleration radius cannot be plausibly\naccomodated and may indicate that some long bursts have compact binary\nprogenitors and explode directly into the interstellar medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2007 15:41:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-05"}

Fault detection and classification were\nperformed by comparing predicted recipe and wafer state values with expected\nvalues.
