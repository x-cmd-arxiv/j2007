The vegetation reflectance has indeed a specific\nspectrum, with a sharp edge around 700 nm, known as the \"Vegetation Red Edge\"\n(VRE). Moreover vegetation covers a large surface of emerged lands, from\ntropical evergreen forest to shrub tundra. Thus considering it as a potential\nglobal biomarker is relevant. Earthshine allows to observe the Earth as a\ndistant planet, i.e. without spatial resolution. Since 2001, Earthshine\nobservations have been used by several authors to test and quantify the\ndetectability of the VRE in the Earth spectrum. The egetation spectral\nsignature is detected as a small 'positive shift' of a few percents above the\ncontinuum, starting at 700 nm. This signature appears in most spectra, and its\nstrength is correlated with the Earth's phase (visible land versus visible\nocean). The observations show that detecting the VRE on Earth requires a\nphotometric relative accuracy of 1% or better.

In this paper, we present CFHT/CFH12K\nphotometric and Keck/LRIS multiobject spectroscopic observations of a sample of\n22 white dwarfs in two older open clusters, NGC 7789 (t = 1.4 Gyr) and NGC 6819\n(t = 2.5 Gyr).

The simplest model\nrelies on two scalar fields, whose entropy perturbation leads to a\nscale-invariant spectrum of density fluctuations. The ekpyrotic solution has a\ntachyonic instability along the entropy field direction which, a priori,\nappears to require fine-tuning of the initial conditions. In this paper, we\nshow that these can be achieved naturally by adding a small positive mass term\nfor the tachyonic field and coupling to light fermions. Then, for a wide range\nof initial conditions, the tachyonic field gets stabilized with the appropriate\nvalues well before the onset of the ekpyrotic phase. Furthermore, we show that\nekpyrotic theory is successful in solving the flatness, horizon and homogeneity\nproblems of standard big bang cosmology. Motivated by the analysis of the\ntachyonic instability, we propose a simplification of the model in terms of new\nfield variables. Instead of requiring two exponential potentials, one for each\nscalar field, it suffices to consider a single nearly exponential potential for\none of the fields and a tachyonic mass term along the orthogonal direction in\nfield space. All other terms in the potential are essentially arbitrary. This\ngreatly widens the class of ekpyrotic potentials and allows substantial freedom\nin determining the spectral index and possible non-Gaussianity.

Including the alignment of\nsource galaxies, the full noise variance from intrinsic ellipticites in\nconvergence $\\kappa$-maps can be written as\n$\\sigma^2_0=\\sigma^2_{0ran}+\\sigma^2_{0corr}$, where $\\sigma^2_{0ran}$ is the\nnoise contributed from randomly oriented source galaxies and $\\sigma^2_{0corr}$\ndenotes the additional noise from intrinsic alignments. However, it is\nobservationally difficult to measure $\\sigma^2_{0corr}$ and usually only\n$\\sigma^2_{0ran}$ can be estimated in weak lensing observations. Thus the\nobservational signal-to-noise ratio is often defined with respect to\n$\\sigma_{0ran}$, which is denoted as $\\nu_{ran}$ in this paper. The true\nsignal-to-noise ratio $\\nu$ in terms of $\\sigma_0$ is then\n$\\nu=\\nu_{ran}/(1+\\sigma^2_{0corr}/\\sigma^2_{0ran})^{1/2}$. Given a detection\nthreshold on $\\nu_{ran}$, a larger value of $\\sigma^2_{0corr}/\\sigma^2_{0ran}$\nleads to a lower threshold on $\\nu$ and therefore a larger expected number of\nfalse peaks. With $\\sigma^2_{0corr}/\\sigma^2_{0ran}\\sim 10%$, the average\nnumber of false peaks with $\\nu_{ran}\\ge 3.5$ nearly doubles compared to that\nwithout considering the alignment, and for $\\nu_{ran}\\ge 5$, the number is\ntripled. As a result, the efficiency of weak lensing cluster detection degrades\nsignificantly.

We\nconsider briefly a range of phenomena, but concentrate at the extremes of high\nand low gas flow rate, which might represent the more likely behaviors.\nExtremely fast i.e., explosive, expulsion of gas from the surface is\ninvestigated by examining the minimal amount of gas needed to displace a plug\nof regolith above a site of gaseous overpressure at the regolith's base. The\narea and timescale of this disturbance, it is consistent with observed TLPs.\nFurthermore there are several ways in which such an explosion might be expected\nto change the lunar surface appearance in a way consistent with many TLPs,\nincluding production of obscuration, brightening and color changes. At the slow\nend of the volatile flow range, gas seeping from the interior is retained below\nthe surface for extensive times due to the low diffusivity of regolith\nmaterial. A special circumstance arises if the volatile flow contains water\nvapor, because water is uniquely capable of freezing as it passes from the base\nto the surface of the regolith. For a large TLP site, it is plausible to think\nof areas on the square-km scale accumulating significant bodies of water ice.\nFurthermore, as the system evolves over geological time, the ice accumulation\nzone will evolve downwards into the regolith. Since many reactions possible\nbetween the volatiles and regolith, depending on the additional gases besides\nwater, can act to decrease diffusivity in the regolith, it is plausible that\nthe volatiles produce a barrier between the seepage source and vacuum, forcing\nthe ice zone to expand to larger areas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2007 03:48:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-19"}
