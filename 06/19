Here we discuss one possible\nsource of emittance dilution, the coupler kick, due to transverse\nelectromagnetic fields in the accelerating cavities of the linac caused by the\npower coupler geometry. In addition to emittance growth, the coupler kick also\nproduces orbit distortions. It is common wisdom that emittance growth from\ncoupler kicks can be strongly reduced by using two couplers per cavity mounted\nopposite each other or by having the couplers of successive cavities\nalternation from above to below the beam pipe so as to cancel each individual\nkick. We therefore analyze consequences of alternate coupler placements.\n  We show here that for sufficiently large Q values, alternating the coupler\nlocation from before to after the cavity leads to a cancellation of the orbit\ndistortion but not of the emittance growth, whereas alternating the coupler\nlocation from before and above to behind and below the cavity cancels the\nemittance growth but not the orbit distortion. These compensations hold even\nwhen each cavity is individually detuned, e.g. by microphonics. Another\neffective method for reducing coupler kicks that is studied is the optimization\nof the phase of the coupler kick. This technique is independent of the coupler\ngeometry but relies on operating on crest. A final technique studied is\nsymmetrization of the cavity geometry in the coupler region with the addition\nof a stub opposite the coupler, which reduces the amplitude of the off axis\nfields and is thus effective for off crest acceleration as well.\n  We show applications of these techniques to the energy recovery linac (ERL)\nplanned at Cornell University.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2007 20:49:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2007 02:30:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 6 Sep 2007 00:11:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

In this article we describe a college course for\nnon-science majors, The Physics of Dance. The central theme of this course is\nthe personalization of the physics of motion by making each student the object.\nWith this approach we give students not only scientific tools to measure and\nunderstand but personal involvement to experience forces and motion. This\ncombination provides a bridge that connects the science to reality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2007 05:48:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-20"}

Methods: We measured\nspectroscopic redshifts of about 400 compact object candidates with 19.2 < V <\n22.4 mag in the central region of the Centaurus galaxy cluster (d=43Mpc), using\nVIMOS@VLT. The luminosity range of the candidates covers that of bright\nglobular clusters (GCs) and of UCDs in Fornax and Virgo. Results: We confirm\nthe cluster membership of 27 compact objects, covering an absolute magnitude\nrange -12.2 < M_V < -10.9 mag. We do not find counterparts to the two very\nlarge and bright UCDs in Fornax and Virgo with M_V=-13.5 mag, possibly due to\nsurvey incompleteness. The compact objects' distribution in magnitude and space\nis consistent with that of the GC population.

The compact objects have a mean metallicity consistent with\nthat of the metal-rich globular cluster sub-population. Compact objects with\nhigh S/N spectra exhibit solar [alpha/Fe] abundances, consistent with typical\ndwarf elliptical galaxy values and unlike galactic bulge globular clusters.

Using bosonization methods, we show that the anomalous\nscaling dimensions vanish when the number of coupled chains goes to infinity,\nimplying the Fermi liquid behavior of a 2D system in that limit. However, when\nthe Fermi level is at the Van Hove singularity arising from the saddle points\nof the 2D dispersion, backscattering and Cooper-pair scattering lead to the\nbreakdown of the metallic behavior at low energies.

This\nmetric, for arbitrary memoryless channels, achieves the capacity of a composite\n(more noisy) channel.
