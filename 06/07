We use a standard analysis of\nthe halo density profiles and compare the old simulations to new ones performed\nwith Gadget2, including higher resolution runs. We confirm Ricotti's result\nthat, at virialization, the central log slopes alpha, at 5%-10% of the virial\nradius are correlated with the halo mass and that the halo concentration is a\nuniversal constant. Our results do not contradict the majority of published\npapers: when using a split power law to fit the density profiles, due to the\nalpha-concentration degeneracy, the fits are consistent with halos having a\nuniversal shape with alpha=1 or 1.5 and concentrations that depend on the mass,\nin agreement with results published elsewhere.\n  Recently, several groups have found no evidence for convergence of the inner\nhalo profile to a constant power law. The choice of a split power law\nparameterization used in this letter is motivated by the need to compare our\nresults to previous ones and is formally valid because we are not able to\nresolve regions where the slope of the fitting function reaches its asymptotic\nconstant value. Using a non-parameterized technique, we also show that the\ndensity profiles of dwarf galaxies at z ~ 10 have a log slope shallower than\n0.5 within 5% of the virial radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2007 16:13:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Strong irradiation of the accretion curtain and that of\nthe inner regions of the disc led to strong emission of HeII and to the\nsuppression of the Hg and Hb emission.\n  Disc overflow was observed in quiescence in earlier studies, where the\noverflow stream material was modulated at high velocities close to 1000 km/s.\nIn outburst, the overflowing material is modulated at even higher velocities\n(~1500 km/s). These are streaming velocities down the field lines close to the\nwhite dwarf. Evidence for material collecting near the outer edge of the disc\nand corotating with the accretion curtain was observed. In decline, this\nmaterial and the accretion curtain obscured almost all the emission near binary\nphase 0.4, causing a dip. The dip minimum nearly corresponds with spin pulse\nminimum. This has provided additional evidence for an extended accretion\ncurtain, and for the corotation of material with the accretion curtain at the\nouter edge of the disc. From these observations we suggest that a mechanism\nsimilar to that of Spruit & Taam, where outbursts result due to the storage and\nrelease of matter outside the magnetosphere, triggers the outbursts of EX Hya.\nThis is followed by the irradiation of the secondary star due to accretion\ninduced radiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2007 18:34:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

After taking into account previously neglected natural\nbroadening of the resonance line, we find that photons approach the resonance\nfrequency and experience most scatterings at a significantly smaller distance\nfrom the source than naively expected r=(dnu/nu_0)(c/H), where dnu=nu-nu_0 is\nthe initial frequency offset, and the discrepancy increases as the initial\nfrequency offset decreases. As a consequence, the scattering rate P(r) drops\nmuch faster with increasing distance than the previously assumed 1/r^2 profile.\nNear the source (r<1Mpc comoving), the scattering rate of photons that redshift\ninto the Ly_alpha resonance converges to P(r) \\propto r^{-7/3}. The scattering\nrate of Ly_alpha photons produced by splitting of photons that redshift into a\nhigher resonance (Ly_gamma, Ly_delta, etc.) is only weakly affected by the\nradiative transfer, while the sum of scattering rates of Ly_alpha photons\nproduced from all higher resonances also converges to P(r) \\propto r^{-7/3}\nnear the source.

In particular, the\ncorrelation between infrared colors and SiO maser intensity ratio among the\nJ=1-0 v=1, 2, and 3 lines are mainly concerned in this paper.

We show that in the context of security protocols, and in particular\nof anonymizing protocols, this gives the adversary too much power; for\ninstance, the contents of encrypted messages and internal computations by the\nparties should be considered invisible to the adversary.\n  We restrict the class of schedulers to a class of admissible schedulers which\nbetter model adversarial behaviour. These admissible schedulers base their\ndecision solely on the past behaviour of the system that is visible to the\nadversary.\n  Using this, we propose a definition of anonymity: for all admissible\nschedulers the identity of the users and the observations of the adversary are\nindependent stochastic variables. We also develop a proof technique for typical\ncases that can be used to proof anonymity: a system is anonymous if it is\npossible to `exchange' the behaviour of two users without the adversary\n`noticing'.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2007 15:17:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-08"}
