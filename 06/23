Validity of an effective field theory on the\nstandard model (SM) brane requires that the position of the SM brane during\ninflation be different from the position after inflation. The latter is\nsupposed to be near the tip of the SM throat but the former is not. After\ninflation, when the Hubble expansion rate becomes sufficiently low, the SM\nbrane starts moving towards the tip and eventually oscillates. The SM fields\nare excited by the brane motion and the universe is reheated. Since interaction\nbetween the brane position modulus and the SM fields is suppressed only by the\nlocal string scale, the modulus effectively decays into the SM fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jun 2007 19:46:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2007 02:52:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 5 Oct 2008 21:50:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In physical systems, errors are not likely to be\narbitrary; rather we will have reasonable models for the structure of quantum\ndecoherence. We may choose quantum error correcting codes and recovery\noperations that specifically target the most likely errors.\n  We present a convex optimization method to determine the optimal (in terms of\naverage entanglement fidelity) recovery operation for a given channel,\nencoding, and information source. This is solvable via a semidefinite program\n(SDP). We present computational algorithms to generate near-optimal recovery\noperations structured to begin with a projective syndrome measurement. These\nstructured operations are more computationally scalable than the SDP required\nfor computing the optimal; we can thus numerically analyze longer codes. Using\nLagrange duality, we bound the performance of the structured recovery\noperations and show that they are nearly optimal in many relevant cases.\n  We present two classes of channel-adapted quantum error correcting codes\nspecifically designed for the amplitude damping channel. These have\nsignificantly higher rates with shorter block lengths than corresponding\ngeneric quantum error correcting codes. Both classes are stabilizer codes, and\nhave good fidelity performance with stabilizer recovery operations. The\nencoding, syndrome measurement, and syndrome recovery operations can all be\nimplemented with Clifford group operations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jun 2007 19:54:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-26"}

This is the first\nstudy to extend the techinques of Salim et al. 2005 to estimate stellar masses,\nstar formation rates (SFR) and the b (star formation history) parameter for\nstar-forming galaxies out to z~0.7. We obtain redshifts for 50 GALEX MIS\nsources reaching NUV=23.9 (AB mag), having counterparts in the SDSS Data\nRelease 4 (DR4). Of our sample, 43 are starforming galaxies with z<0.7, 3 have\nemission line ratios indicative of AGN with z<0.7, and 4 objects with z~1 are\nQSOs, 3 of which are not previously cataloged. We compare our sample to a much\nlarger sample of ~50,000 matched GALEX/SDSS galaxies with SDSS spectroscopy;\nwhile our survey is shallow, the optical counterparts to our sources reach ~3\nmagnitudes fainter in SDSS r magnitude than the SDSS spectroscopic sample. We\nuse emission line diagnostics for the galaxies to determine that the sample\ncontains mostly star-forming galaxies. The galaxies in the sample populate the\nblue sequence in the NUV-r vs M_r color-magnitude diagram. Our sample has SFRs,\nluminosities, and velocity dispersions that are similar to the samples of faint\ncompact blue galaxies studied previously in the same redshift range by Koo et.\nal 1995, Guzman et. al 1996 & Phillips et. al 1997. However, our sample is ~2\nmag fainter in surface brightness than the compact blue galaxies. We find that\nthe star-formation histories for a majority of the galaxies are consistent with\na recent starburst within the last 100 Myr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jun 2007 02:01:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Dynamic spectra were obtained from datasets of 90 min duration and\ndiffractive parameters derived from a two-dimensional auto-correlation\nanalysis. Secondary spectra were also computed but these showed no significant\nevidence for arc structure. Cross correlations between variations in the\nderived parameters were much lower than predicted by thin screen models and in\none case was of opposite sign to the prediction. Observed modulation indices\nwere larger than predicted by thin screen models with a Kolmogorov fluctuation\nspectrum. Structure functions were computed for the flux density, diffractive\ntimescale and decorrelation bandwidth. These indicated a refractive timescale\nof $8\\pm 2$ h, much shorter than predicted by the thin screen model. The\nmeasured structure-function slope of $0.4\\pm 0.2$ is also inconsistent with\nscattering by a single thin screen for which a slope of 2.0 is expected. All\nobservations are consistent with scattering by an extended medium having a\nKolmogorov fluctuation spectrum which is concentrated towards the pulsar. This\ninterpretation is also consistent with recent observations of multiple diffuse\nscintillation arcs for this pulsar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jun 2007 11:20:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2007 13:05:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Feb 2008 14:10:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We outline the possible strategy of the QW potential\nshape reconstruction, if the spectrum of QW is given in advance. The proposed\napproach is based on the combination of different techniques such as Inverse\nScattering Problem Method, Darboux and Liouville transformation.
