The intrinsic (comoving)\nsynchrotron peak frequency was then calculated by using the estimated Doppler\nfactor. Assuming a Lorentz factor of 5, the viewing angle of jets was\nconstrained. The high-resolution VLBI images of seven sources all show a\ncore-jet structure.

It has been proposed by Bodenheimer, Lin & Mardling that\nundetected companions acting to excite the orbital eccentricity are responsible\nfor these oversized planets, as they find new equilibrium radii in response to\nbeing tidally heated. In the case of HD 209458, this hypothesis has been\nrejected by some authors because there is no sign of such a companion at the 5\nm/s level, and because it is difficult to say conclusively that the\neccentricity is non-zero. Transit timing analysis [...]. Whether or not a\ncompanion is responsible for the large radius of HD 209458b, almost certainly\nsome short-period systems have companions which force their eccentricities to\nnonzero values. This paper is dedicated to quantifying this effect.\n  The eccentricity of a short-period planet will only be excited as long as its\n(non-resonant) companion's eccentricity is non-zero.

We\ndetermine which configurations are capable of sustaining significant\neccentricity for at least the age of the system, and show that these include\nsystems with companion masses as low as a fraction of an Earth mass. The\norbital parameters of such companions are consistent with recent calculations\nwhich show that the migration process can induce the formation of low mass\nplanets external to the orbits of hot Jupiters.

For this reason there is a growing interest in describing\ncontrol systems through symbolic models that are abstract descriptions of the\ncontinuous dynamics, where each \"symbol\" corresponds to an \"aggregate\" of\nstates in the continuous model. Since these symbolic models are of the same\nnature of the models used in computer science to describe software and\nhardware, they provide a unified language to study problems of control in which\nsoftware and hardware interact with the physical world. Furthermore the use of\nsymbolic models enables one to leverage techniques from supervisory control and\nalgorithms from game theory for controller synthesis purposes. In this paper we\nshow that every incrementally globally asymptotically stable nonlinear control\nsystem is approximately equivalent (bisimilar) to a symbolic model. The\napproximation error is a design parameter in the construction of the symbolic\nmodel and can be rendered as small as desired. Furthermore if the state space\nof the control system is bounded the obtained symbolic model is finite.

For the case of QD\ninteraction with arbitrary quantum light state in the linear regime, it has\nbeen shown that the local field induce a fine structure of the absorbtion\nspectrum. Instead of a single line with frequency corresponding to which the\nexciton transition frequency, a duplet is appeared with one component shifted\nby the amount of the local field coupling parameter. It has been demonstrated\nthe strong light--mater coupling regime arises in the weak-field limit. A\nphysical interpretation of the predicted effects has been proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jun 2007 11:37:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-05-27"}

Thus in this work, we discuss\nhow to design a better embedder and detector (or decoder). I first give a\nsummary of the prospective applications of watermarking technology and major\nwatermarking schemes in the literature. My review on the literature closely\ncenters upon how the side information is exploited at both embedders and\ndetectors. In Chapter 3, I explore the optimum detector or decoder according to\na particular probability distribution of the host signals. We found that the\nperformance of both multiplicative and additive spread spectrum schemes depends\non the shape parameter of the host signals. For spread spectrum schemes, the\nperformance of the detector or the decoder is reduced by the host interference.\nThus I present a new host-interference rejection technique for the\nmultiplicative spread spectrum schemes. Its embedding rule is tailored to the\noptimum detection or decoding rule. Though the host interference rejection\nschemes enjoy a big performance gain over the traditional spread spectrum\nschemes, their drawbacks that it is difficult for them to be implemented with\nthe perceptual analysis to achieve the maximum allowable embedding level\ndiscourage their use in real scenarios. Thus, in the last chapters of this\nwork, I introduce a double-sided technique to tackle this drawback. It differs\nfrom the host interference rejection schemes in that it utilizes but does not\nreject the host interference at its embedder. The perceptual analysis can be\neasily implemented in our scheme to achieve the maximum allowable level of\nembedding strength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jun 2007 05:37:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-13"}
