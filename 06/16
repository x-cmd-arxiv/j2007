Our simulations are applicable to the\ncollapse of supermassive stars (M > 10^3M_sun) and to very massive Pop III\nstars. We model our initial configurations by n=3 polytropes. The ratio of\nmagnetic to rotational kinetic energy in these configurations is chosen to be\nsmall (1% and 10%). We find that such magnetic fields do not affect the initial\ncollapse significantly. The core collapses to a black hole, after which black\nhole excision is employed to continue the evolution long enough for the hole to\nreach a quasi-stationary state. We find that the black hole mass is M_h = 0.95M\nand its spin parameter is J_h/M_h^2 = 0.7, with the remaining matter forming a\ntorus around the black hole. We freeze the spacetime metric (\"Cowling\napproximation\") and continue to follow the evolution of the torus after the\nblack hole has relaxed to quasi-stationary equilibrium. In the absence of\nmagnetic fields, the torus settles down following ejection of a small amount of\nmatter due to shock heating. When magnetic fields are present, the field lines\ngradually collimate along the hole's rotation axis. MHD shocks and the MRI\ngenerate MHD turbulence in the torus and stochastic accretion onto the central\nblack hole. When the magnetic field is strong, a wind is generated in the\ntorus, and the torus undergoes radial oscillations that drive episodic\naccretion onto the hole.

The lack of molecular gas is due to the enhanced UV radiation field\nin the starburst environment, consistent with the expectations for GRB\nprogenitors. In addition, the known presence of dense neutral gas clouds at\nr<500 pc from NGC1705-1 provides a natural reservoir of C^+, Si^+, and Fe^+\nions that may be subsequently excited by the afterglow UV radiation field to\nproduce excited lines commonly seen in GRB host ISM.

Because diverse\nconnectivity patterns tend to result in distinct network dynamics, and also\nbecause they provide the means to identify and classify several types of\ncomplex networks, it becomes important to obtain meaningful measurements of the\nlocal network topology. In addition to traditional features such as the node\ndegree, clustering coefficient and shortest path, motifs have been introduced\nin the literature in order to provide complementary description of the networks\nconnectivity. The current work proposes a new type of motifs, namely chains of\nnodes, namely sequences of connected nodes with degree two.

For example, in\nkination-dominated quintessence models of dark energy, the dark matter relic\nabundance can be significantly enhanced compared to that obtained from freeze\nout in a radiation-dominated universe. Collider measurements then will\nsimultaneously probe both dark matter and dark energy. In this article, we\ninvestigate the precision to which the LHC and ILC can determine the dark\nmatter and dark energy parameters under those circumstances. We use an\nillustrative set of four benchmark points in minimal supergravity in analogy\nwith the four LCC benchmark points. The precision achievable together at the\nLHC and ILC is sufficient to discover kination-dominated quintessence, under\nthe assumption that the WIMPs are the only dark matter component. The LHC and\nILC can thus play important roles as alternative probes of both dark matter and\ndark energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jun 2007 21:05:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2007 21:42:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-09"}

In microcavities, where bright excitons and photons form\npolaritons, they force the condensate to be linearly polarized--as observed. In\nbulk, they also force linear polarization, but of dark states, due to interband\nCoulomb scatterings. To evidence this dark condensate, we thus need indirect\nprocesses, like the shift it induces on the (bright) exciton line.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jun 2007 14:48:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-23"}

By this, we mean a morphism U_l from\nthe pointed derivator associated with the Morita homotopy theory of dg\ncategories to a triangulated strong derivator M^loc such that U_l commutes with\nfiltered homotopy colimits, preserves the point, sends each exact sequence of\ndg categories to a triangle and is universal for these properties. Similary, we\nconstruct the `the universal additive invariant of dg categories', i.e. the\nuniversal morphism of derivators U_a to a strong triangulated derivator M^add\nwhich satisfies the first two properties but the third one only for split exact\nsequences. We prove that Waldhausen K-theory appears as a mapping space in the\ntarget of the universal additive invariant. This is the first conceptual\ncharacterization of Quillen-Waldhausen's K-theory since its definition in the\nearly 70's. As an application we obtain for free the higher Chern characters\nfrom K-theory to cyclic homology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jun 2007 14:51:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Jun 2007 10:29:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 18 Sep 2008 17:55:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-18"}
