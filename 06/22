However, a low mass white dwarf could also result from a\nsingle star that experiences severe mass loss on the first ascent giant branch.\nA large population of low mass He-core white dwarfs has been discovered in the\nold metal-rich cluster NGC 6791. There is therefore a mechanism in clusters to\nproduce low mass white dwarfs without requiring binary star interactions, and\nwe search for evidence of a similar population in field white dwarfs. We argue\nthat there is a significant field population (of order half of the detected\nsystems) that arises from old metal rich stars which truncate their evolution\nprior to the helium flash from severe mass loss. There is a consistent absence\nof evidence for nearby companions in a large fraction of low mass white dwarfs.\nThe number of old metal-rich field dwarfs is also comparable with the\napparently single low mass white dwarf population, and our revised estimate for\nthe space density of low mass white dwarfs produced from binary interactions is\nalso compatible with theoretical expectations. This indicates that this channel\nof stellar evolution, hitherto thought hypothetical only, has been in operation\nin our own Galaxy for many billions of years. One strong implication of our\nmodel is that single low mass white dwarfs should be good targets for planet\nsearches because they are likely to arise from metal-rich progenitors.

It is a top-down approach using time\ndiscrete dynamical systems. One of its key steps includes the choice of a term\norder. The aim of this paper is to identify minimal requirements on data sets\nto be used with this algorithm and to characterize optimal data sets. We found\nminimal requirements on a data set based on how many terms the functions to be\nreverse engineered display. Furthermore, we identified optimal data sets, which\nwe characterized using a geometric property called \"general position\".\nMoreover, we developed a constructive method to generate optimal data sets,\nprovided a codimensional condition is fulfilled. In addition, we present a\ngeneralization of their algorithm that does not depend on the choice of a term\norder. For this method we derived a formula for the probability of finding the\ncorrect model, provided the data set used is optimal. We analyzed the\nasymptotic behavior of the probability formula for a growing number of\nvariables n (i.e. interacting chemicals). Unfortunately, this formula converges\nto zero as fast as r^(q^n), where q is a natural number and 0<r<1. Therefore,\neven if an optimal data set is used and the restrictions in using term orders\nare overcome, the reverse engineering problem remains unfeasible, unless\nprodigious amounts of data are available. Such large data sets are\nexperimentally impossible to generate with today's technologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2007 22:52:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-18"}

Methods:Deep near-infrared\nK-band data complete enough to sample the substellar population in IC348 and\nOTC are obtained from the literature. The spatial distribution of the K-band\npoint sources is analysed using the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) method. The Q\nparameter and the spanning trees are evaluated for stellar and substellar\nobjects as a function of cluster core radius R$_c$. Results: The stellar\npopulation in both IC348 and OTC display a clustered distribution whereas the\nsubstellar population is distributed homogeneously in space within twice the\ncluster core radius. Although the substellar objects do not appear to be bound\nby the cluster potential well, they are still within the limits of the cluster\nand not significantly displaced from their birth sites. Conclusions: The\nspatially homogeneous distribution of substellar objects is best explained by\nassuming higher initial velocities, distributed in a random manner and going\nthrough multiple interactions. The overall spatial coincidence of these objects\nwith the cluster locations can be understood if these objects are nevertheless\ntravelling slowly enough so as to feel the gravitational effect of the cluster.\nThe observations support the formation of substellar objects as ``ejected\nstellar embryos''.

A Bogoliubov-de Gennes\nanalysis reveals that families of these states contain intervals of a weak\noscillatory instability, except for the domain walls, which are always stable.\nThe development of the instabilities is examined by means of direct numerical\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jun 2007 15:46:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-10"}
