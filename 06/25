A horizon is a surface of possible light beams in a\nregion of space of finite distance from the observer, which means that since\nnothing travels faster than light, events on the far side of a horizon cannot\ninfluence those on the causal side. A black hole has such a horizon, where some\nradially outgoing light beams can never reach a distant (or even nearby)\nobserver. However, since one suspects that black holes can swallow energy, and\neven evaporate by Hawking radiation, such horizons must take on a time\ndependency. A naive introduction of temporal dependency results in infinities\n(singularities) in energy densities, suggesting in such descriptions that an\nin-falling observer would encounter a hard surface at the horizon. However, if\ncoordinates representing space-time as analogous to a \"flowing river\" are used\nto describe the dynamics of a black hole, no such singularities are\nencountered. Such a parameterization of time dependent horizons will be offered\nin this presentation.

We study the surface density\nand the velocities of satellites around isolated galaxies in the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey. We find that the surface number-density of satellites declines with\nthe projected distance as a power law with the slope -1.5-2. The rms velocities\ngradually decline: observations exclude constant velocities at a 10 sigma\nlevel. We show that observational data strongly favor the standard model: all\nthree major statistics of satellites - the number-density profile, the\nline-of-sight velocity dispersion, and the distribution function of the\nvelocities -- agree remarkably well with the predictions of the standard\ncosmological model. Thus, that the success of the standard model extends to\nscales (50-500) kpc, much lower than what was previously considered. MOND fails\non these scales for models which assume any single power-law number-density\nprofile of satellites and any constant velocity anisotropy by predicting nearly\nconstant rms velocities of satellites. Satellite data can be fit by fine-tuned\nmodels, which require (1) specific non-power-law density profile, (2) very\nradial orbits at large distances (velocity anisotropy beta =0.6-0.7 at 200-300\nkpc), and (3) 2-2.5 times more stellar mass than what is found in the galaxies.\nThe external gravity force - a necessary component for MOND -- makes the\nsituation even worse.

To better characterize these differences, we observed a\nsample of 43 massive Infrared Dark Clouds, originally selected as candidate\nhigh-mass starless cores, with the IRAM 30m telescope covering spectral line\ntracers of low-density gas, high-density gas, molecular outflows/jets and\ntemperature effects. The SiO(2-1) observations reveal detections toward 18\nsources. Assuming that SiO is exclusively produced by sputtering from dust\ngrains, this implies that at least in 40% of this sample star formation is\non-going. A broad range of SiO line-widths is observed (between 2.2 and\n65km/s), and we discuss potential origins for this velocity spread. While the\nlow-density tracers 12CO(2-1) and 13CO(1-0) are detected in several velocity\ncomponents, the high-density tracer H13CO+(1--0) generally shows only a single\nvelocity component and is hence well suited for kinematic distance estimates of\nIRDCs. Furthermore, the H13CO+ line-width is on average 1.5 times larger than\nthat of previously observed NH3(1,1). This is indicative of more motion at the\ndenser core centers, either due to turbulence or beginning star formation\nactivity. In addition, we detect CH3CN toward only six sources whereas CH3OH is\nobserved toward approximately 40% of the sample. Estimates of the CH3CN and\nCH3OH abundances are low with average values of 1.2x10^{-10} and 4.3x10^{-10},\nrespectively. These results are consistent with chemical models at the earliest\nevolutionary stages of high-mass star formation. Furthermore, the CH3OH\nabundances compare well to recently reported values for low-mass starless\ncores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2007 08:25:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-19"}

In order to introduce long-range interactions we also study\na network in which one of the scalars forms global strings. We observe that in\nthe absence of long-range interactions the formation of bound states has a\nsignificant influence on the evolution of the network. When long-range\ninteractions are turned on the bound states are short-lived and have a minimal\neffect on the network evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2007 15:01:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2007 10:24:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2007 15:05:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Here we study the long-time\nbehavior of long-lived, out-of-equilibrium, quasi-stationary dynamical states,\nwhose lifetime diverges in the thermodynamic limit. The nature of these states\nhas been the object of a lively debate, in the recent past. We introduce a new\nnumerical tool, based on the fluctuations of the phase of the instantaneous\nmagnetization of the system. Using this tool, we study the quasi-stationary\nstates that arise when the system is started from different classes of initial\nconditions, showing that the new observable can be exploited to compute the\nlifetime of these states. We also show that quasi-stationary states are present\nnot only below, but also above the critical temperature of the second order\nmagnetic phase transition of the model. We find that at supercritical\ntemperatures the lifetime is much larger than at subcritical temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2007 15:13:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Our study has yielded two interesting results. Firstly, in all cases,\nthe SZ temperature is hotter than the X-ray temperature and is within ten per\ncent of the virial temperature of the cluster. Secondly, the mean SZ\ntemperature is less affected by cooling and feedback than the X-ray\ntemperature. Both these results can be explained by the SZ temperature being\nless sensitive to the distribution of cool gas associated with cluster\nsubstructure. A comparison of the SZ and X-ray temperatures (measured for a\nsample of hot clusters) would therefore yield interesting constraints on the\nthermodynamic structure of the intracluster gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2007 15:58:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Mar 2008 09:26:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
