Predictions for a cluster population without dissolution limited by a\nV-band detection result in a power-law dN/dt distribution with an index of\n~-0.7. This is because the limiting cluster mass increases with age, due to\nevolutionary fading of clusters, reducing the number of observed clusters at\nold ages. When a mass cut well above the limiting cluster mass is applied, the\ndN/dt distribution is flat up to 1 Gyr. We conclude that cluster dissolution is\nof small importance in shaping the dN/dt distribution and incompleteness causes\ndN/dt to decline. The reason that no (mass independent) infant mortality of\nstar clusters in the first ~10-20 Myr is found is explained by a detection bias\ntowards clusters without nebular emission, i.e. cluster that have survived the\ninfant mortality phase. The reason we find no evidence for tidal (mass\ndependent) cluster dissolution in the first Gyr is explained by the weak tidal\nfield of the SMC. Our results are in sharp contrast to the interpretation of\nChandar et al. (2006), who interpret the declining dN/dt distribution as rapid\ncluster dissolution.

The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627. The high surface number density\nand luminosities of these HII regions (up to 10^40 ergs/s) dwarf the previously\nknown examples of isolated HII regions in clusters. We suggest that star\nformation may proceed in the stripped ISM, in both the galactic halo and\nintracluster space. The total mass of formed stars in the stripped ISM of ESO\n137-001 may approach several times 10^7 solar masses. Therefore, stripping of\nthe ISM not only contributes to the ICM, but also adds to the intracluster\nstellar light through subsequent star formation.

In most\nregions of these disks, gas attains sub-Keplerian speeds as a consequence of a\nnegative pressure gradient. Hydrodynamic drag leads to orbital decay and\ndepletion of the solid material in the disk, with characteristic timescales as\nshort as only a few hundred years for meter-sized objects at 1 AU. In this\npaper, we suggest a particle retention mechanism which promotes the\naccumulation of grains and the formation of planetesimals near the water\nsublimation front or ``snow line.'' This model is based on the assumption that,\nin the regions most interesting for planet formation, the viscous evolution of\nthe disk is due to turbulence driven by the magneto-rotational instability\n(MRI) in the surface layers of the disk. The depth to which MRI effectively\ngenerates turbulence is a strong function of the grain size and abundance. A\nsharp increase in the grain-to-gas density ratio across the snow line reduces\nthe column depth of the active layer. As the disk evolves towards a\nquasi-steady-state, this change in the active layer creates a local maximum in\nradial distribution of the gas surface density and pressure, causing the gas to\nrotate at super-Keplerian speed and halting the inward migration of grains.\nThis senario presents a robust process for grain retention which may aid in the\nformation of proto-gas-giant cores preferentially near the snow line.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2007 22:54:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The simplified, fluctuating point-conductance model of synaptic\nactivity provides the starting point of a variety of methods for the analysis\nof intracellular Vm recordings. In this model, the synaptic excitatory and\ninhibitory conductances are described by Gaussian-distributed stochastic\nvariables, or colored conductance noise. The matching of experimentally\nrecorded Vm distributions to an invertible theoretical expression derived from\nthe model allows the extraction of parameters characterizing the synaptic\nconductance distributions. This analysis can be complemented by the matching of\nexperimental Vm power spectral densities (PSDs) to a theoretical template, even\nthough the unexpected scaling properties of experimental PSDs limit the\nprecision of this latter approach. Building on this stochastic characterization\nof synaptic activity, we also propose methods to qualitatively and\nquantitatively evaluate spike-triggered averages of synaptic time-courses\npreceding spikes.

The learning performance, analyzed in terms of the generalization\ncapability, of the proposed method is also shown to be superior to that of the\nconventional method. With the addition of a gating network, the proposed method\nis successfully applied to the learning of sensory-motor flows for a small\nhumanoid robot as a realistic problem of time series prediction and generation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jun 2007 15:47:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2008 04:05:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-17"}

As systems continue to increase in\ntransmission rate, security concerns associated with detector dead times can\nlimit the production rate of sifted bits. We present a model of high-speed QKD\nin this limit that identifies an optimum transmission rate for a system with\ngiven link loss and detector response characteristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2007 22:08:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
