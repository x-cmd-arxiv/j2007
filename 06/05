To this end, we present an analysis of star-forming groups in the\nlocal group spiral galaxy M33, based on a new implementation of the Minimum\nSpanning Tree (MST) method. Unlike previous studies which limited themselves to\na single spatial scale, we study star-forming structures from the effective\nresolution limit (~20pc) to kpc scales. We find evidence for a continuum of\nstar-forming group sizes, from pc to kpc scales. We do not find a\ncharacteristic scale for OB associations, unlike that found in previous\nstudies, and we suggest that the appearance of such a scale was caused by\nspatial resolution and selection effects. The luminosity function of the groups\nis found to be well represented by a power-law with an index, -2, similar to\nthat found for clusters and GMCs. Additionally, the groups follow a similar\nmass-radius relation as GMCs. The size distribution of the groups is best\ndescribed by a log-normal distribution and we show that within a hierarchical\ndistribution, if a scale is selected to find structure, the resulting size\ndistribution will have a log-normal distribution. We find an abrupt drop of the\nnumber of groups outside a galactic radius of ~4kpc, suggesting a change in the\nstructure of the star-forming ISM, possibly reflected in the lack of GMCs\nbeyond this radius.

The detection of the 14.32um [NeV] line in just under half\nthe sample however implies that an AGN contributes significantly to the mid-IR\nflux in ~42% of ULIRGs. The emission line ratios, luminosities and PAH EWs are\nconsistent with the starbursts and AGN in ULIRGs being more extincted, and for\nthe starbursts more compact, versions of those in lower luminosity systems. The\nexcitations and electron densities in the NLRs of ULIRGs appear comparable to\nthose of lower luminosity starbursts, though there is evidence that the NLR gas\nin ULIRGs is more dense. We show that the combined luminosity of the 12.81um\n[NeII] and 15.56um [NeIII] lines correlates with both IR luminosity and the\nluminosity of the 6.2 micron and 11.2 micron PAH features in ULIRGs, and use\nthis to derive a calibration between PAH luminosity and star formation rate.\nFinally, we show that ULIRGs with 0.8 < S_sil < 2.4 are likely to be powered\nmainly by star formation, but that ULIRGs with S_sil < 0.8, and possibly those\nwith S_sil > 2.4, contain an IR-luminous AGN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2007 20:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

We obtain the equimolar mixtures used as\nsubstrates by applying the isomorphism between an alloy and the Ising model\n(conserved order parameter). The annealing temperature $T$ of the mixture then\nis a continuous parameter that characterizes the different sets of substrates,\nshaping the deposition process. As the alloy undergoes an order-disorder phase\ntransition at the Onsager critical temperature ($T_{c}$), the jamming and\npercolating properties of the dimers deposited over the substrate are subjected\nto non-trivial changes. These are reflected in a density-temperature phase\ndiagram with three well-defined regions. We find that for $T < T^* = 1.22\nT_{c}$ the occurrence of jamming prevents the onset of percolating clusters,\nwhile percolation is possible for $T > T^{*}$. Particular attention is focused\nclose to $T^{*}$, where the interplay between jamming and percolation restricts\nfluctuations, forcing exponents seemingly different from the standard\npercolation universality class. By analogy with a thermal transition, we study\nthe onset of percolation by using the {\\it temperature} (in this case, the\nsubstrate annealing temperature) as a control parameter. By proposing thermal\nscaling Ansatzes we analyze the behavior of the percolation threshold and its\nthermally induced fluctuations.

Affine structures on a ringed\nspace, arising mainly from complex analytical spaces of algebraic schemes over\nnumber fields, behave like differential structures on a smooth manifold.\n  As one does for differential manifolds, we will use pseudogroups of affine\ntransformations to define affine atlases on a ringed space. An atlas on a space\nis said to be an affine structure if it is maximal. An affine structure is\nadmissible if there is a sheaf on the underlying space such that they are\ncoincide on all affine charts, which are in deed affine open sets of a scheme.\nIn a rigour manner, a scheme is defined to be a ringed space with a specified\naffine structure if the affine structures are in action in some special cases\nsuch as analytical spaces of algebraic schemes. Particularly, by the whole of\naffine structures on a space, we will obtain respectively necessary and\nsufficient conditions that two spaces are homeomorphic and that two schemes are\nisomorphic, which are the two main theorems of the paper. It follows that the\nwhole of affine structures on a space and a scheme, as local data, encode and\nreflect the global properties of the space and the scheme, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2007 05:29:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Apr 2008 17:14:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2010 09:46:59 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2010 00:20:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-15"}

Rotation leads to\nthe build-up of massive disk-like structures which fragment to form protostars.\nAt metallicities Z ~ 10^-5 Zsun, dust cooling becomes effective and leads to a\nsudden drop of temperature at densities above n = 10^12 cm^-3. This induces\nvigorous fragmentation, leading to a very densely-packed cluster of low-mass\nstars. This is the first stellar cluster. The mass function of stars peaks\nbelow 1 Msun, similar to what is found in the solar neighborhood, and\ncomparable to the masses of the very-low metallicity subgiant stars recently\ndiscovered in the halo of our Milky Way. We find that even purely primordial\ngas can fragment at densities 10^14 cm^-3 < n < 10^16 cm^-3, although the\nresulting mass function contains only a few objects (at least a factor of ten\nless than the Z = 10^-5 Zsun mass function), and is biased towards higher\nmasses. A similar result is found for gas with Z = 10^-6 Zsun. Gas with Z <=\n10^-6 Zsun behaves roughly isothermally at these densities (with polytropic\nexponent gamma ~ 1.06) and the massive disk-like structures that form due to\nangular momentum conservation will be marginally unstable.

For this constraint to be as tight as\npossible, it is necessary to maximize the correlation between the two dipoles.\nThis can be achieved by optimizing the survey window through which the flux\ndipole is measured. Here we explicitly construct such a window for the 2MASS\nsurvey. The optimization in essence reduces to excluding from the calculation\nof the flux dipole galaxies brighter than some limiting magnitude K_min of the\nnear-infrared K_s band. This exclusion mitigates nonlinear effects and shot\nnoise from small scales, which decorrelate the 2MASS dipole from the CMB\ndipole. Under the assumption of negligible shot noise we find that the optimal\nvalue of K_min is about five. Inclusion of shot noise shifts the optimal K_min\nto larger values. We present an analytical formula for shot noise for the 2MASS\nflux dipole, to be used in follow-up work with 2MASS data.\n  The misalignment angle between the two dipoles is a sensitive measure of\ntheir correlation: the higher the correlation, the smaller the expectation\nvalue of the angle. A minimum of the misalignment is thus a sign of the optimal\ngravity window. We model analytically the distribution function for the\nmisalignment angle and show that the misalignment estimated by Maller et al. is\nconsistent with the assumed underlying model (though it is greater than the\nexpectation value).

Here we present an integrated experimental and\ntheoretical framework to understand and quantitatively predict how and when\ninformation spreads over social networks.

Since high variability of both\nthe intensity and frequency of human responses are found in many other\nactivities, our findings are pertinent to many other human driven diffusion\nprocesses like rumors, fads, innovations or news which has important\nconsequences for organizations management, communications, marketing or\nelectronic social communities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2007 12:32:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-01"}

The phase-separation is modeled through a\nnon-autonomous Cahn-Hilliard equation whose spinodal is determined by the\nevolving guiding field. Control over the dynamics of the spinodal gives control\nover the velocity of the instability front which separates the stable and\nunstable regions of the system. Since the wavelength of the pattern is largely\ndetermined by this velocity, the distance between successive precipitation\nbands becomes controllable. We demonstrate the above ideas by numerical studies\nof a 1D system with diffusive guiding field.
