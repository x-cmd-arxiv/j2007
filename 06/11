The magneto-rotational instability (MRI)\nsupplies one means, but protoplanetary disk gas is typically too poorly ionized\nto be magnetically active. Here we show that the MRI can, in fact, explain\nobserved accretion rates for the sub-class of T Tauri disks known as\ntransitional systems. Transitional disks are swept clean of dust inside rim\nradii of ~10 AU. Stellar coronal X-rays ionize material in the disk rim,\nactivating the MRI there. Gas flows from the rim to the star, at a rate limited\nby the depth to which X-rays ionize the rim wall. The wider the rim, the larger\nthe surface area that the rim wall exposes to X-rays, and the greater the\naccretion rate. Interior to the rim, the MRI continues to transport gas; the\nMRI is sustained even at the disk midplane by super-keV X-rays that Compton\nscatter down from the disk surface. Accretion is therefore steady inside the\nrim. Blown out by radiation pressure, dust largely fails to accrete with gas.\nContrary to what is usually assumed, ambipolar diffusion, not Ohmic\ndissipation, limits how much gas is MRI-active. We infer values for the\ntransport parameter alpha on the order of 0.01 for GM Aur, TW Hyd, and DM Tau.\nBecause the MRI can only afflict a finite radial column of gas at the rim, disk\nproperties inside the rim are insensitive to those outside. Thus our picture\nprovides one robust setting for planet-disk interaction: a protoplanet interior\nto the rim will interact with gas whose density, temperature, and transport\nproperties are definite and decoupled from uncertain initial conditions. Our\nstudy also supplies half the answer to how disks dissipate: the inner disk\ndrains from the inside out by the MRI, while the outer disk photoevaporates by\nstellar ultraviolet radiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jun 2007 17:14:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The most common\nrelation, which considers the average roughness $<w_2>$ as scaling factor, is\nnot obeyed in the steady states of a group of ballistic-like models in 2+1\ndimensions, even when very large system sizes are considered. On the other\nhand, good collapse of the same data is obtained with a scaling relation that\ninvolves the root mean square fluctuation of the roughness, which can be\nexplained by finite-size effects on second moments of the scaling functions. We\nalso obtain data collapse with an alternative scaling relation that accounts\nfor the effect of the intrinsic width, which is a constant correction term\npreviously proposed for the scaling of $<w_2>$. This illustrates how\nfinite-size corrections can be obtained from roughness distributions scaling.\nHowever, we discard the usual interpretation that the intrinsic width is a\nconsequence of high surface steps by analyzing data of restricted\nsolid-on-solid models with various maximal height differences between\nneighboring columns. We also observe that large finite-size corrections in the\nroughness distributions are usually accompanied by huge corrections in height\ndistributions and average local slopes, as well as in estimates of scaling\nexponents. The molecular-beam epitaxy model of Das Sarma and Tamborenea in 1+1\ndimensions is a case example in which none of the proposed scaling relations\nworks properly, while the other measured quantities do not converge to the\nexpected asymptotic values.

For time intervals between spikes greater than the refractory\nperiod, the distribution of the intervals follows a Poisson distribution. The\nspiking pattern is highly periodic over time windows corresponding to the\noptical length of the external cavity, with a slow change of the spiking\npattern as time increases. When zero-lag synchronization between the two lasers\nis established, the statistics of the nearly perfectly matched spikes are not\naltered. The similarity of these features to those found in complex interacting\nneural networks, suggests the use of laser systems as simpler physical models\nfor neural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2007 11:01:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Unlike existing methods, we do not\nrequire the molecules before excitation to be in a pure state, allowing us to\ntreat the important case of initially thermally excited molecules. Even if only\na single initial level is appreciably populated, initial levels with small\npopulations can still give major contributions to the unknown vibrational\nstate, making it essential to take them into account. In addition to the\nexcitation pulse, the method uses two incident, short laser pulses in a\nnon-co-linear geometry to create four-wave mixing in the molecules. The\nmeasurements used in the reconstruction are spectra of the outgoing four-wave\nmixing pulse at different time delays of the excitation laser pulse. An\nimportant point is that the method does not require detailed knowledge of\nmolecular transition moments between excited states nor of any of the incoming\nlaser pulses, but circumvents this requirement by using one or more calibration\nlaser pulses in a separate experiment either before or after the main data are\nrecorded. The only requirements for the calibration laser pulses are that the\nconstant parts of their spectrums should together cover the spectral range of\nthe excitation laser pulse, and the constant part of each should have\nsufficient spectral overlap with one other calibration pulse to populate two of\nthe same levels.

Our main goal is to statistically characterize the flare-like variability\nof 165 low mass (0.1-0.3 M_sun) ONC members in order to test and constrain the\nphysical scenario in which flares explain all the observed emission. Methods.\nWe adopt a maximum likelihood piece-wise representation of the observed X-ray\nlight curves and detect flares by taking into account both the amplitude and\ntime derivative of the count-rate. We then derive the frequency and energy\ndistribution of the flares. Results. The high energy tail of the energy\ndistribution of flares is well described by a power-law with index 2.2. We test\nthe hypothesis that light curves are built entirely by overlapping flares with\na single power law energy distribution. We constrain the parameters of this\nsimple model for every single light curve. The analysis of synthetic light\ncurves obtained from the model indicates a good agreement with the observed\ndata. Comparing low mass stars with stars in the mass interval (0.9-1.2M_sun),\nwe establish that, at ~1 Myr, low mass and solar mass stars of similar X-ray\nluminosity have very similar flare frequencies. Conclusions. Our observational\nresults are consistent with the following model/scenario: the light curves are\nentirely built by over- lapping flares with a power-law intensity distribution;\nthe intense flares are individually detected, while the weak ones merge and\nform a pseudo-quiescent level, which we indicate as the characteristic level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2007 15:58:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We present a new\nprofile reconstruction method that is based on the analytic least-square\nsolution for the estimation of the shower profile from the observed light\nsignal and discuss the extrapolation of the profile with a Gaisser-Hillas\nfunction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2007 15:59:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-12"}
