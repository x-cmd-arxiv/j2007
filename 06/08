They become\nsmaller and smaller until crossing the Planck scale where conventional QFT is\nchallenged, so that unknown ultraviolet physics may be traced in the observable\ncosmological fluctuations. Usually this issue is addressed in the inflationary\ncontext, but trans-Planckian reasoning is much broader. We examine this logic\nin a simple example of scalar quantum field theory in the expanding and\ncontracting Milne universes, where wavelengths of the eigenmodes are red- or\nblue-shifted. Trans-Planckian modifications of QFT should result in a\nUV-dependent VeV of the energy momentum tensor of a scalar field in the Milne\nuniverse. On the other hand, the Milne universe is another coordinate systems\nof flat Minkowski space-time, and the covariant energy momentum tensor should\nbe the same (but vacuum-dependent) in different coordinates of flat space time.\nWe explicitly demonstrate that in conventional QFT the energy momentum tensor,\nchoosing the adiabatic vacuum, is identical to zero in Minkowski coordinates,\nand remains zero in the contracting Milne universe (due to non-trivial\ncancellations of contributions from particles which appear in the accelerating\nframe and from vacuum polarization there). In contrast to this, the\ntrans-Planckian modification of the energy momentum tensor is not motivated. We\nprovide a similar argument for the expanding Milne universe, where the energy\nmomentum tensor in the conformal vacuum is non-zero. Similar arguments are\napplicable for other cosmological models where the curvature is much lower than\nPlanckian which leads to conflicts with trans-Planckian considerations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2007 17:57:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-08"}

Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is\ncomplicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the\ndistribution -- the part of the distribution representing large but rare events\n-- and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior\nholds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as\nleast-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of\nparameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods\nreturn accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no\nindication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a\nprincipled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law\nbehavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting\nmethods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic\nand likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests\non synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also\napply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of\ndifferent disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law\ndistribution.

Such discussions have largely\nfocused on the 2D angular correlation. Here and in a companion paper (Paper II)\nwe explore how magnification bias distorts the 3D correlation function and\npower spectrum, as first considered by Matsubara. The interesting point is: the\ndistortion is anisotropic. Magnification bias preferentially enhances the\nobserved correlation in the line-of-sight (LOS) orientation, especially on\nlarge scales. For example at LOS separation of ~100 Mpc/h, where the intrinsic\ngalaxy-galaxy correlation is rather weak, the observed correlation can be\nenhanced by lensing by a factor of a few, even at a modest redshift of z ~\n0.35. The opportunity: this lensing anisotropy is distinctive, making it\npossible to separately measure the galaxy-galaxy, galaxy-magnification and\nmagnification-magnification correlations, without measuring galaxy shapes. The\nanisotropy is distinguishable from the well known distortion due to peculiar\nmotions, as will be discussed in Paper II. The challenge: the magnification\ndistortion of the galaxy correlation must be accounted for in interpreting data\nas precision improves. For instance, the ~100 Mpc/h baryon acoustic oscillation\nscale in the correlation function is shifted by up to ~3% in the LOS\norientation, and up to ~0.6% in the monopole, depending on the galaxy bias,\nredshift and number count slope. The corresponding shifts in the inferred\nHubble parameter and angular diameter distance, if ignored, could significantly\nbias measurements of the dark energy equation of state. Lastly, magnification\ndistortion offers a plausible explanation for the well known excess\ncorrelations seen in pencil beam surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2007 02:46:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Jun 2007 05:14:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

These\ndatasets provide a unique basis at z< 1 which can be directly compared with\nhigh redshift samples built with similar selection criteria. We discuss the\ndependence of the correlation function parameters (r0, delta) on the\nultraviolet luminosity as well as the linear bias evolution. We find that the\nbias parameter shows a gradual decline from high (b > 2) to low redshift (b ~\n0.79^{+0.1}_{-0.08}). When accounting for the fraction of the star formation\nactivity enclosed in the different samples, our results suggest that the bulk\nof star formation migrated from high mass dark matter halos at z>2 (10^12 <\nM_min < 10^13 M_sun, located in high density regions), to less massive halos at\nlow redshift (M_min < 10^12 M_sun, located in low density regions). This result\nextends the ``downsizing'' picture (shift of the star formation activity from\nhigh stellar mass systems at high z to low stellar mass at low z) to the dark\nmatter distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2007 20:26:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

For parameters relevant to the\noligarchic stage of planet formation, dynamical friction keeps the typical\neccentricities small and prevents orbit crossing. Interactions at impact\nparameters greater than several Hill radii cause the protoplanets to repel each\nother; if the impact parameter is instead much less than the Hill radius, the\nprotoplanets shift slightly in semi-major axis but remain otherwise\nunperturbed. If the orbits of two or more protoplanets are separated by less\nthan a Hill radius, they are each pushed towards an equilibrium spacing between\ntheir neighbors and can exist as a stable co-orbital system. In the\nshear-dominated oligarchic phase of planet formation we show that the feeding\nzones contain several oligarchs instead of only one. Growth of the protoplanets\nin the oligarchic phase drives the disk to an equilibrium configuration that\ndepends on the mass ratio of protoplanets to planetesimals, $\\Sigma/\\sigma$.\nEarly in the oligarchic phase, when $\\Sigma/\\sigma$ is low, the spacing between\nrows of co-orbital oligarchs are about 5 Hill radii wide, rather than the 10\nHill radii cited in the literature. It is likely that at the end of oligarchy\nthe average number of co-orbital oligarchs is greater than unity. In the outer\nsolar system this raises the disk mass required to form the ice giants. In the\ninner solar system this lowers the mass of the final oligarchs and requires\nmore giant impacts than previously estimated. This result provides additional\nevidence that Mars is not an untouched leftover from the oligarchic phase, but\nmust be composed of several oligarchs assembled through giant impacts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2007 20:33:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2009 02:03:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Taking\ninto account that the momenta flowing along the three legs of the diagram are\nconstrained by momentum conservation, the number of overall l.i. functions that\nenter the most general solution must reduce accordingly.\n  To determine the exact structure and content of the analytic solution for the\nthree-point function, I use the analogy that exists between Feynman diagrams\nand electric circuit networks, in which the electric current flowing in the\nnetwork plays the role of the momentum flowing in the lines of a Feynman\ndiagram. This analogy is employed to define exactly which three out of the four\nhypergeometric functions are relevant to the analytic solution for the Feynman\ndiagram. The analogy is built based on the equivalence between electric\nresistance circuit networks of type \"Y\" and \"Delta\" in which flows a conserved\ncurrent. The equivalence is established via the theorem of minimum energy\ndissipation within circuits having these structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2007 20:49:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2007 02:52:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 Aug 2008 12:43:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-12"}

We discuss the X-ray spectral properties of this source as\nwell as its variations with time. The 0.5-10 keV spectrum shows significant\ncomplexity beyond a simple power-law form, with clear evidence existing for a\n\"soft excess\" as well as absorption by highly ionized plasma (a warm absorber)\nwithin the central engine of this active galactic nucleus. We show that the\nsoft excess is best described as originating from thermal Comptonization by\nplasma that is appreciably cooler than the primary X-ray emitting plasma; we\nfind that the form of the soft excess cannot be reproduced adequately by\nreflection from an ionized accretion disk. The only measurable deviation from\nthe power-law continuum in the hard spectrum comes from the presence of cold\nand ionized fluorescent iron-K emission lines at 6.4 and 6.97 keV,\nrespectively. While constraints on the ionized iron line are weak, the cold\nline is found to be narrow at CCD-resolution with a flux that does not track\nthe temporal changes in the underlying continuum, implying an origin in the\nouter radii of the accretion disk or the putative molecular torus of Seyfert\nunification schemes. The X-ray continuum itself varies on all accessible time\nscales. We detect a ~230-second time-lag between soft and hard EPIC-pn bands\nthat, if interpreted as scattering timescales within a Comptonizing disk\ncorona, can be used to constrain the physical size of the primary X-ray source\nto a characteristic length scale of ~2 gravitational radii. Taken together, the\nsmall implied coronal size and the large implied iron line emitting region\nindicate a departure from the current picture of a \"typical\" AGN geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2007 20:57:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

Theoretical models of U and Th\nmigration have been proposed. These models suggest that the unique features of\nEarth are closely connected with its unique U and Th migration models and\ndistribution patterns. In the Earth, U and Th can combine with oxidative\nvolatile components and water, migrate up to the asthenosphere position to form\nan enrichment zone (EZ) of U and Th first, and then migrate up further to the\ncrusts through magmatism and metamorphism.

The heat-producing elements, currently\nmainly U and Th, in the EZ are also the energy sources that drive the formation\nand evolution of the crust of Earth and create special granitic continental\ncrusts.

This effect originates from the change of the\nshape of the vortex core due to non-equilibrium effects (similar to the\nmechanism of vortex motion instability in the Larkin-Ovchinnikov theory). The\nmoving vortex creates a deficit of quasiparticles in front of its motion and an\nexcess of quasiparticles behind the core of the moving vortex. This results in\nthe appearance of a wake (region with suppressed order parameter) behind the\nvortex which attracts other vortices resulting in an effective\ndirection-dependent interaction between vortices. When the vortex velocity $v$\nreaches the critical value $v_c$ quasi-phase slip lines (lines with fast vortex\nmotion) appear which may coexist with slowly moving vortices between such\nlines. Our results are found within the framework of the time-dependent\nGinzburg-Landau equations and are strictly valid when the coherence length\n$\\xi(T)$ is larger or comparable with the decay length $L_{in}$ of the\nnon-equilibrium quasiparticle distribution function.

(2006) obtained. The situation appears to be non-scientific, as\nthe system of equations is a linear one. These are simple algebraic equations\nwhere the variables are to be eliminated. However, it is a matter of surprise\nthat by solving these equations, two scientific groups are getting polynomials\nof different degrees. In the present discussion, we have attempted to short out\nthis discrepancy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2007 07:40:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-11"}

Computer science research in evaluation faces an immense\nchallenge, having to cope with contributions from several conflicting and\ncontroversial research fields.

However,\nself-organizing principles have to be applied to deal with upcoming problems,\ne.g. information dissemination. These kinds of problems are not easy to tackle,\nrequiring complex algorithms. Moreover, the usefulness of pure ad-hoc networks\nis arguably limited. Hence, enthusiasm for mobile ad-hoc networks, which could\neliminate the need for any fixed infrastructure, has been damped. The goal is\nto overcome the limitations of pure ad-hoc networks by augmenting them with\ninstant Internet access, e.g. via integration of UMTS respectively GSM links.\nHowever, this raises multiple questions at the technical as well as the\norganizational level. Motivated by characteristics of small-world networks that\ndescribe an efficient network even without central or organized design, this\npaper proposes to combine mobile ad-hoc networks and infrastructured networks\nto form hybrid wireless networks.

The aim of this\npaper is to identify and characterise the physical and kinematic properties of\nthe external star forming regions in a sample of ULIRGs, including TDG\ncandidates, using optical IFS and high angular resolution HST imaging. We have\nfound that the presence of external star-forming regions is common with 12\nobjects being identified in 5 ULIRGs. These regions show a large range of\ndynamical mass up to 1x10^{10} M_sun, with average sizes of ~750 pc. In\naddition, the line ratios, metallicities and H\\alpha equivalent widths are\ntypical of young bursts of star formation (age ~ 5-8 Myr), and similar to those\nof other TDG candidates. Their extinction corrected H\\alpha luminosities lead\nto masses for the young stellar component of ~2x10^6 - 7x10^8 M_sun. The\nlikelihood of survival of these regions as TDGs is discussed based on their\nstructural and kinematic properties. Most of these systems follow the relation\nbetween effective radius and velocity dispersion found for globular clusters\nand Ellipticals, which suggests they are stable against internal motions. The\nstability against forces from the parent galaxy have been studied and a\ncomparison of the data with the predictions of dynamical evolutionary models is\nalso performed. Five regions out of twelve show High-Medium or High likelihood\nof survival.

The present paper is intended to fill this gap and we provide\ntwo-sided sharp estimates for the Green function for a half-space.
