The\nleading calculation is carried out for the alphas(mb) penguin contributions\nfrom charm quark, up quark, and magnetic penguin loops in the NDR and HV\nrenormalization schemes. Power suppressed penguins that are proportional to the\nchiral condensate are also computed using a new factorization formula for these\nterms, which is derived working to all orders in alphas(sqrt{mb\\Lambda}). We\ndemonstrate using SCET1 that this formula exhibits only small perturbative\nphases and does not have endpoint singularities. Due to our use of data to fix\nhadronic parameters we obtain significantly more accurate predictions for the\nshort-distance standard model penguin amplitudes than have been found in the\npast. Analyzing data in B-> pi pi, B->K pi, and B->rho rho for the penguin\namplitudes we find that standard model short-distance imaginary parts are an\norder of magnitude smaller than current measurements, while real parts are up\nto a factor of two smaller with the correct sign.

Rather, the dominant dissipation\nmechanism is collisional Landau levelexcitations followed by pair production\nvia the deexcitation gamma-rays ultimately leading to electrons with the energy\nbelow the Landau energy.

This extended corona is better suited than a thin\natmosphere to convert most of the primary beam energy to non-thermal radiation\nand, as we show, most of the coronal energy release is radiated away in the\nhard X-ray and the soft gamma-ray bands by Comptonization and bremsstrahlung.\nThe radiation spectrum is a power-law with the photon index $1<\\alpha<2$.

In the first one, the peak power to average\npower ratio (PPAPR) of the input constellation is held fixed, while in the\nsecond problem, the peak power is fixed independently of the average power.

The Hill stability boundary is defined analytically, but no\nequations exist to define the Lagrange boundary, so we perform numerical\nexperiments to estimate the location of this boundary. To explore the effect of\nresonances, we consider orbital element space near the conditions in the HD\n82943 and 55 Cnc systems. Previous studies have shown that, for non-resonant\nsystems, the two stability boundaries are nearly coincident.

The former type of outflow could be ejecta that is\nejected during the prompt phase of a GRB and consists of a series of baryonic\nshells with a distribution of Lorentz factors, and the latter type could be an\nelectron-positron-pair wind that is driven by the post-burst central engine.

Current models for the\nreionization of intergalactic hydrogen predict that overdense regions will be\nreionized early, thus delaying the build up of stellar mass in the progenitors\nof massive lower-redshift galaxies. As a result, the stellar populations\nobserved in intermediate redshift galaxies are somewhat younger and hence\nbrighter in overdense regions of the Universe. Galaxy surveys would therefore\nbe sensitive to galaxies with a somewhat lower dark matter mass in overdense\nregions. The corresponding increase in the observed number density of galaxies\ncan be parameterized as a galaxy bias due to reionization. We model this\nprocess using merger trees combined with a stellar synthesis code. Our model\ndemonstrates that reionization has a significant effect on the clustering\nproperties of galaxy samples that are selected based on their star-formation\nproperties. The bias correction in Lyman-break galaxies (including those in\nproposed baryonic oscillation surveys at z<1) is at the level of 10-20% for a\nhalo mass of 10^12 solar masses, leading to corrections factors of 1.5-2 in the\nhalo mass inferred from measurements of clustering length. The reionization of\nhelium could also lead to a sharp increase in the amplitude of the galaxy\ncorrelation function at z~3. We find that the reionization bias is\napproximately independent of scale and halo mass. However since the traditional\ngalaxy bias is mass dependent, the reionization bias becomes relatively more\nimportant for lower mass systems. The correction to the bias due to\nreionization is very small in surveys of luminous red galaxies at z<1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2007 01:57:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-19"}

This study extends the VO methods previously used to identify\nX-ray-selected obscured type-II AGN to investigate whether very luminous radio\nand X-ray emission originates from different phenomena in the same galaxy. The\nhigh-redshift starbursts have typical sizes of 5--10 kpc and star formation\nrates of ~1000 Msun/yr. There is no correlation between radio and X-ray\nluminosities nor spectral indices at z>~1.3. ~70% of both the radio-selected\nAGN and the starburst samples were detected by Chandra. The X-ray luminosity\nindicates the presence of an AGN in at least half of the 45 cross-matched radio\nstarbursts, of which 11 are type-II AGN including 7 at z>1.5.

It also predicts an inverted hierarchy for the\nneutrino masses. We point out several advantages and distinguishing tests of\nthe scaling hypothesis compared to the L_e - L_mu - L_tau flavor symmetry,\nwhich is usually assumed to provide an understanding of the inverted hierarchy.\nScenarios which have initially vanishing U_{e3} and maximal atmospheric\nneutrino mixing are shown to be unlikely to lead to non-maximal theta_{23}\nwhile keeping simultaneously U_{e3} zero.

The consequences of the scaling hypothesis\nfor high energy astrophysical neutrinos at neutrino telescopes are also\ninvestigated.

We present spatially\nresolved VLT/NACO images and low resolution spectra of SCR 1845 in the J, H and\nK near-infrared bands. Since the T dwarf companion, SCR 1845B, is so close to\nthe primary SCR 1845A, orbital motion is evident even within a year. Following\nthe orbital motion, the binary's mass can be measured accurately within a\ndecade, making SCR 1845B a key T-dwarf mass-luminosity calibrator. The NIR\nspectra allow for accurate determination of spectral type and also for rough\nestimates of the object's physical parameters. The spectral type of SCR 1845B\nis determined by direct comparison of the flux calibrated JHK spectra with T\ndwarf standard template spectra and also by NIR spectral indices obtained from\nsynthetic photometry. Constrained values for surface gravity, effective\ntemperature and metallicity are derived by comparison with model spectra.
