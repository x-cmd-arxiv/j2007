Of the 51 cores, 37 show broad\nlinewings indicative of molecular outflows. In 13 cases, the linewings could be\ndue to confusion with neighbouring flows but 9 of those sources also have\nnear-infrared detections confirming their protostellar nature. The total\nfraction of protostars in our sample is 65%. All but four outflow detections\nare confirmed as protostellar by Spitzer IR detections and only one Spitzer\nsource has no outflow, showing that outflow maps at this sensitivity are\nequally good at identifying protostars as Spitzer. Outflow momentum flux\ncorrelates both with source luminosity and with core mass but there is\nconsiderable scatter even within this one cloud despite the homogeneous\ndataset. We fail to confirm the result of Bontemps et al.

We find that outflow\npower may not show a simple decline between the Class 0 to Class I stages. Our\nsample includes low momentum flux, low-luminosity Class 0 sources, possibly at\na very early evolutionary stage.

As an example of this procedure, the\ntwo-loop beta functions of various relevant gauge theories are obtained (QED,\nSuperQED, Yang-Mills and N=1 SuperYM) without making use of the Ward\nidentities, which are mandatory in the standard differential renormalization\nprocedure. Also, we study how to deal with expressions that have IR and UV\ndivergences, showing that both are renormalized with independent scales. This\nresult allow us to give new insight on the origin of the higher order\ncorrections to the beta function of the N=1 SuperYM theory, as in this case we\nhave both divergences due to the form of the gauge propagator. This is an\nadvantage over usual dimensional regularization methods, where both divergences\nbecome mixed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2007 22:24:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2007 21:03:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-27"}

Maps with an average sensitivity of 50 microK per beam\nhave been obtained for each channel. At high Galactic latitude (|b|>30deg) the\n11 GHz data are found to contain the expected cosmic microwave background as\nwell as extragalactic radiosources, galactic synchrotron and free-free\nemission, and a dust-correlated component which is very likely of galactic\norigin. At the angular scales allowed by the window function of the experiment,\nthe dust-correlated component presents an amplitude \\Delta T aprox. 9-13 microK\nwhile the CMB signal is of order 27 microK. The spectral behaviour of the\ndust-correlated signal is examined in the light of previous COSMOSOMAS data at\n13-17 GHz and WMAP data at 22-94 GHz in the same sky region. We detect a\nflattening in the spectral index of this signal below 20 GHz which rules out\nsynchrotron radiation as being responsible for the emission. This anomalous\ndust emission can be described by a combination of free-free emission and\nspinning dust models with a flux density peaking around 20 GHz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2007 11:10:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Despite providing a good fit to the data,\ncurrent spectral models of the X-ray spectrum of AGN observed through an\naccretion disk wind are ad-hoc in their treatment of the properties of the wind\nmaterial. In order to address these limitations we adopt a numerical\ncomputation method that links a series of radiative transfer calculations,\nincorporating the effect of a global velocity field in a self-consistent manner\n(XSCORT). We present a series of example spectra from the XSCORT code that\nallow us to examine the shape of AGN X-ray spectra seen through a wind, for a\nrange of velocity and density distributions, total column densities and initial\nionization parameters. These detailed spectral models clearly show considerable\ncomplexity and structure that is strongly affected by all these factors. The\npresence of sharp features in the XSCORT spectra contrasts strongly with both\nthe previous models and with the smooth nature of the observed X-ray spectra of\nAGN with soft X-ray excesses, demonstrating that accretion disk winds are\nunlikely to be the origin of this mysterious spectral feature. The most\nsignificant parameter affecting the presence of the sharp features in the\nmodels is the terminal velocity of the wind. Increasing the terminal velocity\nof the absorbing material to ~c, and hence dramatically increasing the velocity\ndispersion across the wind, could potentially remove these features resulting\nin a spectrum similar to the previous models. Such a fast moving outflow cannot\nbe associated with a radiatively driven accretion disk wind, however the\npresence of a highly relativistic jet may provide an origin for such material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2007 12:28:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2007 14:43:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In any of these cases, we need to do approximations. We had explored\nbefore the possibilities of Laplace approximation and sampling by MCMC. In this\npaper, we explore the possibility of approximating this joint law by a\nseparable one in $\\fb$ and in $\\thetab$. This gives the possibility of\ndeveloping iterative algorithms with more reasonable computational cost, in\nparticular, if the approximating laws are choosed in the exponential conjugate\nfamilies. The main objective of this paper is to give details of different\nalgorithms we obtain with different choices of these families.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2007 14:36:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-14"}

The reinvestigation concerns\nthe possibility of a phase transition from the original Hermitian and $PT$\nsymmetric phase to a non-Hermitian and $PT$ symmetric one. This kind of phase\ntransition, if verified experimentally, will lead to the first proof that\nnon-Hermitian and $PT$ symmetric models are not just a mathematical research\nframework but are a nature desire. To do the investigation, we calculated the\neffective potential up to second order in the couplings and found a Hermitian\nto Non-Hermitian phase transition. This leads us to introduce, for the first\ntime, hermiticity as a symmetry which can be broken due to quantum corrections,\n\\textit{i.e.}, when starting with a model which is Hermitian in the classical\nlevel, quantum corrections can break hermiticity while the theory stays\nphysically acceptable. In fact, ignoring this phase will lead to violation of\nuniversality when comparing this model predictions with other models in the\nsame class of universality. For instance, in a previous work we obtained a\nsecond order phase transition for the $PT$ symmetric and non-Hermitian\n$(-g\\phi^{4})$ and according to universality, this phase should exist in the\nphase structure of the ($g\\phi^{4}+h\\phi^{6}$) model for negative $g$.

Within this\nformalism, we calculate luminosity distances and redshifts along the past light\ncone of an observer. The resulting luminosity distance-redshift relation is fit\nto that of a homogeneous model in order to deduce the best-fit cosmological\nconstant density Omega_Lambda. We find that the luminosity distance-redshift\nrelation is indeed modified, by a small fraction of order 10^{-5}.

For a sample of supernovae extending from z=0.02\nout to z=0.15, we find that Omega_Lambda=0.004. The value of Omega_Lambda has a\nlarge variance, and its magnitude tends to get larger for smaller redshifts,\nimplying that precision measurements from nearby supernova data will require\ntaking this effect into account. However, we find that this effect is likely\ntoo small to explain the observed value of Omega_Lambda=0.7. There have been\nprevious claims of much larger backreaction effects.

We are using the 8.665 GHz hyperfine transition of\n3-He+ to determine the 3-He/H abundance in Milky Way HII regions and planetary\nnebulae. This is one in a series of papers in which we discuss issues involved\nin deriving accurate 3-He/H abundance ratios from the available measurements.\nHere we describe the ionization correction we use to convert the 3-He+/H+\nabundance, y3+, to the 3-He/H abundance, y3. In principle the nebular\nionization structure can significantly influence the y3 derived for individual\nsources. We find that in general there is insufficient information available to\nmake a detailed ionization correction. Here we make a simple correction and\nassess its validity. The correction is based on radio recombination line\nmeasurements of H+ and 4-He+, together with simple core-halo source models. We\nuse these models to establish criteria that allow us to identify sources that\ncan be accurately corrected for ionization and those that cannot. We argue that\nthis effect cannot be very large for most of the sources in our observational\nsample. For a wide range of models of nebular ionization structure we find that\nthe ionization correction factor varies from 1 to 1.8. Although large\ncorrections are possible, there would have to be a conspiracy between the\ndensity and ionization structure for us to underestimate the ionization\ncorrection by a substantial amount.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2007 15:56:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}
