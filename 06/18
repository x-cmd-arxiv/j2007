If the BH mass is above\n10^{-5}M_{sun} the major contribution to the luminosity comes from the\nrelativistic gravitational reactor. In such a case a star evolves towards the\nEddington limit. This should lead to considerable expansion of a star and a\nglobal stability loss. Microscopic PBHs can exist in the interior of planetary\nbodies too. To produce the required excess of thermal energy on Jupiter and\nSaturn the masses of PBH captured are assumed to be reached of 4 10^{19} and 7\n10^{18} g, respectively. These microscopic objects are comparable to the\nhydrogen atom in size. One can envision even a planet with the PBH acting as\nthe self-sufficient source of heating. Such a planet does not need a sun to\nmaintain animal life on its surface. This may last eons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jun 2007 20:12:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

QCD-vacuum\nbehaves effectively like a \"paramagnetic system\" of a classical theory in the\nsense that virtual color charges (gluons) emerge in it as spin effect of a\nparamagnetic material when a magnetic field aligns their microscopic magnetic\ndipoles. Making a classical analogy with the paramagnetism of Landau's\ntheory,we are able to introduce a kind of Landau effective action without\ntemperature and phase transition for simply representing QCD-vacuum behavior at\nhigher energies as magnetization of a paramagnetic material in the presence of\na magnetic field H. This reasoning allows us to use Thompson's heuristic\napproach in order to extract an \"effective susceptibility\" ($\\chi>0$) of\nQCD-vacuum.

As part of\nour discussion about an optimal strategy for planet detection, we shed some new\nlight on whether concentrating on highly-magnified events is promising and\nplanets in the 'resonant' angular separation equal to the angular Einstein\nradius are revealed most easily. Given that sub-Neptune mass planets can be\nconsidered being common around the host stars probed by microlensing\n(preferentially M- and K-dwarfs), the higher number of events that can be\nmonitored with a network of 2m telescopes and the increased detection\nefficiency for planets below 5 M_earth arising from an optimized strategy gives\na common effort of current microlensing campaigns a fair chance to detect an\nEarth-mass planet (from the ground) ahead of the COROT or Kepler missions. The\ndetection limit of gravitational microlensing extends even below 0.1 M_earth,\nbut such planets are not very likely to be detected from current campaigns.\nHowever, these will be within the reach of high-cadence monitoring with a\nnetwork of wide-field telescopes or a space-based telescope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2007 10:14:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Recent water\nmaser observations suggest that the HC region is expanding and accretion onto\nthe star is halted. Aims. This study aims to confirm the expansion scenario\nproposed for the HC region on the basis of recent H2O maser observations.\nMethods. We carried out continuum VLA observations at 1.3cm and 7mm with the A\narray plus Pie Town configuration to map the HC region towards G24 A1. Results.\nThe emission of the HC region has been resolved and shows a ring shape\nstructure. The profiles of the emission obtained by taking slices at different\nangles passing through the barycenter of the HC region confirm the shell\nstructure of the emission. The ratio between the inner and the outer radius of\nthe shell, Ri/Ro, derived fitting the normalized brightness temperature profile\npassing through the peak of the 7mm emission, is 0.9, which indicates that the\nshell is thin. The deconvolved outer radius estimated from the fit is 590 AU.\nThese results imply that the HC region in G24 A1 cannot be described in terms\nof a classical, homogeneous HII region but is instead an ionized shell. This\ngives support to the model of an expanding wind-driven, ionized shell suggested\nby the kinematics and distribution of the H2O masers associated with the HC\nregion. According to this model, the HC region is expanding on very short times\nscales, 21-66 yr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2007 10:27:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

To shed light on this puzzle we first have to\ndetermine whether the spin-down derived magnetic field values for these radio\npulsars are indeed representative of the actual neutron star magnetic field or\nif they are polluted, e.g. by the effects of a torque from a fallback disk. To\ninvestigate this possibility, we have performed deep IR observations of one of\nthese high magnetic field radio pulsars (PSR J1119-6127) with the ESO VLT to\nsearch for IR emission which can be associated with a disk.

Infinite Markov chains which contain a finite attractor\nare decisive w.r.t. every set F. In particular, this holds for probabilistic\nlossy channel systems (PLCS). Furthermore, all globally coarse Markov chains\nare decisive. This class includes probabilistic vector addition systems (PVASS)\nand probabilistic noisy Turing machines (PNTM). We consider both safety and\nliveness problems for decisive Markov chains, i.e., the probabilities that a\ngiven set of states F is eventually reached or reached infinitely often,\nrespectively. 1. We express the qualitative problems in abstract terms for\ndecisive Markov chains, and show an almost complete picture of its decidability\nfor PLCS, PVASS and PNTM. 2. We also show that the path enumeration algorithm\nof Iyer and Narasimha terminates for decisive Markov chains and can thus be\nused to solve the approximate quantitative safety problem. A modified variant\nof this algorithm solves the approximate quantitative liveness problem. 3.\nFinally, we show that the exact probability of (repeatedly) reaching F cannot\nbe effectively expressed (in a uniform way) in Tarski-algebra for either PLCS,\nPVASS or (P)NTM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2007 11:50:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2007 20:21:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-01"}

Here, light deflection by\ngalaxy clusters in motion is considered. Even if gravitational lensing mass\nmeasurements of galaxy clusters are regarded as very reliable estimates, the\nkinematic effect should be considered. A typical peculiar motion with respect\nto the Hubble flow brings about a systematic error < 0.3%, independent of the\nmass of the cluster. On the other hand, the effect of the spin increases with\nthe total mass. For cluster masses ~ 10^{15}M_{sun}, the effect of the\ngravitomagnetic term is < 0.04% on strong lensing estimates and < 0.5% in the\nweak lensing analyses. The total kinematic effect on the mass estimate is then\n< 1%, which is negligible in current statistical studies. In the weak lensing\nregime, the rotation imprints a typical angular modulation in the tangential\nshear distortion.

Here, we study the newly discovered tidal tails of\nthe Galactic globular cluster NGC 5466. By means of numerical simulations, we\nreproduce the shape, direction and surface density of the tidal tails, as well\nas the structural and kinematical properties of the present-day NGC 5466.\nAlthough its tails are very extended in SDSS data (> 45 degrees), NGC 5466 is\nonly losing mass slowly at the present epoch and so can survive for probably a\nfurther Hubble time. The effects of tides at perigalacticon and disc crossing\nare the dominant causes of the slow dissolution of NGC 5466, accounting for\nabout 60 % of the mass loss over the course of its evolution. The morphology of\nthe tails provides a constraint on the proper motion -- the observationally\ndetermined proper motion has to be refined (within the stated error margins) to\nmatch the location of the tidal tails.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2007 15:54:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We outline a physical mechanism which can, in\nprinciple, be one factor to explain the observed PC/AC relations for the long\nand short period Cepheids in the Galaxy, LMC and SMC. Our explanation relies on\nthe hydrogen ionization front-photosphere interaction and the way this\ninteraction changes with pulsation period, pulsation phase and metallicity.\nSince the PC relation is connected with the period-luminosity (PL) relation, it\nis postulated that such a mechanism can also explain the observed properties of\nthe PL relation in these three galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2007 15:55:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-19"}
