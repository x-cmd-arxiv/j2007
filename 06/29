These data show\nthat SN 2005gj is the second clear case, after SN 2002ic, of a thermonuclear\nexplosion in a dense circumstellar environment. Both the presence of singly and\ndoubly ionized iron-peak elements (FeIII and weak SII, SiII) near maximum light\nas well as the spectral evolution show that SN 2002ic-like events are Type Ia\nexplosions. Independent evidence comes from the exponential decay in luminosity\nof SN 2005gj, pointing to an exponential density distribution of the ejecta.\nThe interaction of the supernova ejecta with the dense circumstellar medium is\nstronger than in SN 2002ic: (1) the supernova lines are weaker; (2) the Balmer\nemission lines are more luminous; and (3) the bolometric luminosity is higher\nclose to maximum light. The velocity evolution of the Halpha components suggest\nthat the CSM around SN 2005gj is clumpy and it has a flatter density\ndistribution compared with the steady wind solution, in agreement with SN\n2002ic.

We look in detail at the so-called participant\nmultipole moments, obtained by an averaging procedure where in each event the\nsystem is translated to its center of mass and aligned with the major principal\naxis of the ellipse of inertia.

The potential energy\nlandscape ensemble, which we describe in the current paper, regards the maximum\naccessible potential energy, rather than the temperature, as a control\nvariable. We show here that while this approach is thermodynamically equivalent\nto the canonical ensemble, it not only sidesteps the idea of barriers, it\nallows us to be quantitative about the connectivity of a landscape. We\nillustrate these ideas with calculations on a simple atomic liquid and on the\nKob-Andersen model of a glass-forming liquid, showing, in the process, that the\nlandscape of the Kob-Anderson model appears to have a connectivity transition\nat the landscape energy associated with its mode-coupling transition.

Here we present results of a global numerical simulation\nwhich fully incorporates the effects of the black hole spacetime as well as\nmagnetorotational turbulence that is the primary source of angular momentum\ntransport in the flow. This simulation shows dramatic differences from\ncomparable simulations of untilted disks. Accretion onto the hole occurs\npredominantly through two opposing plunging streams that start from high\nlatitudes with respect to both the black-hole and disk midplanes. This is due\nto the aspherical nature of the gravitational spacetime around the rotating\nblack hole. These plunging streams start from a larger radius than would be\nexpected for an untilted disk. In this regard the tilted black hole effectively\nacts like an untilted black hole of lesser spin. Throughout the duration of the\nsimulation, the main body of the disk remains tilted with respect to the\nsymmetry plane of the black hole; thus there is no indication of a\nBardeen-Petterson effect in the disk at large. The torque of the black hole\ninstead principally causes a global precession of the main disk body. In this\nsimulation the precession has a frequency of $3 (M_\\odot/M)$ Hz, a value\nconsistent with many observed low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations.\nHowever, this value is strongly dependent on the size of the disk, so this\nfrequency may be expected to vary over a large range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2007 19:15:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Earlier studies of NLR spectra generally\nfound good agreement between the observations and the model predictions for\nmost strong emission lines, such as [O III] $\\lambda$5007, [O II]\n$\\lambda$3727, [N II] $\\lambda$6583, [Ne III] $\\lambda$3869, and the H and He\nrecombination lines. Nevertheless, the strengths of lines from species with\nionization potentials greater than that of He$^{+}$(54.4 eV), e.g. N$^{+4}$ and\nNe$^{+4}$, were often under-predicted. Among the explanations suggested for\nthese discrepancies were (selectively) enhanced elemental abundances and\ncontributions from shock heated gas. Interestingly, the NLR lines have widths\nof several 100 km s$^{-1}$, well in excess of the thermal broadening. If this\nis due to micro-turbulence, and the turbulence dissipates within the\nemission-line gas, the gas can be heated in excess of that due to\nphotoionization. We show that the combined effects of turbulence and\ndissipative heating can strongly enhance N V $\\lambda$1240 (relative to He II\n$\\lambda$1640), while the heating alone can boost the strength of [Ne V]\n$\\lambda$3426. We suggest that this effect is present in the NLR, particularly\nwithin $\\sim$ 100 pc of the central engine. Finally, since micro-turbulence\nwould make clouds robust against instabilities generated during acceleration,\nit is not likely to be a coincidence that the radially outflowing emission-line\ngas is turbulent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2007 20:37:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The most\nsignificant result is the direct detection of a substantial population of PMS\nstars and their clustering properties with respect to the distribution of the\nhigher mass members of the association. Although LH 95 represents a rather\nmodest star forming region, our photometry, with a detection limit $V$ \\lsim 28\nmag, reveals in its vicinity more than 2,500 PMS stars with masses down to\n$\\sim 0.3$ M{\\solar}. Our observations offer, thus, a new perspective of a\ntypical LMC association: The stellar content of LH 95 is found to extend from\nbright OB stars to faint red PMS stars, suggesting a fully populated Initial\nMass Function (IMF) from the massive blue giants down to the sub-solar mass\nregime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jun 2007 09:12:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In this communication we examine the properties of a\nnovel equivalent network derived iteratively from this 2-terminal network by\nreplacing everywhere the elemental resistive part $R$ with the whole 2-terminal\nnetwork. This replacement suggests a recursion $Z_{n+1}(\\omega) =\nf(Z_n(\\omega))$, with the recursive function $f(z) = (i\\omega Lz/i\\omega L + z)\n+ (z/1+i\\omega Cz)$. The recursive map has two fixed points -- an unstable\nfixed point $Z_u^\\star = 0$, and a stable fixed point $Z_s^\\star = R$. Thus,\nresistances at the boundary terminating the infinitely iterated network can now\nbe made arbitrarily small without changing the input impedance $Z_\\infty (=\nR)$. This, therefore, leads to realizing in the limit $n\\to\\infty$ an\neffectively dissipative network comprising essentially non-dissipative reactive\nelements ($L$ and $C$) only. Hence the oxymoron -- resistance without\nresistors! This is best viewed as a classical anomaly akin to the one\nencountered in turbulence.

The X-ray pulse profile is generally seen to be\ndouble-peaked, although a single-peaked pulse was seen by RXTE during an\noutburst in 1996.We intended to investigate the cause of the broad orbital\nmodulation in XY Ari to better understand the accretion flow in this system and\nother intermediate polars.

The\nvarious X-ray observations show that the broad orbital modulation varies in\nphase and significance, then ultimately disappears entirely in the last few\nyears. In addition, the X-ray pulse profile shows variations in depth and\nshape, and in the recent RXTE observations displays no evidence for changes in\nhardness ratio. The observed changes indicates that both the pulse profile and\nthe orbital modulation are solely due to geometrical effects at the time of the\nRXTE observations, rather than phase-dependent variations in photoelectric\nabsorption as seen previously. We suggest that this is evidence for a\nprecessing, tilted accretion disc in this system.

We conclude that this\ncombined approach can contribute meaningfully to our emerging capability for\nfull-disk vector magnetography as pioneered by SOLIS today and will be carried\nout by ground-based and space-borne magnetographs in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jun 2007 15:33:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-02"}

Building on a recent work\nby H.Chen et al (2004), we account for fluctuations of a single -point\nprobability density in turbulence, by introducing a``two-level'' (${\\bf\nc,v}$)-phase-space, separating microscopic (${\\bf c'\\equiv c_{micro}= c-v}$)\nand hydrodynamic (${\\bf v'=v-V}$) modes. Unlike traditional kinetic theories,\nwith hydrodynamic approximations derived in terms of small deviations from\nthermodynamic equilibrium, the theory developed in this work, is based on a\nfar- from -equilibrium isotropic and homogeneous turbulence as an unperturbed\nstate. The expansion in dimensionless rate of strain leads to a new class of\nturbulent models, including the well-known ${\\cal K}-{\\cal E}$, Reynolds stress\nand all possible nonlinear models. The role of interaction of the fluxes in\nphysical space with the energy flux across the scales, not present in standard\nmodeling, is demonstrated on example of turbulent channel flow.
