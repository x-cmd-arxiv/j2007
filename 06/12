We measured subsonic or at most transonic levels\nof internal turbulence within the condensations, implying virial masses which\ngenerally agree within a factor of ~ 2 with the masses derived from the 1.2mm\ndust continuum. This supports the notion that most of the L1688 starless\ncondensations are gravitationally bound and prestellar in nature.

The banana-states' Fourier-resolved spectra are well fitted\nby a single blackbody component with $kT \\sim 2-3$ keV depending on the source\nposition in the color -- color diagram and the Fourier frequency, thus\nindicating that this spectral component is responsible for the source\nvariability on these timescales. This result is in approximate agreement with\nsimilar behavior exhibited by the Z sources, suggesting that, as in that case,\nthe boundary layer -- the likely source of the thermal component -- is\nsupported by radiation pressure. Furthermore, it is found that the iron line at\n$\\sim$6.6 keV, clearly present in the averaged spectra, not apparent within the\nlimitations of our measurements in the frequency-resolved spectra irrespective\nof the frequency range. This would indicate that this spectral component\nexhibits little variability on time scales comprising the interval\n$10^{-2}-10^2$ seconds. In the island state the single blackbody model proved\ninadequate, particularly notable in our lowest frequency band ($0.008-0.8$ Hz).\nAn absorbed powerlaw or an additive blackbody plus hard powerlaw model was\nrequired to obtain a satisfactory fit.

The flares were sometimes intense, had rapid rise and\ndecay phases, and occurred late relative to the ``prompt'' phase. Some\nremarkable flares are observed with fluence comparable to the prompt GRB\nfluence. Many GRBs have several flares, which are sometimes overlapping. Short,\nintense, repetitive, and late flaring can be most easily understood within the\ncontext of the standard fireball model with the internal engine that powers the\nprompt GRB emission in an active state at late times. However, other models for\nflares have been proposed. Flare origin can be investigated by comparing the\nflare spectra to that of the afterglow and the initial prompt emission.

The phase transitions\nof the system are generally split into an Ising transition and an XY\ntransition, but the sequence and the nature of the transitions depend on the\nratio between the anisotropic couplings. In the isotropic limit the XY\nvariables are expected to be disordered before the Ising variables when thermal\nor quantum fluctuations are turned on gradually. In the anisotropic limit with\nzero perpendicular hoppings, the finite temperature transition is a\nKosterlitz-Thouless transition driven by proliferation of hybrid half vortices,\nand the zero temperature quantum phase transition is split into a bond order\ntransition and a 3D XY transition, which can be driven by the condensation of\neither single vortices or half vortices. After the condensation of half\nvortices the resultant state is a Mott Insulator of paired bosons.

Hence, asynchronous release, rather than being a \"synaptic\nnoise\", can play an important role in network dynamics. Additionally, we found\nthat a fast timescale synaptic depression is responsible for oscillatory\nnetwork activation during reverberations, whereas the onset of a slow timescale\ndepression leads to the termination of reverberation.

Therefore, they can be used, at least in principle, to put\nconstraints on that interaction.

We use theoretical considerations supported by Monte Carlo simulations\nto derive statistical relations between the corresponding astrometric,\nphotometric, and radial-velocity effects. For most stellar types the\nastrometric jitter due to stellar surface structures is expected to be of order\n10 micro-AU or greater.

Using the well-known methods of non-equilibrium thermodynamics we\nidentify thermodynamic forces and their conjugated flows induced in networks as\na result of single node degree perturbation. The forces and the flows can be\nunderstood as a response of the system to events, such as random removal of\nnodes or intentional attacks on them. Finally, we show that cross effects (such\nas thermodiffusion, or thermoelectric phenomena), in which one force may not\nonly give rise to its own corresponding flow, but to many other flows, can be\nobserved also in complex networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2007 10:32:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The results are discussed in\nrelation to our earlier work on 3 younger clusters in these galaxies; NGC6611,\nN11 and NGC346 paying particular attention to the nitrogen abundances which are\nan important probe of the role of rotation in the evolution of stars. This work\nalong with that of the younger clusters provides a consistent dataset of\nabundances and atmospheric parameters for over 100 B-type stars in the three\ngalaxies. We provide effective temperature scales for B-type dwarfs in all\nthree galaxies and for giants and supergiants in the SMC and LMC. In each\ngalaxy a dependence on luminosity is found between the three classes with the\nunevolved dwarf objects having significantly higher effective temperatures.

If\nthe right-handed neutrino masses are of the same order as the electroweak\nsymmetry breaking scale, it is usually expected that these will not mediate any\nexperimentally observable effects.

If neutrino masses are \"accidentally small\",\nactive-sterile mixing angles can, according to current experimental bounds, be\nas large as several percent. If this is the case, I argue that the dominant\ndecay mode of light (M_H less than 130 GeV) Higgs bosons could be into an\nactive and a sterile neutrino. The sterile neutrino decays promptly into a\ncharge lepton and an on- or off-shell W-boson, so that the dominant Higgs boson\ndecay mode is H to leptons + jets + missing transverse energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2007 15:37:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2007 15:58:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-11"}
