This seems to clash\nwith the naive expectation that the curvature scalar should stay constant due\nto the Heisenberg equation of motion. Here, we show that the tadpole correction\nto the local expansion rate, which has been used in earlier analyses as an\nindicator of a decaying effective $\\Lambda$, is not gauge invariant. On the\nother hand, we construct a gauge invariant operator which measures the\nrenormalized curvature scalar smeared over an arbitrary window function, and we\nfind that there is no secular screening of this quantity (to any given order in\nperturbation theory).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jun 2007 02:40:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2007 01:27:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

It is shown that under certain\napproximations, it amounts to tunneling through two barriers: one while\novercoming the normal Coulomb barrier (which is of sudden nature) along the\nradial direction until the repulsive core is reached and thereafter through an\nadiabatic barrier along the neck degree of freedom while making transition from\na di-nuclear to a mono-nuclear regime through shape relaxation. A general\nfeature of this hybrid model is a steep fall-off of the fusion cross section,\nsharp increase of logarithmic derivative L(E) with decreasing energy and the\nastrophysical S-factor showing a maxima at deep sub-barrier energies\nparticularly for near symmetric systems. The model can explain the experimental\nfusion measurements for several systems ranging from near symmetric systems\nlike $^{58}Ni+^{64}Ni, ^{58}Ni+^{58}Ni$ and $ ^{58}Ni+^{69}Y$ to asymmetric one\nlike $^{16}O+^{208}Pb$ where the experimental findings are very surprising.\nSince the second tunneling is along the neck co-ordinate, it is further\nconjectured that deep sub-barrier fusion supression may not be observed for the\nfusion of highly asymmetric projectile target combinations where adiabatic\ntransition occurs automatically without any hindrance.

The main observation is that this procedure\nconnects categories of equivariant D-modules on flag varieties with categories\nof equivariant coherent sheaves on the Steinberg variety and its relatives.\nThis provides a direct connection between the geometry of finite and affine\nHecke algebras and braid groups, and a uniform geometric construction of all of\nthe categorical parameters for representations of real and complex reductive\ngroups.
