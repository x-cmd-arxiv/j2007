However, the commonly used constant overdensity criterion does not\nreflect the dynamical structure of haloes. Here we analyze dark matter\ncosmological simulations in order to obtain properties of haloes of different\nmasses focusing on the size of the region with zero mean radial velocity. Dark\nmatter inside this region is stationary, and thus the mass of this region is a\nmuch better approximation for the virial mass. We call this mass the static\nmass to distinguish from the commonly used constant overdensity mass. We also\nstudy the relation of this static mass with the traditional virial mass, and we\nfind that the matter inside galaxy-size haloes is underestimated by the virial\nmass by nearly a factor of two. At redshift zero the virial mass is close to\nthe static mass for cluster-size haloes. The same pattern - large haloes having\nM_vir > M_static - exists at all redshifts, but the transition mass M_0 = M_vir\n= M_static decreases dramatically with increasing redshift. When rescaled to\nthe same M_0 haloes clearly demonstrate a self-similar behaviour, which in a\nstatistical sense gives a relation between the static and virial mass. To our\nsurprise we find that the abundance of haloes with a given static mass, i.e.\nthe static mass function, is very accurately fitted by the Press & Schechter\napproximation at z=0, but this approximation breaks at higher redshifts.\nInstead, the virial mass function is well fitted as usual by the Sheth & Tormen\napproximation. We find an explanation why the static radius can be 2-3 times\nlarger as compared with the constant overdensity estimate. Applying the\nnon-stationary Jeans equation we find that the role of the pressure gradients\nis significantly larger for small haloes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2007 19:37:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Jun 2008 12:28:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

However, nuclei with Z=8 or 10 may not burn until\nhigher densities where the crust is solid and electron capture has made the\nnuclei neutron rich. We calculate the $S$ factor for fusion reactions of\nneutron rich nuclei including $^{24}$O + $^{24}$O and $^{28}$Ne + $^{28}$Ne. We\nuse a simple barrier penetration model. The $S$ factor could be further\nenhanced by dynamical effects involving the neutron rich skin. This possible\nenhancement in $S$ should be studied in the laboratory with neutron rich\nradioactive beams. We model the structure of the crust with molecular dynamics\nsimulations. We find that the crust of accreting neutron stars may contain\nmicro-crystals or regions of phase separation. Nevertheless, the screening\nfactors that we determine for the enhancement of the rate of thermonuclear\nreactions are insensitive to these features. Finally, we calculate the rate of\nthermonuclear $^{24}$O + $^{24}$O fusion and find that $^{24}$O should burn at\ndensities near $10^{11}$ g/cm$^3$. The energy released from this and similar\nreactions may be important for the temperature profile of the star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2007 17:53:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Apr 2008 00:05:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

For disorder ranging from weak to\nstrong levels of dilution, we identify Curie temperatures and calculate the\ncritical exponents nu, gamma, eta, and beta finding, per the Harris criterion,\ngood agreement with critical indices for the pure Heisenberg model where there\nis no disorder component. Moreover, we find that thermodynamic quantities (e.g.\nthe second moment of the magnetization per spin) self average at the\nferromagnetic transition temperature with relative fluctuations tending to zero\nwith increasing system size. We directly calculate effective critical exponents\nfor T > T_{c}, yielding values which may differ significantly from the critical\nindices for the pure system, especially in the presence of strong disorder.\nUltimately, the difference is only apparent, and eventually disappears when T\nis very close to T_{c}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2007 18:50:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2007 04:54:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2009 05:27:32 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2010 20:50:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-10"}

The integral flux above 300\nGeV is (4.6 +- 0.6{stat} +- 0.9{syst}) x 10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1}, corresponding\nto ~3.4% of the flux from the Crab Nebula above the same threshold.

We find that\nevolution in these two observables can be modeled by a simple evolution in the\ncluster gas mass fraction. Excluding cluster cores from measurements results in\nevolution more consistent with the self-similar model than when the entire\ncluster is used, indicating that the fraction of clusters with cool cores\nincreases with time, or that cool cores become more developed over time in\nthose clusters that have them; this is supported by direct study of the\nredshift dependence of central surface brightness, which increases in scatter\nand magnitude at low redshift.

CLePAPS is a tool developed for this purpose. It\ndistinguishes itself from other existing algorithms by the use of\nconformational letters, which are discretized states of 3D segmental structural\nstates. A letter corresponds to a cluster of combinations of the three angles\nformed by C_alpha pseudobonds of four contiguous residues. A substitution\nmatrix called CLESUM is available to measure similarity between any two such\nletters. CLePAPS regards an aligned fragment pair (AFP) as an ungapped string\npair with a high sum of pairwise CLESUM scores. Using CLESUM scores as the\nsimilarity measure, CLePAPS searches for AFPs by simple string comparison. The\ntransformation which best superimposes a highly similar AFP can be used to\nsuperimpose the structure pairs under comparison. A highly scored AFP which is\nconsistent with several other AFPs determines an initial alignment. CLePAPS\nthen joins consistent AFPs guided by their similarity scores to extend the\nalignment by several `zoom-in' iteration steps. A follow-up refinement produces\nthe final alignment. CLePAPS does not implement dynamic programming. The\nutility of CLePAPS is tested on various protein structure pairs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2007 08:38:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-11-01"}
