Here we reconsider\nthis issue. First, we note a peculiarity in the WMAP temperature likelihood's\nresponse to the source correction: Cosmological parameters do not respond to\nincreased source errors. An alternative and more direct method for treating\nthis error term acts more sensibly, and also shifts n_s by ~0.3 sigma closer to\nunity. Second, we re-examine the source fit used to correct the power spectrum.\nThis fit depends strongly on the galactic cut and the weighting of the map,\nindicating that either the source population or masking procedure is not\nisotropic. Jackknife tests appear inconsistent, causing us to assign large\nuncertainties to account for possible systematics. Third, we note that the WMAP\nteam's spectrum was computed with two different weighting schemes: uniform\nweights transition to inverse noise variance weights at l = 500. The fit\ndepends on such weighting schemes, so different corrections apply to each\nmultipole range. For the Kp2 mask used in cosmological analysis, we prefer\nsource corrections A = 0.012 +/- 0.005 muK^2 for uniform weighting and A =\n0.015 +/- 0.005 muK^2 for N_obs weighting. Correcting WMAP's spectrum\ncorrespondingly, we compute cosmological parameters with our alternative\nlikelihood, finding n_s = 0.970 +/- 0.017 and sigma_8 = 0.778 +/- 0.045 . This\nn_s is only 1.8 sigma from unity, compared to the ~2.6 sigma WMAP 3-year\nresult. Finally, an anomalous feature in the source spectrum at l<200 remains,\nmost strongly associated with W-band.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2007 17:34:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Several\nrecent surveys have found evidence for the existence of large-scale structure\nat high redshifts as well.

We find that recent\nnarrow-band surveys at z ~ 5 - 6.5 should find voids with characteristic scales\nof roughly 20 comoving Mpc and maximum diameters approaching 40 Mpc. This is\nconsistent with existing surveys, but a precise comparison is difficult because\nof the relatively small volumes probed so far. At z ~ 7 - 10, we expect\ncharacteristic void scales of ~ 14 - 20 comoving Mpc assuming that all galaxies\nwithin dark matter haloes more massive than 10^10 M_sun are observable. We find\nthat these characteristic scales are similar to the sizes of empty regions\nresulting from purely random fluctuations in the galaxy counts. As a result,\ntrue large-scale structure will be difficult to observe at z ~ 7 - 10, unless\ngalaxies in haloes with masses less than ~ 10^9 M_sun are visible.

We start from a small volume, where one can use a standard O(a)-improved\nrelativistic action for the b-quark, and compute two step scaling functions\nwhich relate the observables to the large volume ones.

The velocity interval of\nassociated metal lines extends for 700 km/s. In addition, saturated H I\nabsorption is detected in the blue damping wing of the main component. The\ncolumn density ratios of associated Al II, Al III, and Fe II lines indicate\nthat the absorbing material is ionized. 19 of in total 31 detected metal line\ncomponents are formed within peripheral H II regions, while only 12 components\nare associated with the predominantly neutral main absorber. For the main\nabsorber the observed abundance ratios of refractory elements to Zn range from\nGalactic warm disk [Si/Zn] = - 0.40, [Fe/Zn] = -1.10 to halo-like and\nessentially undepleted patterns. The dust-corrected metal abundances indicate a\nnucleosynthetic odd-even effect and might imply an anomalous depletion of Si\nrelative to Fe for two components, but otherwise do correspond to solar ratios.\nThe intrinsic average metallicity is almost solar [Fe/H] = -0.08, whereas the\nuncorrected average is [Zn/H] = -0.38. The ion abundances in the periphery\nconform with solar element composition. The detection of H II as well as the\nlarge variation in dust depletion for this sight line raises the question\nwhether in future studies of damped Ly alpha systems ionization and depletion\neffects have to be considered in further detail. Ionization effects, for\ninstance, may pretend an enrichment of alpha elements. An empirical recipe for\ndetecting H II regions is provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2007 16:28:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
