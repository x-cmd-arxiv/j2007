The apparent deficit of planets around massive stars is due to a\nstrong selection bias against early-type dwarfs in Doppler-based planet\nsearches. One method to circumvent the difficulties inherent to massive\nmain-sequence stars is to instead observe them after they have evolved onto the\nsubgiant branch. We show how the cooler atmospheres and slower rotation\nvelocities of subgiants make them ideal proxies for F- and A-type stars.

Using a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from the\nSDSS, we compare the colors and concentrations of satellites galaxies to those\nof central galaxies of the same stellar mass, adopting the hypothesis that the\nlatter are the progenitors of the former. On average, satellites are redder and\nmore concentrated than central galaxies of the same stellar mass.\nCentral-satellite pairs that are matched in both stellar mass and color,\nhowever, show no average concentration difference, indicating that the\ntransformation mechanisms affect color more than morphology. The color and\nconcentration differences of matched central-satellite pairs are completely\nindependent of the halo mass of the satellite galaxy, indicating that\nsatellite-specific transformation mechanisms are equally efficient in haloes of\nall masses. This strongly favors strangulation as the main quenching mechanism\nfor satellite galaxies. Finally, we determine the relative importance of\nsatellite quenching for the build-up of the red sequence. We find that roughly\n70 percent of red sequence satellite galaxies with a stellar mass of 10^9 Msun\nhad their star formation quenched as satellites.

In a general setup we present a series of\nresults concerning the interrelation of Simes' rejection curve and the\n(limiting) empirical distribution function of the $p$-values. Main objects\nunder investigation are largest (limiting) crossing points between these\nfunctions, which play a key role in deriving explicit formulas for EER and FDR.\nAs specific examples we investigate equi-correlated normal and $t$-variables in\nmore detail and compute the limiting EER and FDR theoretically and numerically.\nA surprising limit behavior occurs if these models tend to independence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2007 13:48:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-18"}

Short pulses enable direct observation of fast\nmolecular dynamics, whereas broad spectral bandwidth offers ways of controlling\nnonlinear optical processes by means of quantum interferences. Special care is\nusually taken to preserve the coherence of laser pulses as it determines the\naccuracy of a spectroscopic measurement. Here we present a new approach to\ncoherent Raman spectroscopy based on deliberately introduced noise, which\nincreases the spectral resolution, robustness and efficiency. We probe laser\ninduced molecular vibrations using a broadband laser pulse with intentionally\nrandomized amplitude and phase. The vibrational resonances result in and are\nidentified through the appearance of intensity correlations in the noisy\nspectrum of coherently scattered photons. Spectral resolution is neither\nlimited by the pulse bandwidth, nor sensitive to the quality of the temporal\nand spectral profile of the pulses. This is particularly attractive for the\napplications in microscopy, biological imaging and remote sensing, where\ndispersion and scattering properties of the medium often undermine the\napplicability of ultrafast lasers. The proposed method combines the efficiency\nand resolution of a coherent process with the robustness of incoherent light.\nAs we demonstrate here, it can be implemented by simply destroying the\ncoherence of a laser pulse, and without any elaborate temporal scanning or\nspectral shaping commonly required by the frequency-resolved spectroscopic\nmethods with ultrashort pulses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2007 20:35:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Ellipticals, spirals and irregular\ngalaxies all appear to occupy different regions of this parameter space. At the\nsame time, the Source Extractor (SE) program has become the mainstay to produce\nob ject catalogs from large image surveys. A logical next step would be to\nincorporate the structural parameters into the Source Extractor software. There\nare however several problems that arise: 1) the CAS parameters are fits to the\nimages and Source Extractor eschews fits in the interest of speed, 2) the\ndefinition of the structural parameters changed over time. Now that there is a\nclear and agreed-upon definition of the structural parameters, I am\nincorporating computed versions in the Source Extractor code (v2.5). The fitted\nCAS parameters are available for the GOODS-N/S fields and I compare the\ncomputed structural parameters to those found by the previous fits. My goal is\nto expand the source structure information in Source Extractor catalogs in\norder to improve automatic identification of sources, specifically of distant\ngalaxies.

We present a novel fashion to generate non-intersecting closed\nloops, starting from a tetrahedral tessellation of three space. The two phases\nthat we find admit the following interpretation: the usual Higgs phase and a\nnovel phase which is heralded by the appearance of effectively infinitely long\nloops. We compute the expectation value of the Wilson loop operator and that of\nthe Polyakov loop operator. The Wilson loop exhibits perimeter law behaviour in\nboth phases implying that the transition corresponds neither to the restoration\nof symmetry nor to confinement. The effective interaction between external\ncharges is screened in both phases, however there is a dramatic increase in the\npolarization cloud in the novel phase as shown by the energy shift introduced\nby the Wilson loop.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2007 08:54:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2010 18:15:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

To this aim, a convenient framework is to describe\nnoisy entangled resources as linear superpositions of non-Gaussian state and\nthermal states. Although the presence of the thermal component strongly reduces\nthe teleportation fidelity, noisy non-Gaussian states remain preferred\nresources when compared to noisy twin-beam Gaussian states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2007 10:17:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2008 11:34:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-19"}

Moreover, their effective mass can\nbe extremely small, of the order of $10^{-8} m_0$ ($m_0$ is the bare electron\nmass), and they constitute the lightest exciton-like quasi-particles in solids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2007 15:39:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-16"}

Much of the writing about quantum\nlogic circuits and quantum Turing machines has shown how these machines can\nsimulate an arbitrary unitary transformation on a finite number of qubits. The\nproblem of universality has been addressed most famously in a paper by Deutsch,\nand later by Bernstein and Vazirani as well as Kitaev and Solovay. The quantum\nlogic circuit model, developed by Feynman and Deutsch, has been more prominent\nin the research literature than Deutsch's quantum Turing machines. Quantum\nTuring machines form a class closely related to deterministic and probabilistic\nTuring machines and one might hope to find a universal machine in this class. A\nuniversal machine is the basis of a notion of programmability. The extent to\nwhich universality has in fact been established by the pioneers in the field is\nexamined and this key notion in theoretical computer science is scrutinised in\nquantum computing by distinguishing various connotations and concomitant\nresults and problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2007 15:45:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2007 13:48:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-22"}

We investigate both the\nstress relaxation following a fast deformation, and the effect of varying the\nstrain rate. We find a power law decay of the stress as a function of time,\ndown to a plateau stress, and a power law increase of the cell's elasticity as\na function of the strain rate. Interestingly, the exponents of these quantities\nviolate the linear superposition principle, indicating a nonlinear response. We\npropose that this is due to breaking of a fraction of the crosslinks during the\ndeformation process. The Soft Glassy Rheology Model accounts for the relation\nbetween the exponents we observe experimentally. This picture is consistent\nwith recent models of bond remodeling in the red blood cell's molecular\nstructure. Our results imply that the blood cell's mechanical behavior depends\ncritically on the deformation process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2007 15:51:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Waves with realistic periods of\nthree to five minutes are studied, after applying horizontal and vertical\noscillatory perturbations to the equilibrium model. Spurious reflections of\nshock waves from the upper boundary are minimized thanks to a special boundary\ncondition. This has allowed us to increase the duration of the simulations and\nto make it long enough to perform a statistical analysis of oscillations. The\nsimulations show that deep horizontal motions of the flux tube generate a slow\n(magnetic) mode and a surface mode. These modes are efficiently transformed\ninto a slow (acoustic) mode in the vA < cS atmosphere. The slow (acoustic) mode\npropagates vertically along the field lines, forms shocks and remains always\nwithin the flux tube. It might deposit effectively the energy of the driver\ninto the chromosphere. When the driver oscillates with a high frequency, above\nthe cut-off, non-linear wave propagation occurs with the same dominant driver\nperiod at all heights. At low frequencies, below the cut-off, the dominant\nperiod of oscillations changes with height from that of the driver in the\nphotosphere to its first harmonic (half period) in the chromosphere. Depending\non the period and on the type of the driver, different shock patterns are\nobserved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2007 15:56:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2008 13:39:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
