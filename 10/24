Report RR-6331, Oct. 2007","categories":"cs.DS","license":null,"abstract":"  We give a new algorithm for performing the distinct-degree factorization of a\npolynomial P(x) over GF(2), using a multi-level blocking strategy. The coarsest\nlevel of blocking replaces GCD computations by multiplications, as suggested by\nPollard (1975), von zur Gathen and Shoup (1992), and others. The novelty of our\napproach is that a finer level of blocking replaces multiplications by\nsquarings, which speeds up the computation in GF(2)[x]/P(x) of certain interval\npolynomials when P(x) is sparse. As an application we give a fast algorithm to\nsearch for all irreducible trinomials x^r + x^s + 1 of degree r over GF(2),\nwhile producing a certificate that can be checked in less time than the full\nsearch. Naive algorithms cost O(r^2) per trinomial, thus O(r^3) to search over\nall trinomials of given degree r. Under a plausible assumption about the\ndistribution of factors of trinomials, the new algorithm has complexity O(r^2\n(log r)^{3/2}(log log r)^{1/2}) for the search over all trinomials of degree r.\nOur implementation achieves a speedup of greater than a factor of 560 over the\nnaive algorithm in the case r = 24036583 (a Mersenne exponent). Using our\nprogram, we have found two new primitive trinomials of degree 24036583 over\nGF(2) (the previous record degree was 6972593).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2007 09:18:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-20"}

The basic principles which a gravitational\ntheory should follow, and their geometrical interpretation, are analysed in a\nbroad perspective which highlights the basic assumptions of General Relativity\nand suggests possible modifications which might be made. A number of such\npossible modifications are presented, focusing on certain specific classes of\ntheories: scalar-tensor theories, metric f(R) theories, Palatini f(R) theories,\nmetric-affine f(R) theories and Gauss--Bonnet theories. The characteristics of\nthese theories are fully explored and attention is payed to issues of dynamical\nequivalence between them. Also, cosmological phenomenology within the realm of\neach of the theories is discussed and it is shown that they can potentially\naddress the well-known cosmological problems. A number of viability criteria\nare presented: cosmological observations, Solar System tests, stability\ncriteria, existence of exact solutions for common vacuum or matter\nconfigurations etc. Finally, future perspectives in the field of modified\ngravity are discussed and the possibility for going beyond a trial-and-error\napproach to modified gravity is explored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2007 11:52:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-10"}

All these solutions have been obtained by first considering a\nplausible distribution of matter, and through the Einstein field equation, the\nspacetime metric of the geometry is determined. However, one may solve the\nEinstein field equation in the reverse direction, namely, one first considers\nan interesting and exotic spacetime metric, then finds the matter source\nresponsible for the respective geometry. In this manner, it was found that some\nof these solutions possess a peculiar property, namely 'exotic matter,'\ninvolving a stress-energy tensor that violates the null energy condition. These\ngeometries also allow closed timelike curves, with the respective causality\nviolations. These solutions are primarily useful as 'gedanken-experiments' and\nas a theoretician's probe of the foundations of general relativity, and include\ntraversable wormholes and superluminal 'warp drive' spacetimes.
