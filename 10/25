As part of a programme to understand\ntheir formation and evolution, we have investigated the stellar dynamics of a\nnumber of nearby objects in this class. We obtained long-slit spectra with\nVLT/FORS2 in the spectral region covering the near-infrared calcium triplet. In\nthis paper we focus on the well-known luminous blue compact galaxy ESO 338-IG04\n(Tololo 1924-416). A previous investigation, using Fabry-Perot interferometry,\nshowed that this galaxy has a chaotic H-alpha velocity field, indicating that\neither the galaxy is not in dynamical equilibrium or that H-alpha does not\ntrace the gravitational potential due to feedback from star formation. Along\nthe apparent major axis, the stellar and ionised gas velocities for the most\npart follow each other. The chaotic velocity field must therefore be a sign\nthat the young stellar population in ESO 338-IG04 is not in dynamical\nequilibrium. The most likely explanation, which is also supported by its\nmorphology, is that the galaxy has experienced a merger and that this has\ntriggered the current starburst. Summarising the results of our programme so\nfar, we note that emission-line velocity fields are not always reliable tracers\nof stellar motions, and go on to assess the implications for kinematic studies\nof similar galaxies at intermediate redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2007 18:55:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2007 13:13:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-19"}

A major clue to understanding this phenomenon has also emerged\nfrom our analysis, which shows that the bar fraction in spiral galaxies is a\nstrong function of stellar mass, integrated color and bulge prominence. The bar\nfraction in very massive, luminous spirals is about constant out to z ~ 0.84\nwhereas for the low mass, blue spirals it declines significantly with redshift\nbeyond z=0.3. There is also a slight preference for bars in bulge dominated\nsystems at high redshifts which may be an important clue towards the\nco-evolution of bars, bulges and black holes.

Dust scattered quasar light is an\nunlikely possibility that cannot be ruled out entirely. We conclude that the\nsource of the IGL is most likely to be a young stellar population distributed\nin a halo encompassing the radio and satellite galaxies, undergoing star\nformation at a rate greater than 57 Msun/yr. Within 70kpc of the radio core,\napproximately 44% of the star formation that is traced by UV light occurs in\nthis diffuse mode. The average UV colour of the IGL is bluer than the average\ngalaxy colour, and there is a trend for the IGL to become bluer with increasing\nradius from the radio galaxy. Both the galaxies and the IGL show a UV\ncolour--surface brightness relation which can be obtained by variations in\neither stellar population age or extinction. These observations show a\ndifferent, but potentially important mode of star formation, that is diffuse in\nnature. Star formation, as traced by UV light, occurs in two modes in the high\nredshift universe: one in the usual Lyman break galaxy clump-like mode on kpc\nscales, and the other in a diffuse mode over a large region surrounding massive\ngrowing galaxies. Such a mode of star formation can easily be missed by high\nangular resolution observations that are well suited for detecting high surface\nbrightness compact galaxies. Extrapolating from these results, it is possible\nthat a significant amount of star formation occurs in large extended regions\nwithin the halos of the most massive galaxies forming at high redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2007 10:45:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Furthermore, we investigate at what radius (or\noverdensity) one should measure the integrated SZE and define cluster mass so\nas to achieve the tightest possible scaling. We find that the measure of Y with\nthe least scatter is always obtained within a smaller radius than that at which\nthe mass is defined; e.g. for M_{200} (M_{500}) the scatter is least for\nY_{500} (Y_{1100}).

In this paper starting out from\nnonequilibrium entropy evolution equation we proved that a new entropy decrease\ncould spontaneously emerge in nonequilibrium system with internal attractive\ninteraction. This new entropy decrease coexists with the traditional law of\nentropy increase, both of them countervail each other, so that the total\nentropy of isolated system can be able to decrease. It not only makes isolated\nsystem but also helps open system to produce self-organizing structure. We\nfirst derived a statistical formula for this new entropy decrease rate, and\ncompared it both in mathematical form and in microscopic physical foundation\nwith the statistical formula for the law of entropy increase which was derived\nby us some years ago.

SGDP is compatible with the current level of gate\ncharacterization in conventional ASIC cell libraries, and as a result, it can\nbe easily incorporated into commercial STA tools to improve their accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2007 08:13:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-09"}

Unitarity is preserved by coupling\nthe fields to additional degrees of freedom (heavy fields) which introduce the\nrest frame. Using the Equivalence Principle, we define these theories in\narbitrary curved spacetime. We then confront the trans-Planckian question of\ninflationary cosmology. When dissipation increases with the energy, the quantum\nfield describing adiabatic perturbations is completely damped at the onset of\ninflation. However it still exists as a composite operator made with the\nadditional fields. And when these are in their ground state, the standard power\nspectrum obtains if the threshold energy is much larger that the Hubble\nparameter. In fact, as the energy redshifts below the threshold, the composite\noperator behaves as if it were a free field endowed with standard vacuum\nfluctuations. The relationship between our models and the Brane World scenarios\nstudied by Libanov and Rubakov displaying similar effects is discussed. The\nsignatures of dissipation will be studied in a forthcoming paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2007 14:00:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Jun 2008 16:35:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We analyse how the orbital parameters in a system are\nmodified under mass loss and mass exchange among its binary components and\npropose a model for enhanced mass-loss from the AGB star due to tidal\ninteraction with its companion, which allows a smooth transition between the\nwind and Roche-lobe overflow mass-loss regimes. We explicitly follow its effect\nalong the orbit on the change of eccentricity and orbital semi-major axis, as\nwell as the effect of accretion by the companion. We calculate timescales for\nthe variation of these orbital parameters and compare them to the tidal\ncircularisation timescale. We find that in many cases, due to the enhanced mass\nloss of the AGB component at orbital phases closer to the periastron, the net\neccentricity growth rate in one orbit is comparable to the rate of tidal\ncircularisation. We show that with this eccentricity enhancing mechanism it is\npossible to reproduce the orbital period and eccentricity of the Sirius system,\nwhich under the standard assumptions of binary interaction is expected to be\ncircularised.

This has culminated in a ``Universal'' X-ray luminosity function\n(XLF) for high mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs). However, a number of methods have\nbeen used to convert from source intensities to luminosities when creating\nthese XLFs. We have taken advantage of the XMM-Newton observations of the\nnearby starbursting spiral galaxy NGC 253 to test some of these methods. We\nfind the luminosities derived from these various methods to vary by a factor of\n$\\sim$3.

We therefore conclude that a more\nconsistent approach is required for determining the true Universal XLF for\nHMXBs. Ideally, this would involve individual spectral fitting of each X-ray\nsource. Certainly, the line-of-sight absorption should be determined from the\nobservations rather than assuming Galactic absorption. We find the best\napproach for obtaining an XLF from low-count data to be the splitting of the\nX-ray sources into two or more intensity intervals, and obtaining a conversion\nfrom intensity to flux for each group from spectral modelling of the summed\nspectrum of that group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2007 15:27:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-26"}
