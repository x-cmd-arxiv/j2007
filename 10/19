It replaces Grothendieck's notion of differential\noperator on a commutative algebra in such a way that derivations of the\ncommutative algebra are replaced by DDer(A), the bimodule of double\nderivations. Our differential operators act not on the algebra A itself but\nrather on F(A), a certain `Fock space' associated to any noncommutative algebra\nA in a functorial way. The corresponding algebra D(F(A)), of differential\noperators, is filtered and gr D(F(A)), the associated graded algebra, is\ncommutative in some `twisted' sense. The resulting double Poisson structure on\ngr D(F(A)) is closely related to the one introduced by Van den Bergh.\nSpecifically, we prove that gr D(F(A))=F(T_A(DDer(A)), provided A is smooth.\n  It is crucial for our construction that the Fock space F(A) carries an\nextra-structure of a wheelgebra, a new notion closely related to the notion of\na wheeled PROP. There are also notions of Lie wheelgebras, and so on. In that\nlanguage, D(F(A)) becomes the universal enveloping wheelgebra of a Lie\nwheelgebroid of double derivations.\n  In the second part of the paper we show, extending a classical construction\nof Koszul to the noncommutative setting, that any Ricci-flat, torsion-free\nbimodule connection on DDer(A) gives rise to a second order (wheeled)\ndifferential operator, a noncommutative analogue of the BV-operator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Oct 2007 19:55:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2007 17:17:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2010 18:16:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-29"}

In\nthis paper, I investigate the possibility for interpreting the observed\ndiscrepancy between the GRB rate history and the star formation rate history by\nthe cosmic metallicity evolution, motivated by the observation that the cosmic\nmetallicity evolves with redshift and GRBs prefer to occur in low metallicity\ngalaxies.

Then,\nadopting a simple model for the relation between the GRB production and the\ncosmic metallicity history as proposed by Langer & Norman, I show that the\nobserved redshift distribution of the Swift GRBs can be reproduced with a\nfairly good accuracy. Although the results are limited by the small size of the\nGRB sample and the poorly understood selection biases in detection and\nlocalization of GRBs and in redshift determination, they suggest that GRBs\ntrace both the star formation and the metallicity evolution. If the star\nformation history can be accurately measured with other approaches, which is\npresumably achievable in the near future, it will be possible to determine the\ncosmic metallicity evolution with the study on the redshift distribution of\nGRBs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Oct 2007 20:55:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 May 2008 15:59:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-06"}

Using these data the bulk\nviscosities are also determined in the region where $T/T_c < 2$. They are\nroughly one order of magnitude smaller than the shear viscosities. Our next\ntarget is to determine the transport coefficients more precisely by a\nmaximum-entropy method. For this purpose the most effective method may be to\nadopt an anisotropic lattice. In this report, we study the possible systematic\nerror due to the deformation of the anisotropic lattice at short distances.\nNear the critical temperature, it is found that the standard action suffers\nfrom a large deformation on the anisotropic lattice at short distances, while\nthe deformation is slight for Iwasaki's improved action. To reduce the\nfluctuation of the Matsubara Green function, the improvement of the energy\nmomentum tensor operator by using clover-type loops is promising. We are also\nattempting to apply the multi-level algorithm to reduce fluctuation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Oct 2007 03:04:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Qualitative analysis of key (but yet unappreciated) linear phenomena in\nstratified hydrodynamic Keplerian flows: (i) the occurrence of a vortex mode,\nas a consequence of strato-rotational balance, with its transient dynamics;\n(ii) the generation of spiral-density waves (also called inertia-gravity or\n$g\\Omega$ waves) by the vortex mode through linear mode coupling in shear\nflows. Methods. Non-modal analysis of linearized Boussinesq equations written\nin the shearing sheet approximation of accretion disk flows. Results. It is\nshown that the combined action of rotation and stratification introduces a new\ndegree of freedom -- vortex mode perturbation -- which is linearly coupled with\nthe spiral-density waves. These two modes are jointly able to extract energy\nfrom the background flow and they govern the disk dynamics in the small-scale\nrange. The transient behavior of these modes is determined by the non-normality\nof the Keplerian shear flow. Tightly leading vortex mode perturbations undergo\nsubstantial transient growth, then, becoming trailing, inevitably generate\ntrailing spiral-density waves by linear mode coupling. This course of events --\ntransient growth plus coupling -- is particularly pronounced for perturbation\nharmonics with comparable azimuthal and vertical scales and it renders the\nenergy dynamics similar to the 3D unbounded plane Couette flow case.\nConclusions. Our investigation strongly suggests that the so-called bypass\nconcept of turbulence, which has been recently developed by the hydrodynamic\ncommunity for spectrally stable shear flows, can also be applied to Keplerian\ndisks. This conjecture may be confirmed by appropriate numerical simulations\nthat take in account the vertical stratification and consequent mode coupling\nin the high Reynolds number regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Oct 2007 08:21:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2007 06:36:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

A motivating factor is the existence of many different methods of\nestimation, leading to possibly competing estimators. We consider here three\ndifferent types of aggregation: model selection (MS) aggregation, convex (C)\naggregation and linear (L) aggregation. The objective of (MS) is to select the\noptimal single estimator from the list; that of (C) is to select the optimal\nconvex combination of the given estimators; and that of (L) is to select the\noptimal linear combination of the given estimators. We are interested in\nevaluating the rates of convergence of the excess risks of the estimators\nobtained by these procedures.

The system is a modified Lorentz gas in which the fixed\nscatterers exchange energy with the gas of particles, and the thermostats are\nmodelled by two Nos\\'e-Hoover thermostats applied at the boundaries of the\nsystem. The transient fluctuation relation, which holds only for a precise\nchoice of the initial ensemble, is verified at all times, as expected. Times\nlonger than the mesoscopic scale, needed for local equilibrium to be settled,\nare required if a different initial ensemble is considered. This shows how the\ntransient fluctuation relation asymptotically leads to the steady state\nrelation when, as explicitly checked in our systems, the condition found in\n[D.J.

The quantity $\\zW$ satisfies with good accuracy the fluctuation relation\nfor times larger than the mesoscopic time scale; the quantity $\\zL$ appears to\nbegin a monotonic convergence after such times.

The LFs of the\nblue/late and total samples are well represented by steep Schechter functions\nevolving in luminosity with increasing redshifts. The volume density of the LFs\nof the red/early populations decreases with increasing redshift. The shape of\nthe red/early LFs shows an excess of faint red dwarfs with respect to the\nextrapolation of a flat Schechter function and can be represented by the sum of\ntwo Schechter functions. Our model for galaxy formation in the hierarchical\nclustering scenario, which also includes external feedback due to a diffuse UV\nbackground, shows a general broad agreement with the LFs of both populations,\nthe larger discrepancies being present at the faint end for the red population.\nHints on the nature of the red dwarf population are given on the basis of their\nstellar mass and spatial distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Oct 2007 14:03:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
