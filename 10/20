Contradictory results appeared in the literature\nregarding disk fragmentation at tens of AU from the central star are likely due\nto the different treatment of radiation physics as well as reflecting different\ninitial conditions. Further progress on the subject requires extensive\ncomparisons between different codes with the requirement that the same initial\nconditions are adopted. It is discussed how the local conditions of the disks\nundergoing fragmentation at $R < 25$ AU in recent SPH simulations are in rough\nagreement with the prediction of analytical models, with small differences\nbeing likely related to the inability of analytical models to account for the\ndynamics and thermodynamics of three-dimensional spiral shocks. We report that\nradically different adaptive hydrodynamical codes, SPH and adaptive mesh\nrefinement (AMR), yield very similar results on disk fragmentation at\ncomparable resolution in the simple case of an isothermal equation of state. A\nhigh number of refinements in AMR codes is necessary but not sufficient to\ncorrectly follow fragmentation, rather an initial resolution of the grid high\nenough to capture the wavelength of the strongest spiral modes when they are\nstill barely nonlinear is essential. These tests represent a useful benchmark\nand a starting point for a forthcoming code comparison with realistic radiation\nphysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Oct 2007 17:58:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-22"}

Unlike most of\nthe current high redshift SN searches, this survey was specifically designed to\nestimate the rate for both type Ia and core collapse (CC) SNe. We counted the\nSNe discovered in a selected galaxy sample measuring SN rate per unit blue band\nluminosity. Our analysis is based on a sample of ~43000 galaxies and on 25\nspectroscopically confirmed SNe plus 64 selected SN candidates. Our approach is\naimed at obtaining a direct comparison of the high redshift and local rates and\nat investigating the dependence of the rates on specific galaxy properties,\nmost notably their colour. The type Ia SN rate, at mean redshift z=0.3, amounts\nto 0.22^{+0.10+0.16}_{-0.08 -0.14} h_{70}^2 SNu, while the CC SN rate, at\nz=0.21, is 0.82^{+0.31 +0.30}_{-0.24 -0.26} h_{70}^2 SNu. The quoted errors are\nthe statistical and systematic uncertainties. With respect to local value, the\nCC SN rate at z=0.2 is higher by a factor of ~2 already at redshift, whereas\nthe type Ia SN rate remains almost constant. This implies that a significant\nfraction of SN Ia progenitors has a lifetime longer than 2-3 Gyr. We also\nmeasured the SN rates in the red and blue galaxies and found that the SN Ia\nrate seems to be constant in galaxies of different colour, whereas the CC SN\nrate seems to peak in blue galaxies, as in the local Universe. SN rates per\nunit volume were found to be consistent with other measurements showing a\nsteeper evolution with redshift for CC SNe with respect to SNe Ia. Finally we\nhave exploited the link between star formation (SF) and SN rates to predict the\nevolutionary behaviour of the SN rates and compare it with the path indicated\nby observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Oct 2007 19:32:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

GW measurements can\nlocalize the position of a coalescing binary on the sky to an ellipse with a\nmajor axis of a few tens of arcminutes to a few degrees, depending on source\nredshift, and a minor axis which is $2 - 4$ times smaller. Neglecting weak\ngravitational lensing, the GWs would also determine the source's luminosity\ndistance to better than percent accuracy for close sources, degrading to\nseveral percent for more distant sources. Weak lensing cannot, in fact, be\nneglected and is expected to limit the accuracy with which distances can be\nfixed to errors no less than a few percent. Assuming a well-measured cosmology,\nthe source's redshift could be inferred with similar accuracy. GWs alone can\nthus pinpoint a binary to a three-dimensional ``pixel'' which can help guide\nsearches for the hosts of these events. We examine the time evolution of this\npixel, studying it at merger and at several intervals before merger. One day\nbefore merger, the major axis of the error ellipse is typically larger than its\nfinal value by a factor of $\\sim 1.5-6$. The minor axis is larger by a factor\nof $\\sim 2-9$, and, neglecting lensing, the error in the luminosity distance is\nlarger by a factor of $\\sim 1.5-7$. This large change over a short period of\ntime is due to spin-induced precession, which is strongest in the final days\nbefore merger. The evolution is slower as we go back further in time.

The problem is to choose a linear equalizer and a\npartial response target filter such that the combination produces the best\ndetection performance. Instead of using the traditional approach of MMSE\nequalization, we directly seek all equalizer and target pairs that yield\noptimal detection performance in terms of the sequence or symbol error rate.\nThis leads to a new notion of a posteriori equivalence between the equalized\nand target channels with a simple characterization in terms of their underlying\nprobability distributions. Using this characterization we show the surprising\nexistence an infinite family of equalizer and target pairs for which any\nmaximum a posteriori (MAP) based detector designed for the target channel is\nsimultaneously MAP optimal for the equalized channel. For channels whose input\nsymbols have equal energy, such as q-PSK, the MMSE equalizer designed with a\nmonic target constraint yields a solution belonging to this optimal family of\ndesigns. Although, these designs produce IIR target filters, the ideas are\nextended to design good FIR targets.
