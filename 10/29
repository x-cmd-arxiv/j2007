The dimming of distant Type\nIa supernovae suggests that the expansion rate is accelerating, as if driven by\nvacuum energy, and this has been indirectly substantiated through studies of\nangular anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and of spatial\ncorrelations in the large-scale structure (LSS) of galaxies. However there is\nno compelling direct evidence yet for (the dynamical effects of) dark energy.\nThe precision CMB data can be equally well fitted without dark energy if the\nspectrum of primordial density fluctuations is not quite scale-free and if the\nHubble constant is lower globally than its locally measured value. The LSS data\ncan also be satisfactorily fitted if there is a small component of hot dark\nmatter, as would be provided by neutrinos of mass 0.5 eV. Although such an\nEinstein-de Sitter model cannot explain the SNe Ia Hubble diagram or the\nposition of the `baryon acoustic oscillation' peak in the autocorrelation\nfunction of galaxies, it may be possible to do so e.g. in an inhomogeneous\nLemaitre-Tolman-Bondi cosmology where we are located in a void which is\nexpanding faster than the average. Such alternatives may seem contrived but\nthis must be weighed against our lack of any fundamental understanding of the\ninferred tiny energy scale of the dark energy.

The strength of these criteria is\nillustrated by showing that they are stronger than several other well-known\nentanglement criteria (the fidelity criterion, violation of Mermin-type\nseparability inequalities, the Laskowski-\\.Zukowski criterion and the\nD\\\"ur-Cirac criterion), and also by showing their great noise robustness for a\nvariety of multiqubit states, including N-qubit GHZ states and Dicke states.\nFurthermore, for N greater than or equal to 3 they can detect bound entangled\nstates. For all these states, the required number of measurement settings for\nimplementation of the entanglement criteria is shown to be only N+1. If one\nchooses the familiar Pauli matrices as single-qubit observables, the\ninequalities take the form of bounds on the anti-diagonal matrix elements of a\nstate in terms of its diagonal matrix elements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2007 12:15:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2007 14:07:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 29 Apr 2008 23:35:01 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 3 Sep 2008 10:02:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-03"}

This peculiarity has been employed to measure\nmagnetic field strengths in quiet Sun regions. However, the methods applied so\nfar assume the magnetic field to be constant in the resolution element. The\nassumption is clearly insufficient to describe the complex quiet Sun magnetic\nfields, biasing the results of the measurements. We present the first syntheses\nof MnI lines in realistic quiet Sun model atmospheres. The syntheses show how\nthe MnI lines weaken with increasing field strength. In particular, kG magnetic\nconcentrations produce NnI 5538 circular polarization signals (Stokes V) which\ncan be up to two orders of magnitude smaller than the weak magnetic field\napproximation prediction. Consequently, (1) the polarization emerging from an\natmosphere having weak and strong fields is biased towards the weak fields, and\n(2) HFS features characteristic of weak fields show up even when the magnetic\nflux and energy are dominated by kG fields. For the HFS feature of MnI 5538 to\ndisappear the filling factor of kG fields has to be larger than the filling\nfactor of sub-kG fields. Stokes V depends on magnetic field inclination\naccording to the simple consine law. Atmospheres with unresolved velocities\nproduce asymmetric line profiles, which cannot be reproduced by simple\none-component model atmospheres.

In this paper\nit is shown that the recently introduced domain-decomposed deflation subspaces\ncan be propagated along the field trajectories generated by the Hybrid Monte\nCarlo (HMC) algorithm with a modest effort. The quark forces that drive the\nsimulation may then be computed using a deflation-accelerated solver for the\nlattice Dirac equation. As a consequence, the computer time required for the\nsimulations is significantly reduced and an improved scaling behaviour of the\nsimulation algorithm with respect to the quark mass is achieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2007 13:09:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

However,\nthis so-called second solar spectrum is full of mysterious spectral features,\nwhich cannot be understood with simplified polarization transfer theories, thus\nsuggesting that the underlying scattering physics is more complex than\npreviously thought. In this paper we argue that the physical understanding of\nthe second solar spectrum requires the consideration of scattering processes in\nmultilevel atomic models, taking fully into account the transfer of atomic\npolarization among all the levels involved. The consideration of lower-level\natomic polarization leads to non-linear and non-local coupled sets of\nequations, even for the two-level model atom case considered in this paper. The\nunknowns of the problem are the irreducible tensor components of the atomic\ndensity matrix whose self-consistent values have first to be obtained to be\nable to calculate the emergent Stokes profiles. To solve numerically this\nnon-LTE problem of the second kind we present some iterative methods that are\nvery suitable for developing a general multilevel scattering polarization code.\nWe demonstrate that there exists metastable-level atomic polarization in the\nsolar chromosphere, which suggests that the solution to some\nrecently-formulated \"paradoxes\" is to be found by carefully revising our\ncurrent ideas about the chromospheric magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2007 13:25:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-30"}

The combined use of one- and two-particle microrheology allows us\nto differentiate between colloidal glasses and gels - the glass is homogenous,\nwhereas the colloidal gel shows a considerable degree of heterogeneity on\nlength scales larger than 0.5 micrometer. Despite this characteristic\ndifference, both systems exhibit similar rheological behavior which evolve in\ntime with aging, showing a crossover from a single power-law frequency\ndependence of the viscoelastic modulus to a sum of two power laws. The\ncrossover occurs at a time $t_{0}$, which defines a mechanical transition\npoint. We found that the data acquired during the aging of different samples\ncan be collapsed onto a single master curve by scaling the aging time with\n$t_{0}$. This raises questions about the prior interpretation of two power laws\nin terms of a superposition of an elastic network embedded in a viscoelastic\nbackground.\n  Keywords: Aging, colloidal glass, passive microrheology\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2007 15:45:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
