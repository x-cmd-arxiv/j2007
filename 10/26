Current models lack,\nhowever, a key aspect of human dynamics, i.e. several tasks require, or are\ndetermined by, interactions between individuals. Here we introduce a minimal\nqueueing model of human dynamics that already takes into account human-human\ninteractions. To achieve large scale simulations we obtain a coarse-grained\nversion of the model, allowing us to reach large interevent times and reliable\nscaling exponents estimations. Using this we show that the interevent\ndistribution of interacting tasks exhibit the scaling exponents $\\alpha=2$, 3/2\nand a series of numerable values between 3/2 and 1. This work demonstrates\nthat, within the context of queueing models of human dynamics, interactions\nchange the exponent of the power-law distributed interevent times.

According to the previous studies under the\none fluid approach, the thermal instability is suppressed due to the magnetic\npressure. However, the previous studies did not precisely consider the effect\nof the ion-neutral friction, since they did not treat the flow as two fluid\nwhich is composed of ions and neutrals. Then, we revisit the effect of the\nion-neutral friction of the two fluid to the growth of the thermal instability.\nAccording to our study, (1) The instability which is characterized by the mean\nmolecular weight of neutrals is suppressed via the ion-neutral friction only\nwhen the magnetic field and the friction are sufficiently strong. The\nsuppression owing to the friction occurs even along the field line. If the\nmagnetic field and the friction are not so strong, the instability is not\nstabilized. (2) The effect of the friction and the magnetic field is mainly\nreduction of the growth rate of the thermal instability of weakly ionized\nplasma. (3) The effect of friction does not affect the critical wavelength\nlambdaF for the thermal instability. This yields that lambdaF of the weakly\nionized plasma is not enlarged even when the magnetic field exists.

This is reasoned by the\ninterdisciplinary character of the associated questions ranging from the\nmolecular origin of the loss of biological functionality as, for example, in\nAlzheimer's disease to the development of organic circuits for biosensory\napplications. In this lecture, we focus on the analysis of mesoscopic models\nfor protein folding, aggregation, and hybrid systems of soft and solid\ncondensed matter. The simplicity of the coarse-grained models allows for a more\nuniversal description of the notoriously difficult problem of protein folding.\nIn this approach, classifications of structure formation processes with respect\nto the conformational pseudophases are possible. This is similar in aggregation\nand adsorption processes, where the individual folding propensity is influenced\nby external forces. The main problem in studies of conformational transitions\nis that the sequences of amino acids proteins are built up of are necessarily\nof finite length and, therefore, a thermodynamic limit does not exist.

Bit strings\nderived from speckle can be used for a variety of security purposes such as\nidentification, authentication, anti-counterfeiting, secure key storage, random\nnumber generation and tamper protection. The choice of laser speckle as a\nsource of random keys is quite natural, given the chaotic properties of\nspeckle. However, this same chaotic behaviour also causes reproducibility\nproblems. Cryptographic protocols require either zero noise or very low noise\nin their inputs; hence the issue of error rates is critical to applications of\nlaser speckle in cryptography.

We refer to these two models as the FKLS model, and\nthe flipped model. Both of these models are based on a reformulation of the\ncross-simplicity constraints. This paper has two main parts. First, we clarify\nthe structure of the reformulated cross-simplicity constraints and the nature\nof their quantum imposition in the new models. In particular we show that in\nthe FKLS model, quantum cross-simplicity implies no restriction on states. The\ndeeper reason for this is that, with the symplectic structure relevant for\nFKLS, the reformulated cross-simplicity constraints, in a certain relevant\nsense, are now \\emph{first class}, and this causes the coherent state method of\nimposing the constraints, key in the FKLS model, to fail to give any\nrestriction on states. Nevertheless, the cross-simplicity can still be seen as\nimplemented via suppression of intertwiner degrees of freedom in the dynamical\npropagation. In the second part of the paper, we investigate area spectra in\nthe models. The results of these two investigations will highlight how, in the\nflipped model, the Hilbert space of states, as well as the spectra of area\noperators exactly match those of loop quantum gravity, whereas in the FKLS (and\nBarrett-Crane) models, the boundary Hilbert spaces and area spectra are\ndifferent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2007 08:03:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2007 14:31:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The decrease in the star formation rate\nwith increasing Galactocentric distance is responsible for the existence of a\nnegative radial metallicity gradient in the thin disk.

Combinations of runs of the 1-D photoionization code NEBU are\nused to explore alternative models for the giant H II region shell I Zw 18 NW.\nAcceptable models are obtained, which represent schematically an incomplete\nshell comprising radiation-bounded condensations embedded in a low-density\nmatter-bounded diffuse medium. The thermal pressure contrast between gas\ncomponents is about a factor 7. The diffuse phase can be in pressure balance\nwith the hot superbubble fed by mechanical energy from the inner massive star\ncluster. The failure of previous modellings is ascribed to (1) the adoption of\nan inadequate small-scale gas density distribution, which proves critical when\nthe collisional excitation of hydrogen contributes significantly to the cooling\nof the gas, and possibly (2) a too restrictive implementation of Wolf-Rayet\nstars in synthetic stellar cluster spectral energy distributions.

In this paper constraints on the different profiles and the\nsurvival probability of the clumps are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2007 15:28:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-29"}

We create synthetic Galactic maps which we call Pencil\nBeam Maps (PBMs) of the following observables: line-of-sight velocities, the\ncorresponding velocity dispersion, and the stellar number density that are\nfunctions of distance from the observer. We show that such maps can be used to\ninfer spiral structure parameters, such as pattern speed, solar phase angle,\nand number of arms. The mean line-of-sight velocity and velocity dispersion are\naffected by up to ~35 km/s which is well within the detectable limit for\nforthcoming radial velocity surveys. One can measure the pattern speed by\nsearching for imprints of resonances. In the case of a two-armed spiral\nstructure it can be inferred from the radius of a high velocity dispersion ring\nsituated at the 2:1 ILR. This information, however, must be combined with\ninformation related to the velocities and stellar number density in order to\ndistinguish from a four-armed structure. If the pattern speed is such that the\n2:1 ILR is hidden inside the Galactic bulge the 2:1 OLR will be present in the\nouter Galaxy and thus can equivalently be used to estimate the pattern speed.\nOnce the pattern speed is known the solar angle can be estimated from the\nline-of-sight velocities and the number density PBMs. Forthcoming radial\nvelocity surveys are likely to provide powerful constraints of the structure of\nthe Milky Way disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2007 15:42:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Comparing these\npopulations, we find a highly significant lack of GC LMXBs at the low (0.3-8\nkeV) X-ray luminosities (in the $\\sim 10^{36}$ to $\\sim 4\\times10^{37}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$ range) probed with our observations. This result conflicts with the\nproposition that all LMXBs are formed in GCs. This lack of low-luminosity\nsources in GCs is consistent with continuous LMXB formation due to stellar\ninteractions and with the transition from persistent to transient LMXBs. The\nobserved cut-off X-ray luminosity favors a predominance of LMXBs with\nmain-sequence donors instead of ultra-compact binaries with white-dwarf donors;\nultra-compacts could contribute significantly only if their disks are not\naffected by X-ray irradiation. Our results suggest that current theories of\nmagnetic stellar wind braking may work rather better for the unevolved\ncompanions of GC LMXBs than for field LMXBs and cataclysmic variables in the\nGalaxy, where these companions may be somewhat evolved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2007 15:50:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2007 12:55:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-29"}
