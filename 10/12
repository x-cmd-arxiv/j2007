The K divisor is characterized by the condition of linear dependence\nof a set of quadrics containing C and naturally associated to a degree g\neffective divisor on C. K counts the number of intersections of special\nvarieties on the Jacobian torus defined in terms of Theta_s. It also identifies\nsections of line bundles on the moduli space of algebraic curves, closely\nrelated to the Mumford isomorphism, whose zero loci characterize special\nvarieties in the framework of the Andreotti-Mayer approach to the Schottky\nproblem, a result which also reproduces the only previously known case g=4.\nThis new approach, based on the combinatorics of determinantal relations for\ntwo-fold products of holomorphic abelian differentials, sheds light on basic\nstructures, and leads to the explicit expressions, in terms of theta functions,\nof the canonical basis of the abelian holomorphic differentials and of the\nconstant defining the Mumford form. Furthermore, the metric on the moduli space\nof canonical curves, induced by the Siegel metric, which is shown to be\nequivalent to the Kodaira-Spencer map of the square of the Bergman reproducing\nkernel, is explicitly expressed in terms of the Riemann period matrix only, a\nresult previously known for the trivial cases g=2 and g=3. Finally, the induced\nSiegel volume form is expressed in terms of the Mumford form.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2007 16:58:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-12"}

This enables us to\n\\emph{coherently} search for all three stages of the coalescence of\nnon-spinning binary black holes using a single template bank. Taking our\nmotivation from these results, we propose a family of template waveforms which\ncan model the inspiral, merger, and ring-down stages of the coalescence of\nnon-spinning binary black holes that follow quasi-circular inspiral. This\ntwo-dimensional template family is explicitly parametrized by the physical\nparameters of the binary.

In this text we shall discuss many\nresults by different authors, following essentially the direction typified by\nthe pioneering work of J. Sally. Our personal view of the subject is most\nvisibly expressed by the presentation of Chapters 1 and 2 in which we discuss\nthe use of the superficial elements and related devices. Basic techniques will\nbe stressed with the aim of reproving recent results by using a more elementary\napproach. Over the past few years several papers have appeared which extend\nclassical results on the theory of Hilbert functions to the case of filtered\nmodules. The extension of the theory to the case of general filtrations on a\nmodule has one more important motivation. Namely, we have interesting\napplications to the study of graded algebras which are not associated to a\nfiltration, in particular the Fiber cone and the Sally-module. We show here\nthat each of these algebras fits into certain short exact sequences, together\nwith algebras associated to filtrations. Hence one can study the Hilbert\nfunction and the depth of these algebras with the aid of the know-how we got in\nthe case of a filtration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2007 20:39:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2009 15:12:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The final solution is expressed in an asymptotic series\nin powers of model-specific matter inputs, suppressed by a small dimensionless\nconstant, relative to the pure Kodama state. We discuss this expansion from\ndifferent perspectives. Lastly, we explicitly show how the solution to the\nquantized constraints establishes a wavefunction of the universe with a\npredetermined semiclassical limit built in as a boundary condition on quantized\ngravity in the full theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2007 23:40:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2008 20:58:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-11"}

It is found that the discrepancies between WMAP3 data and\nthe Lambda CDM model, such as suppression of the spectrum at l=2, may be\nexplained to a certain extent by the finite length of inflation for inflation\nof close to 60 e-folds. The small-field inflation model with scalar\nmatter-dominated pre-inflation provides the best fit to the WMAP3 data among\nthe models considered. Relatively large changes in the angular TT power\nspectrum occur in response to small changes in inflation length in the\nradiation-dominated pre-inflation models, and half cases do not fit well with\nthe observed data. This behavior is considered to be attributable to the\noscillatory behavior of the power spectrum. The scalar matter-dominated case is\nthus preferred to the radiation-dominated case of pre-inflation, independent of\nthe length of inflation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Oct 2007 05:15:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-15"}

Using this assumption, we\ncalculate the IFMRs for stars of different metallicities.We find that the IFMRs\ndepends strongly on the metallicity, i.e. $Z=0.0001, 0.0003, 0.001, 0.004,\n0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.08$ and 0.1.

A linear fit of the initial-final mass\nrelationship in NGC 2099 (M37) shows a potential evidence of the effect of\nmetallicity on the IFMR.

Thus in this \"frozen\nstar\" scenario, as distant observers, we could never observe matter falling\ninto a BH, neither could we see any \"real\" BH other than primordial ones, since\nall other BHs are believed to be formed by matter falling towards singularity.\nHere we first obtain the exact solution for a pressureless mass shell around a\npre-existing BH. The metrics inside and interior to the shell are all different\nfrom the Schwarzschild metric of the enclosed mass. The metric interior to the\nshell can be transformed to the Schwarzschild metric for a slower clock which\nis dependent of the location and mass of the shell. Another result is that\nthere does not exist a singularity nor event horizon in the shell. Therefore\nthe \"frozen star\" scenario is incorrect. We also show that for all practical\nastrophysical settings the in-falling time recorded by an external observer is\nsufficiently short that future astrophysical instruments may be able to follow\nthe whole process of matter falling into BHs. The distant observer could not\ndistinguish between a \"real\" BH and a \"frozen star\", until two such objects\nmerge together. It has been proposed that electromagnetic waves will be\nproduced when two \"frozen stars\" merge together, but not true when two \"real\"\nbare BHs merge together.

The main motivation behind this work is to\nobtain spatially-resolved information on an evolved giant star in order to\nunderstand the mass-loss processes at work in these objects. The system\nconsists of a low-luminosity white dwarf and a mass-losing, non-dusty M2 giant.\nThe ultraviolet observations follow the white dwarf continuum through periodic\ngradual occultations by the wind and chromosphere of the giant, providing a\nunique diagnosis of the circumstellar gas in absorption. Unocculted spectra\ndisplay high ionization features, such as the OVI resonance doublet which is\npresent as a variable (hourly time-scales), broad wind profile, which diagnose\nthe hot gas close to the dwarf component. Spectra observed at stages of partial\noccultation display a host of low-ionization, narrow, absorption lines, with\ntransitions observed from lower energy levels up to ~5eV above ground. This\nabsorption is due to chromospheric/wind material, with most lines due to\ntransitions of SiII, PII, NI, FeII and NiII, as well as heavily damped HI Lyman\nseries features. No molecular features are observed in the wind acceleration\nregion despite the sensitivity of FUSE to molecular hydrogen. From analysis of\nthe ultraviolet dataset, as well as optical data, we find that the dwarf\nradiation does not dominate the wind acceleration region of the giant, and that\nobserved thermal and dynamic wind properties are most likely representative of\nisolated red giants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Oct 2007 13:09:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-15"}

The inclusion of samples from deeper published surveys,\nsuch as the Chandra Deep Fields, allows us to span the lower Lx range of the\nXLF.

It allows for a full set of multi-Pomeron vertices, as well as\nincluding multichannel eikonal scattering. It describes the behaviour of the\nproton-proton total, sigma(total), and elastic dsigma(el)/dt, cross sections\ntogether with those for low and high mass proton dissociation. Although the\nmodel contains a comprehensive set of multi-Pomeron diagrams, it has a simple\npartonic interpretation. Including the more complicated multi-Pomeron vertices\nreduces the absorptive effects as compared to the predictions in which only the\ntriple-Pomeron vertex is considered. Tuning the model to describe the available\n`soft' data in the CERN ISR - Tevatron energy range, we predict the total,\nelastic, single- and double-diffractive dissociation cross sections at the LHC\nenergy. An inescapable consequence of including multichannel eikonal and\nmulti-Pomeron effects is that the total cross section is expected to be lower\nthan before: indeed, we find sigma(total) \\simeq 90 mb at the LHC energy. We\nalso present differential forms of the cross sections. In addition we calculate\nsoft diffractive central production.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Oct 2007 15:50:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2007 11:34:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2007 11:38:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
