Using our CSE algorithm, we reduce the additive\ncomplexities of cyclotomic fast Fourier transforms (CFFTs). Using a weighted\nsum of the numbers of multiplications and additions as a metric, our CFFTs\nachieve smaller total complexities than previously proposed CFFTs and other\nFFTs, requiring both fewer multiplications and fewer additions in many cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2007 08:13:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2007 18:09:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 May 2008 03:23:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 23 Oct 2008 06:18:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-23"}

For straight strings without small-scale\nstructure there are no signals. In the case of strings with small-scale\nstructure leading to a local gravitational attractive force towards the string,\nthere is a small signal, namely a preferential elliptical distortion of the\nshape of background galaxies in the direction corresponding to the projection\nof the string onto the sky. The signal can be statistically distinguished from\nthe signal produced by a linear distribution of black holes by employing an\nellipticity axis distribution statistic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2007 13:44:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-11"}

We study the variability of the Fe 6.4 KeV emission line from the Class\nI young stellar object Elias 29 in the Rho-Oph cloud. METHODS. We analysed the\ndata from Elias 29 collected by XMM during a nine-day, nearly continuous\nobservation of the Rho-Oph star-forming region (the Deep Rho-Oph X-ray\nObservation, named Droxo). The data were subdivided into six homogeneous time\nintervals, and the six resulting spectra were individually analysed. RESULTS.\nWe detect significant variability in the equivalent width of the Fe 6.4 keV\nemission line from Elias 29. The 6.4 keV line is absent during the first time\ninterval of observation and appears at its maximum strength during the second\ntime interval (90 ks after Elias 29 undergoes a strong flare). The X-ray\nthermal emission is unchanged between the two observation segments, while line\nvariability is present at a 99.9% confidence level. Given the significant line\nvariability in the absence of variations in the X-ray ionising continuum and\nthe weakness of the photoionising continuum from the star's thermal X-ray\nemission, we suggest that the fluorescence may be induced by collisional\nionisation from an (unseen) population of non-thermal electrons. We speculate\non the possibility that the electrons are accelerated in a reconnection event\nof a magnetically confined accretion loop, connecting the young star to its\ncircumstellar disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2007 08:10:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

To estimate the graph of conditional dependences of P_C, we\nintroduce a collection of candidate graphs and then select one of them by\nminimizing a penalized empirical risk. Our main result assess the performance\nof the procedure in a non-asymptotic setting. We pay a special attention to the\nmaximal degree D of the graphs that we can handle, which turns to be roughly\nn/(2 log p).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2007 15:36:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Apr 2008 04:25:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 2008 18:29:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-16"}
