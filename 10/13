Each\nnode in the network is located on a point in a two dimensional grid, and\nwhenever a node sends a message, all awake nodes within distance r receive the\nmessage. In the broadcast problem, some node wants to successfully send a\nmessage to all other nodes in the network even when up to a 1/2 fraction of the\nnodes within every neighborhood can be deleted by an adversary. The set of\ndeleted nodes is carefully chosen by the adversary to foil our algorithm and\nmoreover, the set of deleted nodes may change periodically. This models\nworst-case behavior due to mobile nodes, static nodes losing power or simply\nsome points in the grid being unoccupied. A trivial solution requires each node\nin the network to be awake roughly 1/2 the time, and a trivial lower bound\nshows that each node must be awake for at least a 1/n fraction of the time. Our\nfirst result is an algorithm that requires each node to be awake for only a\n1/sqrt(n) fraction of the time in expectation. Our algorithm achieves this\nwhile ensuring correctness with probability 1, and keeping optimal values for\nother resource costs such as latency and number of messages sent. We give a\nlower-bound that shows that this reduction in power consumption is\nasymptotically optimal when latency and number of messages sent must be\noptimal. If we can increase the latency and messages sent by only a log*n\nfactor we give a Las Vegas algorithm that requires each node to be awake for\nonly a (log*n)/n expected fraction of the time; we give a lower-bound showing\nthat this second algorithm is near optimal.

The key ideas instrumental in\nconstructing these pairings are the derived functor interpretation of\nHopf-cyclic and equivariant cyclic (co)homology, and the Yoneda interpretation\nof Ext-groups. As a special case of one of these pairings, we recover the\nConnes-Moscovici characteristic map in Hopf-cyclic cohomology. We also prove\nthat this particular pairing, along with few others, would stay the same if we\nreplace the derived category of (co)cyclic modules with the homotopy category\nof (special) towers of $X$-complexes, or the derived category of mixed\ncomplexes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Oct 2007 22:27:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-16"}

Key results are\nthat both the solar and stellar data are consistent with a common scaling law\nof EM_p ~ T_p^4.7, but the stellar flares exhibit ~250 times higher emission\nmeasures (at the same flare peak temperature). For solar flares we observe also\nsystematic trends for the flare length scale L(T_p) ~ T_p^0.9 and the flare\nduration t_F(T_p) ~ T_p^0.9 as a function of the flare peak temperature.

Pitjeva in a global fit of almost one century of\ndata with the EPM2004 ephemerides, in order to put on the test the expression\nfor the perihelion precession induced by an uniform cosmological constant\nLambda in the framework of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (or Kottler) space-time.\nWe compare such an extra-rate to the estimated corrections to the planetary\nperihelion precessions by taking their ratio for different pairs of planets\ninstead of using one perihelion at a time for each planet separately, as done\nso far in literature. The answer is neatly negative, even by further re-scaling\nby a factor 10 (and even 100 for Saturn) the errors in the estimated\nextra-precessions of the perihelia released by Pitjeva. Our conclusions hold\nalso for any other metric perturbation having the same dependence on the\nspatial coordinates, as those induced by other general relativistic\ncosmological scenarios and by many modified models of gravity.
