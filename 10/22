Reshaping the beam to a flatter wider profile which probes more of\nthe mirror surface reduces this noise. The \"Mesa\" beam shape has been proposed\nfor this purpose and was subsequently generalized to a family of hyperboloidal\nbeams with two parameters: twist angle alpha and beam width D. Varying alpha\nallows a continuous transition from the nearly-flat to the nearly-concentric\nMesa beam configurations. We analytically prove that in the limit of infinite D\nhyperboloidal beams become Gaussians. The Advanced LIGO diffraction loss design\nconstraint is 1 ppm per bounce. In the past the diffraction loss has often been\ncalculated using the clipping approximation that, in general, underestimates\nthe diffraction loss. We develop a code using pseudo-spectral methods to\ncompute the diffraction loss directly from the propagator. We find that the\ndiffraction loss is not a strictly monotonic function of beam width, but has\nlocal minima that occur due to finite mirror effects and leads to natural\nchoices of D. For the Mesa beam a local minimum occurs at D = 10.67 cm and\nleads to a diffraction loss of 1.4 ppm. We find that if one requires a\ndiffraction loss of strictly 1 ppm, the alpha = 0.91 pi hyperboloidal beam is\noptimal, leading to the coating thermal noise being lower by about 10% than for\na Mesa beam while other types of thermal noise decrease as well. We then\ndevelop an iterative process that reconstructs the mirror to specifically\naccount for finite mirror effects. This allows us to increase the D parameter\nand lower the coating noise by about 30% compared to the original Mesa\nconfiguration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Oct 2007 21:40:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Dec 2007 21:19:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Thus, any subset of nodes is allowed to\ntry faking its position. As in previous approaches, our protocol is based on\ndistance evaluation techniques developed for WSN. On the positive side, we show\nthat when the received signal strength (RSS) technique is used, our protocol\nhandles at most $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor-2$ faking sensors.

We introduce a new method for removing host galaxy contamination in our\nspectra, exploiting the comprehensive photometric coverage of the SNLS SNe and\ntheir host galaxies, thereby providing the first quantitative view of the UV\nspectral properties of a large sample of distant SNe Ia. Although the mean SN\nIa spectrum has not evolved significantly over the past 40% of cosmic history,\nprecise evolutionary constraints are limited by the absence of a comparable\nsample of high quality local spectra.

Although\nprogenitor metallicity may drive some of these trends, the variations we see\nare much larger than predicted in recent models and do not follow expected\npatterns.

We consider a class of two-stage mechanisms which a)\nsend information to allow the reconstruction of the sensor's samples within\nsufficient accuracy, and then b) use these reconstructions to estimate the\nentire field. To implement the first stage, the heavy correlation between the\nsensor samples suggests the use of distributed coding schemes to reduce the\ntotal rate. We demonstrate the existence of a distributed block coding scheme\nthat achieves, for a given fidelity criterion for the reconstruction of the\nfield, a total information rate that is bounded by a constant, independent of\nthe number $N$ of sensors. The constant in general depends on the\nautocorrelation function of the field and the desired distortion criterion for\nthe sensor samples.

While this scheme operates at a rate that\nis greater than the rate achievable through distributed coding and entails\ngreater delay in reconstruction, its simplicity makes it attractive for\nimplementation in sensor networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2007 04:14:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-23"}

It is found that the\nscattering transfers the low-frequency photons to high harmonics of the\ngyrofrequency, into the range of the synchrotron emission of the electron. The\ntotal scattering cross-section appears much larger than that for the particle\nat rest. The problem studied is directly applicable to the radio wave\nscattering in the magnetosphere of a pulsar.

By coupling it with the well known relativistic formula defining the\nrelative velocity of the mutually moving apart source and receiver of the\nsignal, the explicit analytic expression for the Hubble law is obtained. The\nconnection between acceleration and the Hubble constant follows therefrom\nimmediately. The expression for the conformal time deformation in the small\ntime limit leads to the quadratic time nonlinearity. Being applied to describe\nthe location-type experiments, this predicts the existence of the uniformly\nchanging blue-shifted frequency drift. Phenomenon of the Pioneer Anomaly (PA)\nis treated as the first of such a kind of effects discovered experimentally.\nThe obtained formulae reproduce the PA experimental data.

Previous studies of the\nwhite dwarf component yielded a cooling time of ~4 Gyr. Although it has not\nbeen pointed out before explicitly, this result is 6 times larger than the age\nof the Hyades cluster, giving rise to an apparent conflict between the physics\nof white dwarfs and cluster main-sequence fitting. We investigate whether this\nsystem belongs to the Hyades cluster and, accordingly, give a plausible\nexplanation to the nature of the white dwarf member. From kinematic and\nchemical composition considerations we believe that the system was a former\nmember of the Hyades cluster and therefore has an evolutionary link with it.\nHowever, the evidence is not conclusive. With regards to the nature of the\nwhite dwarf component, we find that two core compositions (C/O and Fe) are\ncompatible with the observed effective temperature and radius. These\ncompositions yield very different cooling times of ~4 Gyr and ~1 Gyr,\nrespectively. We distinguish two posssible scenarios. If the pair does not\nbelong to the Hyades cluster but only to the Hyades stream, this would indicate\nthat such stream contains rather old objects and definitely not coeval with the\ncluster. This has interesting consequences for Galactic dynamics. On the\ncontrary, if the white dwarf has an Fe core, it will have a cooling time\ncompatible with the Hyades age.

Here we\napply PCA to the optical data of Planetary Nebulae (PNe) with the aim of\nextracting information about their morphological differences. Preliminary\nanalysis of a sample of 55 PNe with known abundances and morphology shows that\nthe second component (PC2), which results from a relation produced by the\nparameters log(N/O), initial and final mass of PNe, is depending on the\nmorphology of PNe. It has been found that when log(N/O) < -0.18 the PNe's\nnitrogen is low independently on the oxygen abundance for either Bipolar (B),\nElliptical (E) or Round (R) PNe. An interesting result is that both E and R PNe\nhave log(N/O) < 0 while only B PNe show negative and positive values.\nConsequently, B PNe are expected to have higher nitrogen values than the E and\nR PNe. Following that and a second sample of 35 PNe, n_{e} is also found to be\nhigher in B PNe. Also, in all PNe morphologies PC2 appears to have a minimum at\n0.89 and PNe's initial mass at 2.6 solar masses. 5-D diagrams between PCAs\ncomponents and physical parameters are also presented. More results will follow\nwhile simple models will be applied in order to try to give a physical meaning\nto the components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2007 11:28:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-23"}

In this paper, we address the biases introduced by this\nprocedure by comparing the surface mass densities of actual N-body haloes\nagainst the widely used analytical model suggested by Navarro, Frenk and White\n(1996) (NFW).\n  We conduct our analysis in the redshift range of 0.0 - 1.5. In cluster sized\nhaloes, we find that triaxiality can cause scatter in the surface mass density\nof the haloes up to sigma_+ = +60% and sigma_- = -70%, where the 1-sigma limits\nare relative to the analytical NFW model given value. Subhaloes can increase\nthis scatter to sigma_+ = +70% and sigma_- = -80%. In galaxy sized haloes, the\ntriaxial scatter can be as high as sigma_+ = +80% and sigma_- = -70%, and with\nsubhaloes the values can change to sigma_+ = +40% and sigma_- = -80%.\n  We present an analytical model for the surface mass density scatter as a\nfunction of distance to the halo centre, halo redshift and halo mass.

The spectral results are based on the\nsystematic analysis of all INTEGRAL observations covering the source position\nperformed between February 2003 and October 2006. SAXJ1712.6-3739 did not shows\nany flux variation along this period as well as compared to previous BeppoSAX\nobservation. Hence, to better constrain the physical parameters we combined\nboth instrument data. Long INTEGRAL monitoring reveals, for the first time,\nthat this X-ray burster is a weak persistent source, displaying a X-ray\nspectrum extended to high energy and spending most of the time in a low\nluminosity hard state. The broad-band spectrum is well modeled with a simple\nComptonized model with a seed photons temperature of ~0.5keV and an electron\ntemperature of ~24keV. The low mass accretion rate (~2x10^{-10} Msun/yr), the\nlong bursts recurrence time, the small sizes of the region emitting the seed\nphotons consisting with the inner disk radius and the high luminosity ratio in\nthe 40-100keV and 20-40keV band, are all features common to the Ultra Compact\nsource class.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2007 12:45:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The generalization of this unification model to the higher\nluminosity AGNs that are the quasars remains a key question. The recent\ndetection of Type 2 Radio-Quiet quasars seems to support such an extension. We\npropose to further test this scenario.\n  On the basis of a compilation of quasar host galaxy position angles\nconsisting of previously published data and of new measurements performed using\nHST Archive images, we investigate the possible existence of a correlation\nbetween the linear polarization position angle and the host galaxy/extended\nemission position angle of quasars.\n  We find that the orientation of the rest-frame UV/blue extended emission is\ncorrelated to the direction of the quasar polarization. For Type 1 quasars, the\npolarization is aligned with the extended UV/blue emission while these two\nquantities are perpendicular in Type 2 objects. This result is independent of\nthe quasar radio-loudness. We interpret this (anti-)alignment effect in terms\nof scattering in a two-component polar+equatorial model which applies to both\nType 1 and Type 2 objects. Moreover the orientation of the polarization -and\nthen of the UV/blue scattered light- does not appear correlated to the major\naxis of the stellar component of the host galaxy measured from near-IR images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2007 13:33:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In particular, we consider ``the\nminimal Gromov-Witten ring'', i. e. a commutative algebra with generators and\nrelations of the form used in the Gromov-Witten theory of Fano variety (of\nunspecified dimension). Gromov-Witten theory of any quantum minimal variety is\na homomorphism of this ring to $\\mathbb C$. We prove the Abstract\nReconstruction Theorem which states the particular isomorphism of this ring\nwith a free commutative ring generated by ``prime two-pointed invariants''. We\nalso find the solutions of the differential equations of type DN for a Fano\nvariety of dimension N in terms of generating series of one-pointed\nGromov-Witten invariants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2007 15:39:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-07"}

The emitted flux becomes\nseveral times super-Eddington at the Hard Apex and Horizontal Branch and we\nsuggest that the inner accretion disk is disrupted by this and that part of the\naccretion flow is diverted vertically. This position on the Z-track is exactly\nthe position where radio emission is detected showing the presence of jets. We\nthus propose that high radiation pressure is a necessary condition for the\nlaunching of jets. We also show that flaring must consist of unstable nuclear\nburning and that the mass accretion rate per unit emitting area of the neutron\nstar mdot at the onset of flaring agrees well with the critical theoretical\nvalue at which burning becomes unstable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2007 15:59:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-23"}
