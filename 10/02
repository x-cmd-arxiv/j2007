We find no statistically-significant evidence for\nradio emission from the central region for any of the three clusters. NGC6266\nshows a 2-sigma detection.

Using both analytic models\nand \"semi-numeric\" simulations, we show that the \"picket-fence\" absorption\ntypical in reionization models introduces both scatter and a systematic bias to\nthe measurement of x_H. In particular, we show that simple fits to the damping\nwing tend to overestimate the true neutral fraction in a partially ionized\nuniverse, with a fractional error of ~ 30% near the middle of reionization.\nThis bias is generic to any inhomogeneous model. However, the bias is reduced\nand can even underestimate x_H if the observational sample only probes a subset\nof the entire halo population, such as quasars with large HII regions. We also\nfind that the damping wing absorption profile is generally steeper than one\nwould naively expect in a homogeneously ionized universe. The profile steepens\nand the sightline-to-sightline scatter increases as reionization progresses. Of\ncourse, the bias and scatter also depend on x_H and so can, at least in\nprinciple, be used to constrain it.

Simulations of galaxy formation reproduce\nthese trends owing to the generic dominance of smooth and steady cold accretion\nin these systems. In contrast, the amplitude of the M*-SFR relation evolves\nmarkedly differently than in models. Stated in terms of a star formation\nactivity parameter alpha=(M*/SFR)/(t_H-1 Gyr), models predict a constant\nalpha~1 out to redshifts z=4+, while the observed M*-SFR relation indicates\nthat alpha increases by X3 from z~2 until today.

Simulations of hierarchical structure formation in LCDM cosmologies\npredict that the dark matter halo of a galaxy like the Milky Way contains\nhundreds of subhalos with masses of ~10^8 solar masses and greater, and it has\nbeen suggested that the existence of coherent tidal streams is incompatible\nwith the expected abundance of substructure. We investigate the effects of dark\nmatter substructure on tidal streams by simulating the disruption of a\nself-gravitating satellite on a wide range of orbits in different host models\nboth with and without substructure. We find that the halo shape and the\nspecific orbital path more strongly determine the overall degree of disruption\nof the satellite than does the presence or absence of substructure, i.e., the\nchanges in the large-scale properties of the tidal debris due to substructure\nare small compared to variations in the debris from different orbits in a\nsmooth potential. Substructure typically leads to an increase in the degree of\nclumpiness of the tidal debris in sky projection, and in some cases a more\ncompact distribution in line-of-sight velocity. Substructure also leads to\ndifferences in the location of sections of debris compared to the results of\nthe smooth halo model, which may have important implications for the\ninterpretation of observed tidal streams. A unique signature of the presence of\nsubstructure in the halo which may be detectable by upcoming surveys is\nidentified.

I will review\nthe standard theory of PWNe, their evolution, and the current status in the\nmodeling of their emission properties, in particular I will show that our\nevolutionary models are able to describe the observations, and that the X-ray\nemission can now be reproduced with sufficient accuracy, to the point that we\ncan use these nebulae to investigate fundamental issues as the properties of\nrelativistic outflows and particle acceleration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2007 22:27:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

Specifically, we\nstudy a class of half-filled, Hubbard-like models for spinless fermions with\n(complex) random hopping and short-ranged interactions on bipartite lattices,\nin d > 1. In a given realization, the hopping disorder breaks time reversal\ninvariance, but preserves the special ``nesting'' symmetry responsible for the\ncharge density wave instability of the ballistic Fermi liquid. This disorder\nmay arise, e.g., from the application of a random magnetic field to the\notherwise clean model. We derive a low energy effective field theory\ndescription for this class of disordered, interacting fermion systems, which\ntakes the form of a Finkel'stein non-linear sigma model [A. M.

Both schemes reveal\ninteresting symmetries of scaling, which are reminiscent of the relational\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics and also suggest that the fundamental\nspatial scale (area gap) may give rise to a temporal scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2007 00:32:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2007 23:20:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Out of equilibrium we\ndemonstrate that the one-shot G0W0 approximation can produce severe errors, in\nparticular at high bias. Finally, we consider a benzene molecule between\nfeatureless leads. It is found that the molecule's HOMO-LUMO gap as calculated\nin GW is significantly reduced as the coupling to the leads is increased,\nreflecting the more efficient screening in the strongly coupled junction. For\nthe IV characteristics of the junction we find that HF and G0W0[G_HF] yield\nresults closer to GW than does DFT and G0W0[G_DFT]. This is explained in terms\nof self-interaction effects and life-time reduction due to electron-electron\ninteractions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2007 10:00:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Apr 2008 07:50:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Excitation of low frequency optical plasmons in the\nmetallic nanotube is responsible for the peak known as the Breit-Wigner-Fano\n(BWF) line shape in the G-band Raman spectra. In a filled nanotube there is an\nadditional peak due to excitation of the phonon of the filling atom or\nmolecule. Positions, shapes and relative strengths of these Raman peaks depend\non the phonon frequencies of the nanotube and that of the filling atoms, and\nstrengths and forms of the plasmon-phonon and phonon-phonon interactions. For\nexample, filling atoms with phonon frequency close to the RBM frequency of the\nnanotube may broaden and lower the RBM Raman peak to such an extent that it may\nbecome barely visible. Hybridization between the G-bands and the filling atom\nphonon is also strong when these two frequencies are close to each other and it\nhas important effects on the G-band and the BWF line shapes.

Raman spectra of semiconducting unfilled and filled nanotubes have\nsimilar behavior as those of metallic nanotubes except that normally they have\nLorentzian line shapes and do not show a BWF line shape. However, if a\nsemiconducting nanotube is filled with donor atoms, it is predicted that the\nBWF type line shape may be observed near the RBM, or the G-band or the filling\natom Raman peak.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2007 13:23:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Velocity components perpendicular to the magnetic\nfield are necessary both to compute these transport rates and to derive model\nboundary conditions. Here, we discuss some possible approaches to estimating\nperpendicular flows from magnetograms. Since Doppler shifts contain\ncontributions from flows parallel to the magnetic field, perpendicular\nvelocities are not generally recoverable from Doppler shifts alone. The\ninduction equation's vertical component relates evolution in $B_z$ to the\nperpendicular flow field, but has a finite null space, meaning some ``null''\nflows, e.g., motions along contours of normal field, do not affect $B_z$.\nConsequently, additional information is required to accurately specify the\nperpendicular flow field. Tracking methods, which analyze $\\partial_t B_z$ in a\nneighborhood, have a long heritage, but other approaches have recently been\ndeveloped. In a recent paper, several such techniques were tested using\nsynthetic magnetograms from MHD simulations. Here, we use the same test data to\ncharacterize: 1) the ability of the induction equation's normal component, by\nitself, to estimate flows; and 2) a tracking method's ability to recover flow\ncomponents that are perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}$ and parallel to contours of\n$B_z$.

In this paper, we present CO\nspectra acquired shortly after the luminosity of the source returned to its\npre-outburst level (2006 February) and roughly one year later (2006 December\nand 2007 February). The spectrum taken in 2006 February revealed blue-shifted\nCO absorption lines superimposed on the previously observed CO emission lines.\nThe projected velocity, column density, and temperature of this outflowing gas\nwas 30 km/s, 3^{+2}_{-1}E18 cm^{-2$, and 700^{+300}_{-100} K, respectively. The\nabsorption lines were not observed in the 2006 December and 2007 February data,\nand so their strengths must have decreased in the interim by a factor of 9 or\nmore. We discuss three mechanisms that could give rise to this unusual outflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2007 15:57:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
