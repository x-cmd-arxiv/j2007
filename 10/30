About 80% of bulges in unbarred lenticular and\nearly-to-intermediate spiral galaxies are not oblate but triaxial ellipsoids.\nTheir mean axial ratio in the equatorial plane is <B/A> = 0.85. There is not\nsignificant dependence of their PDF on morphology, light concentration, and\nluminosity. The interplay between bulge and disk parameters favors scenarios in\nwhich bulges assembled from mergers and/or grew over long times through disk\nsecular evolution. But all these mechanisms have to be tested against the\nderived distribution of bulge intrinsic ellipticities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2007 16:01:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Nov 2007 18:14:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The decision whether a secondary detonation is triggered in the\nwhite dwarf's core or not is made based on criteria given in the literature. In\na parameter study involving different initial flame geometries for He-shell\nmasses of 0.2 and 0.1 M_sun, we find that a secondary detonation ignition is a\nvery robust process. Converging shock waves originating from the detonation in\nthe He shell generate the conditions for a detonation near the center of the\nwhite dwarf in most of the cases considered. Finally, we follow the complete\nevolution of three selected models with 0.2 M_sun of He through the\nC/O-detonation phase and obtain nickel-masses of about 0.40 to 0.45 M_sun.\nAlthough we have not done a complete scan of the possible parameter space, our\nresults show that sub-Chandrasekhar models are not good candidates for normal\nor sub-luminous type Ia supernovae. The chemical composition of the ejecta\nfeatures significant amounts of nickel in the outer layers at high expansion\nvelocities, which is inconsistent with near-maximum spectra.

It is found that the critical temperature for the phase\ntransition is closer to lattice results than the one obtained with the\nconventional regularization, and the restoration of chiral and axial\nsymmetries, signaled by the behavior of several observables, occurs\nsimultaneously and at a higher temperature. The restoration of the axial\nsymmetry appears as a natural consequence of the full recovering of the chiral\nsymmetry that was dynamically broken. By using an additional ansatz that\nsimulates instanton suppression effects, by means of a convenient temperature\ndependence of the anomaly coefficient, we found that the restoration of U(2)\nsymmetry is shifted to lower values, but the dominant effect at high\ntemperatures comes from the new regularization that enhances the decrease of\nquark condensates, especially in the strange sector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2007 17:48:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2008 08:12:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

However, for a certain type of (sufficiently) good codes an efficient\ndecoding algorithm with near optimal performance exists. These codes are\ndefined via a combination of constituent codes with low complexity trellis\nrepresentations. Their decoding algorithm is an instance of (loopy) belief\npropagation and is based on an iterative transfer of constituent beliefs. The\nbeliefs are thereby given by the symbol probabilities computed in the\nconstituent trellises. Even though weak constituent codes are employed close to\noptimal performance is obtained, i.e., the encoder/decoder pair (almost)\nachieves the information theoretic capacity. However, (loopy) belief\npropagation only performs well for a rather specific set of codes, which limits\nits applicability.\n  In this paper a generalisation of iterative decoding is presented. It is\nproposed to transfer more values than just the constituent beliefs. This is\nachieved by the transfer of beliefs obtained by independently investigating\nparts of the code space. This leads to the concept of discriminators, which are\nused to improve the decoder resolution within certain areas and defines\ndiscriminated symbol beliefs. It is shown that these beliefs approximate the\noverall symbol probabilities. This leads to an iteration rule that (below\nchannel capacity) typically only admits the solution of the overall decoding\nproblem. Via a Gauss approximation a low complexity version of this algorithm\nis derived. Moreover, the approach may then be applied to a wide range of\nchannel maps without significant complexity increase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2007 19:01:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-30"}

We use simulated galaxy catalogs constructed to reproduce observed\ngalaxy luminosity functions from GOODS, and derive photometric redshifts using\na template fitting method. By using a catalog that resembles real data, we can\nestimate the expected number density of galaxies for which photometric\nredshifts can be derived.

The accuracy of the photometric redshifts is\nalso dependent on galaxy type, with smaller scatter for earlier type galaxies.\nComparing results using different filter sets, we find that including the\nU-band is important for decreasing the fraction of outliers, i.e.,\n``catastrophic failures''. Using broad overlapping filters with resolution\n~4gives better photometric redshifts compared to narrower filters (resolution\n>~5) with the same integration time.

For short range\nscreening the charge variance in a circular region with radius $R$ grows\nlinearly with $R$, instead of with $R^{2}$ as expected in the absence of\nscreening; for long range screening it grows faster than $R$: for a field whose\nautocorrelation function is the zero order Bessel function J_{0}, the charge\nvariance grows as R ln R$. A J_{0} correlation function is not attainable in\npractice, but we show how to generate an optical field whose correlation\nfunction closely approximates this form. The charge variance can be measured by\ncounting positive and negative singularities inside the region A, or more\neasily by counting signed zero crossings on the perimeter of A. \\For the first\nmethod the charge variance is calculated by integration over the charge\ncorrelation function C(r), for the second by integration over the zero crossing\ncorrelation function Gamma(r).

We constrain the lens model using 8 previously known multiply\nimaged systems, of which 7 have spectroscopically confirmed redshifts. In\naddition, we propose five candidate multiply imaged systems and estimate their\nredshifts using our mass model. The model parameters are optimized in the\nsource plane by a bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain as implemented in the the\npublicly available software Lenstool. We find rms=0.\"12 for the scatter of the\nsources in the source plane, which translates into rms=1.\"49 between the\npredicted and measured image positions in the image plane. We find that the\nprojected mass distribution of Abell 2218 is bimodal, which is supported by an\nanalysis of the light distribution. We also find evidence for two structures in\nvelocity space, separated by ~1000 km/s, corresponding to the two large scale\ndark matter clumps. We find that the lensing constraints can not be well\nreproduced using only dark matter halos associated with the cluster galaxies,\nbut that the dark matter is required to be smoothly distributed in large scale\nhalos. At 100\" the enclosed projected mass is 3.8e14 solar masses. At that\nradius, the large scale halos contribute ~85% of the mass. We find that the\nmodel is not very sensitive to the fainter galaxy sized halos, unless they\nlocally perturb a given multiply imaged system. Therefore, dark galaxy sized\nsubstructure can be reliably constrained only if it locally perturbs one of the\nsystems. In an appendix we give a self-contained description of the parametric\nprofile we use, the dual pseudo isothermal elliptical mass distribution (dPIE).\nThis profile is a two component pseudo isothermal mass distribution (PIEMD)\nwith both a core radii and a scale radii.

For a field star the differences in its\nrelative coordinate positions of two epochs will be accumulated. For a cluster\nstar, on the contrary, the changes in relative positions of cluster members at\nt_1 and t_2 will be very small.

The present paper is a study on what can be\nachieved for infinite transition systems under these premises. As models we\nconsider products of infinite transition systems with different synchronization\nconstraints. We introduce finitely synchronized transition systems, i.e.\nproduct systems which contain only finitely many (parameterized) synchronized\ntransitions, and show that the decidability of FO(R), first-order logic\nextended by reachability predicates, of the product system can be reduced to\nthe decidability of FO(R) of the components. This result is optimal in the\nfollowing sense: (1) If we allow semifinite synchronization, i.e. just in one\ncomponent infinitely many transitions are synchronized, the FO(R)-theory of the\nproduct system is in general undecidable. (2) We cannot extend the expressive\npower of the logic under consideration. Already a weak extension of first-order\nlogic with transitive closure, where we restrict the transitive closure\noperators to arity one and nesting depth two, is undecidable for an\nasynchronous (and hence finitely synchronized) product, namely for the infinite\ngrid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2007 14:39:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2007 11:46:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-01"}

Optical/near\ninfrared counterparts are found for ~78% (66/85) of the radio sources in the\nregion covered by the deep multi-colour imaging, and for 56 of these reliable\nestimates of the redshift and type are derived. We find that many of the\nsources with flat radio spectra are characterised by high radio-to-optical\nratios (R>1000), typical of classical powerful radio galaxies and quasars.\nFlat-spectrum sources with low R values are preferentially identified with\nearly type galaxies, where the radio emission is most probably triggered by\nlow-luminosity active galactic nuclei. Considering both early type galaxies and\nquasars as sources with an active nucleus, such sources largely dominate our\nsample (78%). Flat-spectrum sources associated with early type galaxies are\nquite compact (d<10-30 kpc), suggesting core-dominated radio emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2007 15:28:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In the initial (in general, nonlinear) Langevin\nequations, self-averaging over continuous fragments of a macromolecule\nnaturally defines a linear term for the tagged chain, and this term differs\nfrom the entropy term of the classical Rouse model only by the numerical\ncoefficient. According to the inertia-free approximation, the initial decay\nrates of correlation functions for the normal modes are described by the Rouse\nmodel independently of the character of fluctuations of the vector connecting\nthe ends of the Kuhn segment. This statement is valid for any moment if the\ninitial Langevin equations are treated in terms of the approximation of dynamic\nself-consistency. Simulation of the Fraenkel chains by the method of Brownian\ndynamics shows that decay of autocorrelation functions of shortwave normal\nmodes is fairly described by the linearized equations for a given model of a\nchain and that the Rouse equation can be used for the longwave modes. The\nresults of this study make it possible to explain a marked difference between\nthe lengths of the Kuhn and Rouse segments that is estimated from static and\ndynamic experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2007 15:34:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2010 17:23:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-27"}

Their ratio defines the medium-induced\npopulation of the modes of the transverse electromagnetic field and so\ngeneralizes Planck's law to an arbitrarily absorbing and dispersing medium in a\nnonequilibrium steady state.
