The chain is assumed\nweakly inhomogeneous. We look for small amplitude discrete breathers. The\nproblem is reformulated as a nonautonomous recurrence in a space of\ntime-periodic functions, where the dynamics is considered along the discrete\nspatial coordinate. We show that small amplitude oscillations are determined by\nfinite-dimensional nonautonomous mappings, whose dimension depends on the\nsolutions frequency. We consider the case of two-dimensional reduced mappings,\nwhich occurs for frequencies close to the edges of the phonon band. For an\nhomogeneous chain, the reduced map is autonomous and reversible, and\nbifurcations of reversible homoclinics or heteroclinic solutions are found for\nappropriate parameter values. These orbits correspond respectively to discrete\nbreathers, or dark breathers superposed on a spatially extended standing wave.\nBreather existence is shown in some cases for any value of the coupling\nconstant, which generalizes an existence result obtained by MacKay and Aubry at\nsmall coupling. For an inhomogeneous chain the study of the nonautonomous\nreduced map is in general far more involved. For the principal part of the\nreduced recurrence, using the assumption of weak inhomogeneity, we show that\nhomoclinics to 0 exist when the image of the unstable manifold under a linear\ntransformation intersects the stable manifold.

Inflation, on the other hand,\nconstitutes another crucial ingredient, which seems necessary to solve other\ncosmological conundrums and provides the primeval quantum seeds for structure\nformation. One may wonder if there is any deep relationship between these two\nparadigms. In this work, we suggest that the existence of the DE in the present\nUniverse could be linked to the quantum field theoretical mechanism that may\nhave triggered primordial inflation in the early Universe. This mechanism,\nbased on quantum conformal symmetry, induces a logarithmic,\nasymptotically-free, running of the gravitational coupling. If this evolution\npersists in the present Universe, and if matter is conserved, the general\ncovariance of Einstein's equations demands the existence of dynamical DE in the\nform of a running cosmological term whose variation follows a power law of the\nredshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2007 21:15:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2008 19:54:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

According to a thermodynamic and structural consensus principle,\nmiRBase is categorized by conservation subgroups, which imply various\nfunctions.

Here\nwe extend the discussion to the power spectrum and also to redshift space. In\nreal space, pairs oriented close to the LOS direction are not protected against\nnonlinearity even if the pair separation is large; this is because nonlinear\nfluctuations can enter through gravitational lensing at a small transverse\nseparation (or i.e. impact parameter). The situation in Fourier space is\ndifferent: by focusing on a small wavenumber $k$, as is usually done, linearity\nis guaranteed because both the LOS and transverse wavenumbers must be small.\nThis is why magnification distortion of the galaxy correlation appears less\nsevere in Fourier space. Nonetheless, the effect is non-negligible, especially\nfor the transverse Fourier modes, and should be taken into account in\ninterpreting precision measurements of the galaxy power spectrum, for instance\nthose that focus on the baryon oscillations. The lensing induced anisotropy of\nthe power spectrum has a shape that is distinct from the more well known\nredshift space anisotropies due to peculiar motions and the Alcock-Paczynski\neffect. The lensing anisotropy is highly localized in Fourier space while\nredshift space distortions are more spread out.

To compete, time-dependent seismicity models are\ncalibrated on earthquake catalog data. But catalogs contain much observational\nuncertainty. We study the impact of magnitude uncertainties on rate estimates\nin clustering models, on their forecasts and on their evaluation by CSEP's\nconsistency tests. First, we quantify magnitude uncertainties. We find that\nmagnitude uncertainty is more heavy-tailed than a Gaussian, such as a\ndouble-sided exponential distribution, with scale parameter nu_c=0.1 - 0.3.\nSecond, we study the impact of such noise on the forecasts of a simple\nclustering model which captures the main ingredients of popular short term\nmodels. We prove that the deviations of noisy forecasts from an exact forecast\nare power law distributed in the tail with exponent alpha=1/(a*nu_c), where a\nis the exponent of the productivity law of aftershocks. We further prove that\nthe typical scale of the fluctuations remains sensitively dependent on the\nspecific catalog. Third, we study how noisy forecasts are evaluated in CSEP\nconsistency tests. Noisy forecasts are rejected more frequently than expected\nfor a given confidence limit. The Poisson assumption of the consistency tests\nis inadequate for short-term forecast evaluations. To capture the\nidiosyncrasies of each model together with any propagating uncertainties, the\nforecasts need to specify the entire likelihood distribution of seismic rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2007 07:40:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We delineate here the\ncharacteristics of an 'ideal' instrument for the search of GRBs at z>6-10. We\nfind that the detection of these objects requires soft band detectors with a\nhigh sensitivity and moderately large FOV. In the light of these results, we\ncompare available and planned GRB missions, deriving conservative predictions\non the number of high-z GRBs detectable by these instruments along with the\nmaximum accessible redshift. We show that the Swift satellite will be able to\ndetect various GRBs at z>6, and likely at z>10 if the trigger threshold is\ndecreased by a factor of ~2. Furthermore, we find that INTEGRAL and GLAST are\nnot the best tool to detect bursts at z>6: the former being limited by the\nsmall FOV, and the latter by its hard energy band and relatively low\nsensitivity. Finally, future missions (SVOM, EDGE, but in particular EXIST)\nwill provide a good sample of GRBs at z>6 in a few years of operation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2007 15:22:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In principle, broad, ``non-radiative'' Ly$\\alpha$ from SNRs in young\ngalaxies can be directly observed in the optical range of wavelengths. However,\nby taking into consideration the different rates between core collapse and\nthermonuclear supernovae, as well as the duration we expect to observe such\nLy$\\alpha$ emission from SNRs, we expect their contribution to the total\nLy$\\alpha$ luminosity from $z \\sim 3$ to 5 galaxies to be negligibly small\n($\\sim 0.001 %$), compared to the radiative shock mechanism described by Shull\n& Silk (1979).

Treatment of voice abnormalities\nwould benefit from an improved understanding between the pathology and the\nresulting oscillation pattern which motivates physical vocal folds modelling.\nThe current study applies a theoretical vocal folds model to vocal folds\npathologies. The theoretical vocal folds model is validated using an\nexperimental set-up simulating the human phonatory apparatus. It consists in a\npressure reservoir, a self-oscillating latex replica of the vocal folds and an\nacoustical resonator. The effects of pathologies are simulated by modifying the\nreplica's geometry, elasticity, and homogeneity under controlled experimental\nconditions.
