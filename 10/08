For telescopes using coronagraphs to isolate the light from\nthe planet, each doubling of telescope diameter will increase the available\nsample of stars by an order of magnitude, indicating a high scientific return\nif the technical difficulties of constructing very large space telescopes can\nbe overcome. For telescopes detecting atmospheric signatures of transiting\nplanets, the sample size increases only linearly with diameter, and the\navailable samples are probably too small to guarantee detection of life-bearing\nplanets. Using samples of nearby stars suitable for exoplanet searches, this\npaper shows that the demands of searching for life with either technique will\nrequire large telescopes, with diameters of order 10m or larger in space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Oct 2007 21:34:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Oct 2007 00:24:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 29 Mar 2008 17:24:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

For each active galaxy, two inactive control\ngalaxies were selected by matching redshift, absolute magnitude, inclination,\nand radius. The sample of inactive galaxies naturally divides into a red and a\nblue sequence, while the vast majority of AGN hosts occur along the red\nsequence. In terms of H-alpha equivalent width, the population of composite\ngalaxies peaks in the valley between the two modes, suggesting a transition\npopulation.

The launch of Herschel\nwith on board HIFI and PACS allow to probe the behaviour of multiple water\nlines with unprecedented sensitivity and resolution. Aims: we investigate the\ndiagnostic value of specific water transitions in high-mass star-forming\nregions. As a test case, we apply our models to the AFGL2591 region. Results:\nin general, for models with a constant water abundance, the ground state lines,\ni.e., 1_(10)-1_(01), 1_(11)-0_(00), and 2_(12)-1_(01), are predicted in\nabsorption, all the others in emission. This behaviour changes for models with\na water abundance jump profile in that the line profiles for jumps by a factor\nof ~10-100 are similar to the line shapes in the constant abundance models,\nwhereas larger jumps lead to emission profiles. Asymmetric line profiles are\nfound for models with a cavity outflow and depend on the inclination angle.\nModels with an outflow cavity are favoured to reproduce the SWAS observations\nof the 1_(10)-1_(01) ground-state transition. PACS spectra will tell us about\nthe geometry of these regions, both through the continuum and through the\nlines.

The energy release, E_rel, is equal to the difference in\nmass-energies between the initial (normal) phase configuration and the final\nconfiguration containing a superdense matter core, assuming constant total\nbaryon number and the angular momentum. The calculations are performed with the\nuse of precise pseudo-spectral 2-D numerical code; the polytropic equations of\nstate (EOS) as well as realistic EOSs (Skyrme interactions, Mean Field Theory\nkaon condensate) are used. The results are obtained for a broad range of\nmetastability of initial configuration and size of the new superdense phase\ncore in the final configuration. For a fixed ``overpressure'', dP, defined as\nthe relative excess of central pressure of a collapsing metastable star over\nthe pressure of the equilibrium first-order PT, the energy release up to\nnumerical accuracy does not depend on the stellar angular momentum and\ncoincides with that for nonrotating stars with the same dP. When the equatorial\nradius of the superdense phase core is much smaller than the equatorial radius\nof the star, analytical expressions for the E_rel can be obtained: E_rel is\nproportional to dP^2.5 for small dP. At higher dP, the results of 1-D\ncalculations of E_rel(dP) for non-rotating stars reproduce with very high\nprecision exact 2-D results for fast-rotating stars. The energy release-angular\nmomentum independence for a given overpressure holds also for the so-called\n``strong'' PTs (that destabilise the star against the axi-symmetric\nperturbations), as well as for PTs with ``jumping'' over the energy barrier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2007 12:22:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

If the gluon\npolarization in a proton were as big as needed to resolve the famous \"spin\ncrisis\" then A_LL would be large and positive. Latest RHIC results indicate\nthat A_LL is small and disfavour large positive values of the gluon\npolarization. We examine whether the soft mechanisms (Collins, Sivers,\nBoer-Mulders), essential for generating transverse single spin asymmetries,\nhave any significant influence on A_LL, and whether they could alter the\nconclusion that the gluon polarization is necessarily small. It turns out that\nthe contribution from these effects is essentially negligible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2007 14:55:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Nov 2008 10:49:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

We\napplied our alignment approach to obtain a genome-wide catalogue of conserved\nnon coding blocks (CNBs) between Drosophila melanogaster and 11 other\nDrosophila species. Interestingly, we observe numerous small scale\nrearrangement events, such as local inversions, duplications and\ntranslocations, which are not observable in the whole genome alignments\ncurrently available. The high rate of observed low scale reshuffling show that\nthis database of CNBs can constitute the starting point for several\ninvestigations, related to the evolution of regulatory DNA in Drosophila and\nthe in silico identification of unannotated functional elements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2007 15:16:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-09"}
