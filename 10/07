If sufficiently long-lived, these relics could\nconflict with big bang nucleosynthesis or baryogenesis by dominating the energy\ndensity of the universe. We make a detailed estimate of the decay rate of such\nrelics using the low energy effective action of type IIB string theory\ncompactified on the throat geometry, with attention to powers of the warp\nfactor. We find that it is necessary to turn on SUSY-breaking deformations of\nthe KS background in order to ensure that the most dangerous relics will decay\nfast enough. The decay rate is found to be much larger than the naive guess\nbased on the dimension of the operators which break the angular isometries of\nthe throat.

A popular method to analyze pre-post testing\nresults is the normalized gain first brought to the physics education community\nin wide use by R.R. Hake. This paper presents a measurement based probabilistic\nmodel of the dynamic process of learning that explains the experimentally\nobserved features of the normalized gain. In Hake's study with thousands of\nstudents' pre-post testing results, he observed that on average 48 courses\nemploying \"interactive engagement\" types of instruction achieved average\nnormalized gains about two standard deviations greater than did 14 courses\nsubjected to traditional instruction. For all courses the average normalized\ngains had a very low correlation +0.02 with average pretest scores. This\nfeature of the normalized gain has allowed researchers to investigate the\neffectiveness of instruction using data collected from classes with widely\ndifferent average pretest scores. However, the question of why the average\nnormalized gain has this feature and to what extent this feature is generally\npresent is not well understood. In addition, there have been debates as to what\nthe normalized gain actually measures, and concerns that it lacks a probability\nframework that undergirds psychometric methods such as Item Response Theory\n(IRT). The present model leads to an explanation of the observed features of\nthe normalized gain, connects to other models such as IRT, and shows that the\nnormalized gain does have a probability framework but one different from that\nemphasized by IRT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Oct 2007 16:32:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Jun 2008 23:33:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-24"}

Because circumstellar masers of these objects were resolved\ninto several components, proper motions for the maser sources were derived with\nseveral different methods.

Since the repressors and their binding sites often appear in low\ncopy numbers, the oscillations are noisy and irregular. Therefore, the\nrepressilator circuit cannot be fully analyzed using deterministic methods such\nas rate-equations. Here we perform stochastic analysis of the repressilator\ncircuit using the master equation and Monte Carlo simulations. It is found that\nfluctuations modify the range of conditions in which oscillations appear as\nwell as their amplitude and period, compared to the deterministic equations.\nThe deterministic and stochastic approaches coincide only in the limit in which\nall the relevant components, including free proteins, plasmids and bound\nproteins, appear in high copy numbers.
