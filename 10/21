In fact, they are\nable to produce faint but extended gaseous tails. Such low-mass, starless,\ntidal debris may become detached and appear as free floating clouds in the very\ndeep HI surveys that are currently being carried out. We show in this paper\nthat these debris possess the same apparent properties as the so-called \"Dark\nGalaxies\", objects originally detected in HI, with no optical counterpart, and\npresumably dark matter dominated. We present a numerical model of the prototype\nof such Dark Galaxies - VirgoHI21 -, that is able to reproduce its main\ncharacteristics: the one-sided tail linking it to the spiral galaxy NGC 4254,\nthe absence of stars, and above all the reversal of the velocity gradient along\nthe tail originally attributed to rotation motions caused by a massive dark\nmatter halo and which we find to be consistent with simple streaming motions\nplus projection effects. According to our numerical simulations, this tidal\ndebris was expelled 750 Myr ago during a fly-by at 1100 km/s of NGC 4254 by a\nmassive companion which should now lie at a projected distance of about 400\nkpc. A candidate for the intruder is discussed. The existence of galaxies that\nhave never been able to form stars had already been challenged based on\ntheoretical and observational grounds. Tidal collisions, in particular those\noccurring at high speed, provide a much more simple explanation for the origin\nof such putative Dark Galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Oct 2007 08:19:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Once formed, these vortices essentially survive forever.\nWhat happens in three dimensions? We show with pseudospectral simulations that\nin 3D a vortex in a short box forms and survives just as in 2D. But a vortex in\na tall box is unstable and is destroyed. In our simulation, the unstable vortex\ndecays into a transient turbulent-like state that transports angular momentum\noutward at a nearly constant rate for hundreds of orbital times. The 3D\ninstability that destroys vortices is a generalization of the 2D instability\nthat forms them. We derive the conditions for these nonlinear instabilities to\nact by calculating the coupling between linear modes, and thereby derive the\ncriterion for a vortex to survive in 3D as it does in 2D: the azimuthal extent\nof the vortex must be larger than the scale height of the accretion disk. When\nthis criterion is violated, the vortex is unstable and decays. Because vortices\nare longer in azimuthal than in radial extent by a factor that is inversely\nproportional to their excess vorticity, a vortex with given radial extent will\nonly survive in a 3D disk if it is sufficiently weak. This counterintuitive\nresult explains why previous 3D simulations always yielded decaying vortices:\ntheir vortices were too strong. We conclude that in protoplanetary disks weak\nvortices can trap dust and serve as the nurseries of planet formation. Decaying\nstrong vortices might be responsible for the outwards transport of angular\nmomentum that is required to make accretion disks accrete.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Oct 2007 20:06:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Feb 2009 22:32:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-20"}

This mechanism is\nassociated with the shear-current effect which is related to the W x J-term in\nthe mean electromotive force. This effect causes the generation of the\nlarge-scale magnetic field even in a nonrotating and nonhelical homogeneous\nsheared turbulent convection whereby the alpha effect vanishes. It is found\nthat turbulent convection promotes the shear-current dynamo instability, i.e.,\nthe heat flux causes positive contribution to the shear-current effect.\nHowever, there is no dynamo action due to the shear-current effect for small\nhydrodynamic and magnetic Reynolds numbers even in a turbulent convection, if\nthe spatial scaling for the turbulent correlation time is k^{-2}, where k is\nthe small-scale wave number. We discuss here also the nonlinear mean-field\ndynamo due to the shear-current effect and take into account the transport of\nmagnetic helicity as a dynamical nonlinearity. The magnetic helicity flux\nstrongly affects the magnetic field dynamics in the nonlinear stage of the\ndynamo action. When the magnetic helicity flux is not small, the saturated\nlevel of the mean magnetic field is of the order of the equipartition field\ndetermined by the turbulent kinetic energy. The obtained results are important\nfor elucidation of origin of the large-scale magnetic fields in astrophysical\nand cosmic sheared turbulent plasma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Oct 2007 14:11:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
