We use cosmological adaptive mesh refinement\nsimulations that include self-consistent Population III star formation and\nfeedback to examine the properties of assembling early dwarf galaxies. Accurate\nradiative transport is modeled with adaptive ray tracing. We include supernova\nexplosions and follow the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium. The\ncalculations focus on the formation of several dwarf galaxies and their\nprogenitors. In these halos, baryon fractions in 10^8 solar mass halos decrease\nby a factor of 2 with stellar feedback and by a factor of 3 with supernova\nexplosions. We find that radiation feedback and supernova explosions increase\ngaseous spin parameters up to a factor of 4 and vary with time. Stellar\nfeedback, supernova explosions, and H_2 cooling create a complex, multi-phase\ninterstellar medium whose densities and temperatures can span up to 6 orders of\nmagnitude at a given radius. The pair-instability supernovae of Population III\nstars alone enrich the halos with virial temperatures of 10^4 K to\napproximately 10^{-3} of solar metallicity.

For example, if the boundaries favor the high shear rate phase\nthen hysteresis is suppressed at the low shear rate edges of the stress\nplateau. If the boundaries favor the low shear rate state, then the high shear\nrate band can lie in the center of the flow cell, leading to a three-band\nconfiguration. Sufficiently strong stress gradients due to curved flow\ngeometries, such as that of cylindrical Couette flow, can convert this to a\ntwo-band state by forcing the high shear rate phase against the wall of higher\nstress, and can suppress the hysteresis loop observed during a shear rate\nsweep.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2007 18:45:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-11"}

LSR1835+32 exhibits\npersistent radio emission and H-alpha variability on timescales of ~0.5-2 hr.\nThe detected UV flux is consistent with photospheric emission, and no X-ray\nemission is detected to a deep limit of L_X/L_bol<10^-5.7. The H-alpha and\nradio emission are temporally uncorrelated, and the ratio of radio to X-ray\nluminosity exceeds the correlation seen in F-M6 stars by >2x10^4. Similarly,\nL_Halpha/L_X>10 is at least 30 times larger than in early M dwarfs, and\neliminates coronal emission as the source of chromospheric heating. The lack of\nradio variability during four rotations of LSR1835+32 requires a uniform\nstellar-scale field of ~10 G, and indicates that the H-alpha variability is\ndominated by much smaller scales, <10% of the chromospheric volume. VB10, on\nthe other hand, shows correlated flaring and quiescent X-ray and UV emission,\nsimilar to the behavior of early M dwarfs. Delayed and densely-sampled optical\nspectra exhibit a similar range of variability amplitudes and timescales to\nthose seen in the X-rays and UV, with L_Halpha/L_X~1. Along with our previous\nobservations of the M8.5 dwarf TVLM513-46546 we conclude that late M dwarfs\nexhibit a mix of activity patterns, which points to a transition in the\nstructure and heating of the outer atmosphere by large-scale magnetic fields.\nWe find that rotation may play a role in generating the fields as evidenced by\na tentative correlation between radio activity and rotation velocity.

The precise contribution of each\ncomponent may depend on the intrinsic physical properties of the YSO-disk\nsystem as well as its evolutionary stage. In this context, the present article\nstarts a systematic investigation of two-component jet models via\ntime-dependent simulations of two prototypical and complementary analytical\nsolutions, each closely related to the properties of stellar-outflows and\ndisk-winds. These models describe a meridionally and a radially self-similar\nexact solution of the steady-state, ideal hydromagnetic equations,\nrespectively. By using the PLUTO code to carry out the simulations, the study\nfocuses on the topological stability of each of the two analytical solutions,\nwhich are successfully extended to all space by removing their singularities.\nIn addition, their behavior and robustness over several physical and numerical\nmodifications is extensively examined. It is found that radially self-similar\nsolutions (disk-winds) always reach a final steady-state while maintaining all\ntheir well-defined properties. The different ways to replace the singular part\nof the solution around the symmetry axis, being a first approximation towards a\ntwo-component outflow, lead to the appearance of a shock at the super-fast\ndomain corresponding to the fast magnetosonic separatrix surface. Conversely,\nthe asymptotic configuration and the stability of meridionally self-similar\nmodels (stellar-winds) is related to the heating processes at the base of the\nwind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2007 22:22:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

These components are, the underlying\ncontact structure among individuals that determines the pattern of disease\ntransmission; and the evolution of this pattern over time. Mathematical models\nof infectious diseases, which are in principle analytically tractable, use two\ngeneral approaches to incorporate these elements. The first approach, generally\nknown as compartmental modeling, addresses the time evolution of disease spread\nat the expense of simplifying the pattern of transmission. On the other hand,\nthe second approach uses network theory to incorporate detailed information\npertaining to the underlying contact structure among individuals.

This model differs\nfrom traditional models of supernova debris interacting with external CSM in\nthat here the shell is optically thick and the escape of radiation is delayed.\nWe show that any model attempting to account for SN2006gy's huge luminosity\nwith radiation emitted by ongoing CSM interaction fails for the following basic\nreason: the CSM density required to achieve the observed luminosity makes the\nsame circumstellar envelope opaque, forcing a thermal diffusion solution. In\nour model, the weaker CSM interaction giving rise to SN2006gy's characteristic\nType IIn spectrum and soft X-rays is not linked to the power source of the\nvisual continuum; instead, it arises after the blast wave breaks free of the\nopaque shell into the surrounding wind.

Moreover any probabilistic model used to\ndescribe a random experiment is consistent only with a specific protocol\ntelling how the random experiment has to be performed.In this sense the quantum\ntheory is a statistical and contextual theory of phenomena. In this paper we\ndiscuss these important topics in some detail. Besides we discuss in historical\nperspective various prerequisites used in the proofs of Bell and CHSH\ninequalities concluding that the violation of these inequalities in spin\npolarization correlation experiments is neither a proof of the completeness of\nQT nor of its nonlocality. The question whether QT is predictably complete is\nstill open and it should be answered by a careful and unconventional analysis\nof the experimental data. It is sufficient to analyze more in detail the\nexisting experimental data by using various non-parametric purity tests and\nother specific statistical tools invented to study the fine structure of the\ntime-series. The correct understanding of statistical and contextual character\nof QT has far reaching consequences for the quantum information and quantum\ncomputing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Oct 2007 13:47:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-04"}

Methods: High-energy stellar luminosity varies over a wide range for G\nfield stars. The temporal evolution of the distribution of stellar X-ray\nluminosity and its influence on the evolution of close-in exoplanets is\ninvestigated. X-ray luminosity distributions from the Pleiades, the Hyades and\nthe field are used to derive a scaling law for the evolution of the stellar\nX-ray luminosity distribution. A modified energy-limited escape approach is\nused to calculate atmospheric mass loss for a broad range of planetary\nparameters. Results: We show that the evolution of close-in exoplanets strongly\ndepends on the detailed X-ray luminosity history of their host stars, which\nvaries over several orders-of-magnitude for G stars. Stars located at the\nhigh-energy tail of the luminosity distribution can evaporate most of its\nplanets within 0.5 AU, while for a moderate luminosity a significant fraction\nof planets can survive. We show the change on an initial planetary mass\ndistribution caused by atmospheric escape.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Oct 2007 15:15:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-19"}

In order to keep the account concise while\nremaining self contained, only the barest essentials of the standard nuclear\nphysical and astrophysical calculations involved are given.

Attention is drawn to the important\nconsequences of three coincidental relationships between these parameters.
