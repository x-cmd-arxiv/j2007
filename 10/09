The\ndynamics is a pure Darwinian rule with both fundamental ingredients to drive\nevolution: 1) random mutations and crossings which act in the sense of\nincreasing the entropy (or diversity); and 2) selection which acts in the\nopposite sense by limiting the entropy explosion. Selection wins this\ncompetition if mutations performed at birth are few enough. By slowly\nincreasing the average number m of mutations, however, the population suddenly\nundergoes a mutational degradation precisely at a transition point mc. Above\nthis point, the \"bad\" alleles spread over the genetic pool of the population,\novercoming the selection pressure. Individuals become selectively alike, and\nevolution stops. Only below this point, m < mc, evolutionary life is possible.\n  The finite-size-scaling behaviour of this transition is exhibited for large\nenough \"chromosome\" lengths L. One important and surprising observation is the\nL-independence of the transition curves, for large L. They are also independent\non the population size. Another is that mc is near unity, i.e. life cannot be\nstable with much more than one mutation per diploid genome, independent of the\nchromosome length, in agreement with reality. One possible consequence is that\nan eventual evolutionary jump towards larger L enabling the storage of more\ngenetic information would demand an improved DNA copying machinery in order to\nkeep the same total number of mutations per offspring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2007 19:58:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The goal of the present paper is to understand the\ndependence of this interesting result on the principal new features it\nintroduced relative to Gupta-Kumar: (1) a capacity-based formula for link\ntransmission bit-rates in terms of received signal-to-interference-and-noise\nratio (SINR); (2) hierarchical routing from sources to destinations through a\nsystem of communal highways; and (3) cell-based routes constructed by\npercolation. The conclusion of the present paper is that the improved\nthroughput scaling is principally due to the percolation-based routing, which\nenables shorter hops and, consequently, less interference. This is established\nby showing that throughput $\\Omega({1 \\over \\sqrt{n}})$ can be attained by a\nsystem that does not employ highways, but instead uses percolation to\nestablish, for each source-destination pair, a set of $\\Theta(\\log n)$ routes\nwithin a narrow routing corridor running from source to destination.

In addition, it is shown that throughput\n$\\Omega({1 \\over \\sqrt{n}})$ can be attained with the original threshold\ntransmission bit-rate model, provided that node transmission powers are\npermitted to grow with $n$.

The very few void AGN in massive bright\nhosts accrete more strongly, are more obscured, and are associated with younger\nstellar emission than wall AGN. Thus, accretion strength is probably connected\nto the availability of fuel supply, and accretion and star-formation co-evolve\nand rely on the same source of fuel. Nearest neighbor statistics indicate that\nthe weak accretion activity (LINER-like) is not influenced by the local\nenvironment.

Non-chiral real, complex and\nsinglet representations, however, provide viable fermion dark matter\ncandidates. Although any one of these candidates will be virtually impossible\nto detect at the LHC, it is shown that they may be detected at future planned\ndirect detection experiments. For the real case, an irreducible radiative\ncoupling to quarks may allow a detection. The complex case in general has an\nexperimentally ruled out tree-level coupling to quarks via Z-boson exchange.\nHowever, in the case of two SU(2)_L doublets, a higher dimensional coupling to\nthe Higgs can suppress this coupling, and a remaining irreducible radiative\ncoupling may allow a detection. Singlet dark matter could be detected through a\ncoupling to quarks via Higgs exchange. Since all non-chiral dark matter can\nhave a coupling to the Higgs, at least some of its mass can be obtained from\nelectroweak symmetry breaking, and this mass is a useful characterization of\nits direct detection cross-section.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2007 01:59:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2009 07:49:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-17"}

After integrating out heavy KK\nmodes we find the effective action for the zero mode fields. We find that in\nthe $\\mathbb{R}^{3,1} \\times S^{1}$ topology the heavy modes do not decouple in\nthe effective action, due to the zero mode of the 5-th component of the 5-d\ngauge field $A_{5}$. Because $A_{5}$ is a scalar under 4-d Lorentz\ntransformations, there is no gauge symmetry protecting it from getting mass and\n$A_{5}^{4}$ interaction terms after loop corrections. In addition, after\nsymmetry breaking, we find new divergences in the $A_{5}$ mass that did not\nappear in the symmetric phase. The new divergences are traced back to the\ngauge-goldstone mixing that occurs after symmetry breaking. The relevance of\nthese new divergences to Symanzik's theorem is discussed. In order to get a\nmore sensible theory we investigate the $S^{1}/\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$\ncompactification. With this kind of compact topology, the $A_{5}$ zero mode\ndisappears.

The favoured hypothesis is a fossil origin of the\nmagnetic field, in which the magnetic fields of Ap/Bp stars are relics of those\nwhich existed in the parental molecular clouds during the formation. This\nimplies that the magnetic field must survive all the initial phases of the\nstellar evolution and especially the pre-main sequence (PMS) phase.

The spread in results gives an\nestimation of theoretical uncertainties and so has been quoted.\n  Most observables studied change only at the level of a few per cent when\nchanging the interaction potential.\n  Another source of theoretical uncertainty is the use of nonrelativistic\nkinematics in the evaluation of the orbital wave functions and the construction\nof our nonrelativistic states, although we think that a good part of these\nrelativistic effects are contained in an effective way in the parameters of the\nquark-quark potentials, which were adjusted in the original works to reproduce\nthe experimental spectra of mesons. Mesons wave functions have been evaluated\nusing a Numerov algorithm, while for baryons the three body problem has been\nsolved using a variational approach with ansatz wave functions that include\nsimplifications that arise from HQS and HQSS. To compute hadron decays we have\nrelied on the impulse approximation, which induces small axial and vector\ncurrent conservation violations due to binding effects.

According to several experimental,\ntheoretical and field results, the only possible propagation of sound waves in\na dry sand bed under gravity is through an infinite, yet discrete, number of\ndispersive surface modes. Besides, we present a series of evidences, most of\nwhich have already been published in the literature, that the frequency of\nbooming avalanches is not controlled by any resonance as argued in this\narticle.
