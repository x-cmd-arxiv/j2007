These may arise in the aftermath of events like mergers, accretion,\nand tidal interactions. These events are key in the evolution of galaxies. In\nthis paper we quantify the large-scale lopsidedness of light distributions in\n25155 galaxies at z < 0.06 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 4\nusing the m = 1 azimuthal Fourier mode. We show that the lopsided distribution\nof light is primarily due to a corresponding lopsidedness in the stellar mass\ndistribution. Observational effects, such as seeing, Poisson noise, and\ninclination, introduce only small errors in lopsidedness for the majority of\nthis sample. We find that lopsidedness correlates strongly with other basic\ngalaxy structural parameters: galaxies with low concentration, stellar mass,\nand stellar surface mass density tend to be lopsided, while galaxies with high\nconcentration, mass, and density are not. We find that the strongest and most\nfundamental relationship between lopsidedness and the other structural\nparameters is with the surface mass density. We also find, in agreement with\nprevious studies, that lopsidedness tends to increase with radius. Both these\nresults may be understood as a consequence of several factors. The outer\nregions of galaxies and low-density galaxies are more susceptible to tidal\nperturbations, and they also have longer dynamical times (so lopsidedness will\nlast longer). They are also more likely to be affected by any underlying\nasymmetries in the dark matter halo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2007 17:12:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

Feigenbaum\nand by P. Coullet and C. Tresser in the nineteen-seventieth to study the\nasymptotic small scale geometry of the attractor of one-dimensional systems\nwhich are at the transition from simple to chaotic dynamics. This geometry\nturns out to not depend on the choice of the map under rather mild smoothness\nconditions. The existence of a unique renormalization fixed point which is also\nhyperbolic among generic smooth enough maps plays a crucial role in the\ncorresponding renormalization theory. The uniqueness and hyperbolicity of the\nrenormalization fixed point were first shown in the holomorphic context, by\nmeans that generalize to other renormalization operators. It was then proved\nthat in the space of $C^{2+\\alpha}$ unimodal maps, for $\\alpha$ close to one,\nthe period doubling renormalization fixed point is hyperbolic as well. In this\npaper we study what happens when one approaches from below the minimal\nsmoothness thresholds for the uniqueness and for the hyperbolicity of the\nperiod doubling renormalization generic fixed point. Indeed, our main results\nstates that in the space of $C^2$ unimodal maps the analytic fixed point is not\nhyperbolic and that the same remains true when adding enough smoothness to get\na priori bounds. In this smoother class, called $C^{2+|\\cdot|}$ the failure of\nhyperbolicity is tamer than in $C^2$. Things get much worse with just a bit\nless of smoothness than $C^2$ as then even the uniqueness is lost and other\nasymptotic behavior become possible. We show that the period doubling\nrenormalization operator acting on the space of $C^{1+Lip}$ unimodal maps has\ninfinite topological entropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2007 22:51:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-04"}

Covariant derivatives of orders 4,5,6 yield one\nadditional invariant each, and $\\nabla^{(7)}R$ is needed for invariant\nclassification. Thus, our class proves that the bound of 7 on the order of the\ncovariant derivative, first established by Karlhede, is sharp. Our finding\ncorrects an outstanding assertion that invariant classification of\nfour-dimensional Lorentzian manifolds requires at most $\\nabla^{(6)}R$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2007 14:07:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2007 10:26:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 6 Oct 2007 10:27:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The most likely explanations are either the\npresence of differential reddening or an age spread among the young stars.\nAssuming the latter, simulations indicate that we cannot exclude the\npossibility that stars in NGC 346 might have formed in two distinct events\noccurring about 10 and 5 Myr ago, respectively. We find that the PMS stars are\nnot homogeneously distributed across NGC 346, but instead are grouped in at\nleast five different clusters. On spatial scales from 0.8$''$ to 8$''$ (0.24 to\n2.4 pc at the distance of the SMC) the clustering of the PMS stars as computed\nby a two-point angular correlation function is self-similar with a power law\nslope $\\gamma \\approx -0.3$. The clustering properties are quite similar to\nMilky Way star forming regions like Orion OB or $\\rho$ Oph.

We base our discussion on the ejecta\nproperties and the spectroscopic signatures obtained from time-dependent\nsimulations, investigating different ejecta configurations, and covering their\nevolution from one day to six weeks after shock breakout. Compared to\nequivalent steady-state models, our time-dependent models produce SN ejecta\nthat are systematically over-ionized, affecting helium at one week after\nexplosion, but ultimately affecting all ions after a few weeks.

NeXT aims to perform wide band imaging\nspectroscopy.

To cover this wide energy range, we are in the process of developing\na hybrid X-ray camera, Wideband X-ray Imager (WXI) as a focal plane detector of\nthe supermirror.

It is found that two order parameters with the symmetries $X_3$\nand $\\Delta_5$ induce the structural transformation from the high-temperature\ncubic to the low-temperature monoclinic phase. The coupling between the order\nparameters is described by the Landau free energy functional. The electronic\nand crystal structure for the cubic and monoclinic phases were optimized using\nthe {\\it ab initio} density functional method. The electronic structure\ncalculations were performed within the generalized gradient approximation\nincluding the on-site interactions between 3d electrons at iron ions -- the\nCoulomb element $U$ and Hund's exchange $J$. Only when these local interactions\nare taken into account, the phonon dispersion curves, obtained by the direct\nmethod for the cubic phase, reproduce the experimental data. It is shown that\nthe interplay of local electron interations and the coupling to the lattice\ndrives the phonon order parameters and is responsible for the opening of the\ngap at the Fermi energy. Thus, it is found that the metal-insulator transition\nin magnetite is promoted by local electron interactions, which significantly\namplify the electron-phonon interaction and stabilize weak charge order\ncoexisting with orbital order of the occupied $t_{2g}$ states at Fe ions. This\nprovides a scenario to understand the fundamental problem of the origin of the\nVerwey transition in magnetite.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2007 14:09:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-27"}

The continuum radio emission has been\ninterpreted as gyrosyncrotron emission arising from a thin magnetospheric\nlayer. Previous radio observations at 1.4 GHz showed that a 100% circular\npolarized and highly directive emission component overlaps to the continuum\nemission two times per rotation, when the magnetic axis lies in the plane of\nthe sky. This sort of radio lighthouse has been proposed to be due to cyclotron\nmaser emission generated above the magnetic pole and propagating\nperpendicularly to the magnetic axis. Observations carried out with the\nAustralia Telescope Compact Array at 1.4 and 2.5 GHz one year after this\ndiscovery show that this radio emission is still present, meaning that the\nphenomenon responsible for this process is steady on a timescale of years. The\nemitted radiation spans at least 1 GHz, being observed from 1.4 to 2.5 GHz. On\nthe light of recent results on the physics of the magnetosphere of this star,\nthe possibility of plasma radiation is ruled out. The characteristics of this\nradio lighthouse provides us a good marker of the rotation period, since the\npeaks are visible at particular rotational phases. After one year, they show a\ndelay of about 15 minutes. This is interpreted as a new abrupt spinning down of\nthe star. Among several possibilities, a quick emptying of the equatorial\nmagnetic belt after reaching the maximum density can account for the magnitude\nof the breaking. The study of the coherent emission in stars like CU Vir, as\nwell as in pre main sequence stars, can give important insight into the angular\nmomentum evolution in young stars. This is a promising field of investigation\nthat high sensitivity radio interferometers such as SKA can exploit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2007 15:35:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2007 06:54:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2007 12:01:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
