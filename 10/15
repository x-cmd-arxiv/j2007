In a recent publication [1] we introduced a generalized SLE\ndriven by a superposition of a Brownian motion and a fractal set of jumps\n(technically a stable L\\'evy process). We then discussed the small-scale\nproperties of the resulting L\\'evy-SLE growth process.

This limiting behavior is independent of the Brownian forcing and\ndepends upon only a single parameter, $\\alpha$, which defines the shape of the\nstable L\\'evy distribution. We learn about this behavior by studying a\nFokker-Planck equation which gives the probability distribution for endpoints\nof the trace as a function of time.

We also study the non linear vertical\nresponse of the disc numerically using an analogous one dimensional slab model.\nFor global warps, we find that in order for the disc vertical structure to\nrespond as a quasi uniform shift or tilt, as has been assumed in previous work,\nthe product of the ratio of the external radiation momentum flux to the local\ndisc mid plane pressure, where it is absorbed, with the disc aspect ratio\nshould be significantly less than unity. Namely, this quantity should be of the\norder of or smaller than the ratio of the disc gas density corresponding to the\nlayer intercepting radiation to the mid plane density, $\\lambda \\ll 1$.

First, we consider the averaging attack where a random\ncoding argument is used to show that the rate 1/2 is achievable with t=2\npirates. Our study is then extended to the general case of arbitrary $t$\nhighlighting the underlying complexity-performance tradeoff. Overall, these\nresults establish the significant performance gains offered by minimum distance\ndecoding as compared to other approaches based on orthogonal codes and\ncorrelation detectors. In the second scenario, we characterize the achievable\nrates, with minimum distance decoding, under any collusion attack that\nsatisfies the marking assumption.

However, in graphene we find that these states\npenetrate a much longer distance of the order of the width of the contacts. As\na result, ballistic graphene samples with a length less than their width can\nexhibit a resistance proportional to length that is not Ohmic in origin, but\narises from a reduced role of contact-induced states. While actual samples are\nprobably not ballistic and involve scattering processes, our results show that\nthese contact induced effects need to be taken into account in interpreting\nexperiments and minimum conductivity depends strongly on the structure and\nconfiguration (two- vs. four-terminal) used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2007 06:48:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Here we summarize our\nrecent efforts to use chiral perturbation theory in order to systematically\nrelate a_nn to the shape of the neutron spectrum in the reaction pi- d --> n n\ngamma. In particular we show how the chiral symmetry of QCD relates this\nprocess to low-energy electroweak reactions such as p p --> d e+ nu_e. This\nallows us to reduce the uncertainty in the extracted a_nn (mainly due to\nshort-distance physics in the two-nucleon system) by a factor of more than\nthree, to <0.05 fm. We also report first results on the impact that two-nucleon\nmechanisms of chiral order P^4 have on the pi- d --> n n gamma neutron\nspectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2007 14:38:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-17"}

Rather, our\ngoal is to develop theoretical and computational tools for temporal model\nbuilding tasks in computational semantics. To this end, we present a\nfirst-order theory of time and events which is rich enough to capture\ninteresting semantic distinctions, and an algorithm which takes minimal models\nfor first-order theories and systematically attempts to ``perturb'' their\ntemporal component to provide non-minimal, but semantically significant,\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2007 15:45:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-16"}

These\nmotions, determined by the potential in the inner parts, can break the\ndisk-halo degeneracy. Here, two main fluid dynamical approaches have been\nchosen to model the non-circular motions in the bar region; a 2-D Eulerian grid\ncode for an isothermal gas (FS2) and a 3-D smoothed particle hydrodynamic code\n(N-body/SPH). Aims: The aim of this paper is to compare and quantify the\ndifferences of the gas flows in rotating barred potential obtained using two\ndifferent fluid dynamical approaches. We analyse the effect of using 2-D and a\n3-D codes in the calculation of gas flow in barred galaxies and to which extend\nthe results are affected by the code. To do this, we derive the velocity field\nand density maps for the mass model of NGC 4123 using a 3-D N-body/SPH code and\ncompare the results to the previous 2-D Eulerian grid code results. Methods:\nNumerical modelling, 3-D N-body/SPH simulations Results: The global velocity\nfield and the gas distribution is very similar in both models. The study shows\nthat the position and strength of the shocks developed in the SPH simulations\ndo not vary significantly compared to the results derived from the 2-D FS2\ncode. The largest velocity difference across the shock is 20\\kms between the\n2-D and 3-D fluid dynamical models. Conclusions: The results obtained in the\nstudies deriving the dark matter content of barred galaxies using the bar\nstreaming motions and strength and position of shocks are robust to the fluid\ndynamical model used. The effect of 2-D and 3-D modelling can be neglected in\nthis type of studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2007 15:56:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
