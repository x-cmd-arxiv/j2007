In particular, we show that, in the classical linear\nstatistical model, the ratio of the variance of one component of the solution\nby the variance of the right-hand side is exactly the condition number of this\nsolution component when perturbations on the right-hand side are considered. We\nalso provide fragment codes using LAPACK routines to compute the\nvariance-covariance matrix and the least squares conditioning and we give the\ncorresponding computational cost. Finally we present a small historical\nnumerical example that was used by Laplace in Theorie Analytique des\nProbabilites, 1820, for computing the mass of Jupiter and experiments from the\nspace industry with real physical data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2007 16:29:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-04"}

We analyze the\ndynamics with constant and time-dependent volatilities of the underlying asset\nreturns. We present a comparison between the precision of the standard Monte\nCarlo method (MC) and the stratified Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS). In\nparticular, we discuss the use of low-discrepancy sequences, also known as\nQuasi-Monte Carlo method (QMC), and a randomized version of these sequences,\nknown as Randomized Quasi Monte Carlo (RQMC). The latter has proven to be a\nuseful variance reduction technique for both problems of up to 20 dimensions\nand for very high dimensions. Moreover, we present and test a new path\ngeneration approach based on a Kronecker product approximation (KPA) in the\ncase of time-dependent volatilities. KPA proves to be a fast generation\ntechnique and reduces the computational cost of the simulation procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2007 17:38:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-04"}

An interesting\nquestion was raised as to whether the linear realization of the chiral symmetry\nis asymptotically restored for highly excited states. We address it in a number\nof ways. On the phenomenological side we argue that to the extent the meson\nRegge trajectories are observed to be linear and equidistant, the Weyl--Wigner\nmode is not realized.\n  This picture is supported by quasiclassical arguments implying that the quark\nspin interactions in high excitations are weak, the trajectories are linear,\nand there is no chiral symmetry restoration. Then we use the string/gauge\nduality. In the top-down Sakai--Sugimoto construction the nonlinear realization\nof the chiral symmetry is built in. In the bottom-up AdS/QCD construction by\nErlich et al., and Karch et al. the situation is more ambiguous. However, in\nthis approach linearity and equidistance of the Regge trajectories can be\nnaturally implemented, with the chiral symmetry in the Nambu--Goldstone mode.\n  Asymptotic chiral symmetry restoration might be possible if a nonlinearity\n(convergence) of the Regge trajectories in an \"intermediate window\" of $n,J$,\nbeyond the explored domain, takes place.

Here we test this idea by\ncomparing the rate of luminosity evolution of massive early-type galaxies in\nclusters at 0.02<z<0.83 to the rate of their color evolution. A combined fit to\nthe rest-frame U-V color evolution and the previously measured evolution of the\nM/L_B ratio gives x~-0.3 for the logarithmic slope of the IMF in the region\naround 1 Solar mass, flatter than the present-day value in the Milky Way disk\nof x=1.3. The best-fitting luminosity-weighted formation redshift of the stars\nin massive cluster galaxies is ~3.7, and a possible interpretation is that the\ncharacteristic mass m_c had a value of ~2 Solar masses at z~4 (compared to\nm_c~0.1 Solar masses today), in qualitative agreement with models in which the\ncharacteristic mass is a function of the Jeans mass in molecular clouds. Such a\n``bottom-light'' IMF for massive cluster galaxies has significant implications\nfor the interpretation of measurements of galaxy formation and evolution.\nApplying a simple form of IMF evolution to literature data, we find that the\nvolume-averaged star formation rate at high redshift may have been\noverestimated (by a factor of 3-4 at z>4), and the cosmic star formation\nhistory may have a fairly well-defined peak at z~1.5. The M/L_V ratios of\ngalaxies are less affected than their star formation rates, and future data on\nthe stellar mass density at z>3 will provide further constraints on IMF\nevolution. The formal errors likely underestimate the uncertainties, and\nconfirmation of thes results requires a larger sample of clusters and the\ninclusion of redder rest-frame colors in the analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2007 20:00:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Oct 2007 21:04:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2007 18:26:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-07"}

NGC1533 appears to be completing a\ntransition from late to early type: it is red, but not quite dead. Faint spiral\nstructure becomes visible following galaxy subtraction, and luminous blue stars\ncan be seen in isolated areas of the disk. Dust is visible in the color map in\nthe region around the bar, and there is a linear color gradient throughout the\ndisk. We determine an accurate distance from the surface brightness\nfluctuations (SBF) method, finding m-M = 31.44\\pm0.12 mag, or d = 19.4\\pm1.1\nMpc. We then study the globular cluster (GC) colors, sizes, and luminosity\nfunction (GCLF). Estimates of the distance from the median of the GC half-light\nradii and from the peak of the GCLF both agree well with the SBF distance. The\nGC specific frequency is S_N=1.3\\pm0.2, typical for an early-type disk galaxy.\nThe color distribution is bimodal, as commonly observed for bright galaxies.\nThere is a suggestion of the redder GCs having smaller sizes, but the trend is\nnot significant. The sizes do increase significantly with galactocentric\nradius, in a manner more similar to the Milky Way GC system than to those in\nVirgo. This difference may be an effect of the steeper density gradients in\nloose groups as compared to galaxy clusters. Additional studies of early-type\ngalaxies in low density regions can help determine if this is indeed a general\nenvironmental trend.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2007 21:19:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-05"}

The width of the primary dip is found to be\nincreasing with energy. The broad-band energy spectrum of the pulsar is well\ndescribed with a Negative and Positive power-law with EXponential (NPEX)\ncontinuum model along with a blackbody component for soft excess. A weak iron\nK_alpha emission line with an equivalent width ~25 eV was detected in the\nsource spectrum.

The higher value of the column density is believed to be the cause\nof the secondary dip at the soft X-ray energy band. The iron line equivalent\nwidth is found to be constant (within errors) over the pulse phase.

The\ngamma-rays are produced by inverse Compton scattering of the stellar light by\nVHE electrons accelerated in the vicinity of the compact object. The VHE\nemission from LS 5039 displays an orbital modulation.\n  The inverse Compton spectrum depends on the angle between the incoming and\noutgoing photon in the electron rest frame. Since the angle at which an\nobserver sees the star and electrons changes with the orbit, a phase dependence\nof the spectrum is expected. The phase-dependent spectrum of LS 5039 is\ncalculated, assuming a continuous injection of electrons. The shape of the\nelectron distribution depends on the injected power-law and on the magnetic\nfield intensity.\n  Anisotropic scattering produces hard emission at inferior conjunction, when\nattenuation due to pair production of the VHE gamma-rays on star light is\nminimum.

Presupposing a\nconventional unitary theory of low-energy quantum gravity, it offers all this\nby taking the physical density operator of a closed system to be the partial\ntrace of its total density operator (assumed pure) over gravity and by defining\nits physical entropy to be its `matter-gravity entanglement entropy'.

The\nwaiting-time distribution is consistent with being exponential in seven out of\nnine pulsars where it can be measured reliably, after adjusting for\nobservational limits on the minimum waiting time, as for a constant-rate\nPoisson process.
