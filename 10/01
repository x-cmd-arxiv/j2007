We consider neutralinos of particle mass 36 GeV and 100 GeV,\nrespectively. The former is able to produce ~7 electron/positron particles per\nannihilation through the fremionic channel, and the latter ~53 particles\nassuming a purely bosonic channel. High energy electron/positron particles\nup-scatter the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons into higher energies\nvia the inverse-Compton scattering. The process produces a power-law\nelectron/positron energy spectrum of index -1 in the energy range of interest,\nindependent of the initial energy distribution. The corresponding energy\nspectrum of the up-scattered photons is a power-law of index -1/2, if\nabsorption by the gas is not included. The scattered photons photo-heat the gas\nby releasing electrons which deposit a fraction (14%)of their energy as heat\ninto the ambient medium. For uniformly distributed neutralinos the heating is\ninsignificant. The effect is greatly enhanced by the clumping of neutralinos\ninto dense haloes. We use a time-dependent clumping model which takes into\naccount the damping of density fluctuations on mass scales smaller than\n~10^{-6}M_sol. With this clumping model, the heating mechanism boosts the gas\ntemperature above that of the CMB after a redshift of z 30.

Equivariant quantization and dequantization establish a\ntight link between invariant operators connecting modules of differential\noperators on tensor densities, and module morphisms that connect the\ncorresponding dequantized spaces. In this paper, we investigate dequantized\ndifferential operators as modules over a Lie subalgebra of vector fields that\npreserve an additional structure. More precisely, we take an interest in\ninvariant operators between dequantized spaces, viewed as modules over the Lie\nsubalgebra of infinitesimal contact or projective contact transformations. The\nprincipal symbols of these invariant operators are invariant tensor fields. We\nfirst provide full description of the algebras of such affine-contact- and\ncontact-invariant tensor fields. These characterizations allow showing that the\nalgebra of projective-contact-invariant operators between dequantized spaces\nimplemented by the same density weight, is generated by the vertical cotangent\nlift of the contact form and a generalized contact Hamiltonian. As an\napplication, we prove a second key-result, which asserts that the Casimir\noperator of the Lie algebra of infinitesimal projective contact\ntransformations, is diagonal.

The nu-process and the following proton and neutron capture\nreactions produce odd-Z iron-peak elements in complete and incomplete Si\nburning region. This reaction sequence enhances the abundances of Sc, Mn, and\nCo in the supernova ejecta. The supernova explosion models of 15 M_sol and 25\nM_sol stars with the nu-process well reproduce the averaged Mn/Fe ratio\nobserved in extremely metal-poor halo stars. In order to reproduce the observed\nMn/Fe ratio, the total neutrino energy in the supernovae should be 3 - 9 x\n10^{53} ergs. Stronger neutrino irradiation and other production sites are\nnecessary to reproduce the observed Sc/Fe and Co/Fe ratios, although these\nratios increase by the nu-process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2007 10:10:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

As\nthe included space in a HOBET (as in the shell model) is defined by the\noscillator energy, both long-distance (low-momentum) and short-distance\n(high-momentum) degrees of freedom reside in the high-energy excluded space. A\nHOBET effective interaction is developed in which a short-range\ncontact-gradient expansion is combined with an exact summation of the relative\nkinetic energy. By this means the very strong coupling of the included (P) and\nexcluded (Q) spaces by the kinetic energy is removed. One finds that the\ninterplay of QT and QV is governed by a single parameter kappa, the ratio of an\nobservable, the binding energy |E|, to a parameter in the effective theory, the\noscillator energy. Once the functional dependence on kappa is identified, the\nremaining order-by-order subtraction of the short-range physics residing in Q\nbecomes systematic and rapidly converging. Numerical calculations are used to\ndemonstrate how well the resulting expansion reproduces the running of Heff\nfrom high scales to a typical shell-model scale of 8 hbar omega. At N3LO\nvarious global properties of Heff are reproduced to a typical accuracy of\n0.01%, or about 1 keV.\n  The state-dependence of the effective interaction has been a troubling\nproblem in nuclear physics, and is embodied in the energy dependence of\nHeff(|E|) in the Bloch-Horowitz formalism. It is shown that almost all of this\nstate dependence is also extracted in the procedures followed here, isolated in\nthe analytic dependence of Heff on kappa.

These define a unique gl(2,R) connection\nwhich has totally skew symmetric torsion. This torsion splits onto the GL(2,R)\nirreducible components having respective dimensions 3 and 7.\n  We prove that on the solution space of every 5th order ODE satisfying certain\nthree nonlinear differential conditions there exists a nearly integrable\nGL(2,R) geometry such that the skew symmetric torsion of its unique gl(2,R)\nconnection is very special.

Validation is crucial as industries and governments depend\nincreasingly on predictions by computer models to justify their decisions. In\nthis article, we survey the model validation literature and propose to\nformulate validation as an iterative construction process that mimics the\nprocess occurring implicitly in the minds of scientists. We thus offer a formal\nrepresentation of the progressive build-up of trust in the model, and thereby\nreplace incapacitating claims on the impossibility of validating a given model\nby an adaptive process of constructive approximation. This approach is better\nadapted to the fuzzy, coarse-grained nature of validation. Our procedure\nfactors in the degree of redundancy versus novelty of the experiments used for\nvalidation as well as the degree to which the model predicts the observations.\nWe illustrate the new methodology first with the maturation of Quantum\nMechanics as the arguably best established physics theory and then with several\nconcrete examples drawn from some of our primary scientific interests: a\ncellular automaton model for earthquakes, an anomalous diffusion model for\nsolar radiation transport in the cloudy atmosphere, and a computational fluid\ndynamics code for the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability.
