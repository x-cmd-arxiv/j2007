We build an estimator of the CMB\nlensing potential out of optimally combined projected potential estimators to\ndifferent source redshift bins. Our estimator is most sensitive to the redshift\ndepth of the WL survey, less so to the shape noise level. Estimators built\nusing galaxy surveys like LSST and SNAP yield a 30-50% reduction in the lensing\nB-mode power. We illustrate the potential advantages of a 21-cm survey by\nconsidering a fiducial WL survey for which we take the redshift depth zmax and\nthe effective angular concentration of sources n as free parameters. For a\nnoise level of 1 muK arcmin in the polarization map itself, as projected for a\nCMBPol experiment, and a beam with FWHM=10 arcmin, we find that going to\nzmax=20 at n=100 gal/sqarcmin yields a delensing performance similar to that of\na quadratic lensing potential estimator applied to small-scale CMB maps: the\nlensing B-mode contamination is reduced by almost an order of magnitude. In\nthis case, there is also a reduction by a factor of ~4 in the detectability\nthreshold of the tensor B-mode power. At this CMB noise level, there is little\ngain from sources with zmax>20. The delensing gains are lost if the CMB beam\nexceeds ~20 arcmin. The delensing efficiency and useful zmax depend acutely on\nthe CMB map noise level, but beam sizes below 10 arcmin do not help. Delensing\nvia foreground sources does not require arcminute-resolution CMB observations,\na substantial practical advantage over the use of CMB observables for\ndelensing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2007 18:12:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The\nnominal and real pricing kernels, in terms of which the price index can be\nexpressed, are then modelled by introducing a Sidrauski-type utility function\ndepending on (a) the aggregate rate of consumption, and (b) the aggregate rate\nof real liquidity benefit conferred by the money supply.

Using our very deep, high\nangular resolution JHKsL' images obtained with NAOS-CONICA at the VLT at ESO,\nwe have successfully revealed the stellar population down to the subsolar mass\nrange in the core of the starburst cluster. The derived IMF of NGC 3603 is\nreasonably fitted by a single power law with index Gamma ~ -0.74 within a mass\nrange of 0.4 - 20 Msun, substantially flatter than the Salpeter-like IMF. A\nstrong radial steepening of the IMF is observed mainly in the inner r < 30''\nfield, indicating mass segregation in the cluster center. We estimate the total\nmass of NGC 3603 to be about 1.0 - 1.6 x 10^4 Msun. The derived core density is\n> 6 x 10^4 Msun pc^-3, an order of magnitude larger than e.g., the Orion Nebula\nCluster. The estimate of the half-mass relaxation time for solar-mass stars is\nabout 10 - 40 Myr, suggesting that the intermediate- and low-mass stars have\nnot yet been affected significantly by the dynamical relaxation in the cluster.\nThe relaxation time for the high-mass stars can be comparable to the age of the\ncluster.

Analyzing thoroughly the systematic uncertainties in our IMF\ndetermination, we conclude that the power law index of the IMF of NGC 3603 is\nGamma = -0.74^{+0.62}_{-0.47}.

The main difference is the treatment of\nstar formation and feedback, both of which were designed to be more efficient\nin the disc-dominated object. We find that the specific angular momentum of the\ndisc-dominated galaxy tracks the evolution of the angular momentum of the dark\nmatter halo very closely: the angular momentum grows as predicted by linear\ntheory until the epoch of maximum expansion and remains constant thereafter. By\ncontrast, the evolution of the angular momentum of the bulge-dominated galaxy\nresembles that of the central, most bound halo material: it also grows at first\naccording to linear theory, but 90% of it is rapidly lost as pre-galactic\nfragments, into which gas had cooled efficiently, merge, transferring their\norbital angular momentum to the outer halo by tidal effects.

We find this effect particularly important at low densities and in\nthe absence of a strong background radiation field. We find new conditions for\nstable nucleation in the n-T phase diagram. The nucleation in the non-LTE\nregions is likely to be at much slower rate than in the super-saturated vapors.\nWe evaluate the nucleation rate, warning the reader that it does depend on\npoorly substantiated properties of the macro-molecules assumed in the\ncomputation.

The general formulation is based on the requirements that\nthe cloaking occurs for all possible incident fields and that the cloaks with\nfrequency w > 0 have continuous tangential E and H fields across their outer\nsurfaces, and zero normal D and B fields at their inner material surfaces. The\ntangential-field boundary conditions at the outer surface of the cloak ensure\nzero scattered fields, and the normal-field boundary conditions at the inner\nsurface of the cloak are compatible with zero total fields inside the interior\ncavity of the cloak. For spherical cloaks, unlike cylindrical cloaks, these\nboundary conditions lead to all the tangential components of the E and H fields\nbeing continuously zero across their inner surfaces -- cylindrical cloaks\nhaving delta functions in polarization densities at their inner surfaces. For\nbodies with no interior free-space cavities, the formulation is used to derive\nnonscattering spherical and cylindrical concentrators that magnify the incident\nfields near their centers. For static fields (w = 0), the boundary value\nformulation is appropriately modified to obtain a permeability dyadic that will\ncloak magnetostatic fields. Causality conditions imply that, unlike\nmagnetostatic cloaking, electrostatic cloaking as well as low-frequency\ncloaking for w > 0 is not realizable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2007 00:05:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2007 18:47:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2007 21:30:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2007 16:29:34 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 16 Sep 2008 01:45:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-28"}

For the first time, we previously demonstrated it through\ntwo-dimensional, long-term radiation-hydrodynamic simulations. To clarify why\nthis accretion is possible, we quantitatively investigate the dynamics of a\nsimulated supercritical accretion flow with a mass accretion rate of ~10^2\nL_E/c^2 (with L_E and c being, respectively, the Eddington luminosity and the\nspeed of light). We confirm two important mechanisms underlying supercritical\ndisk accretion flow, as previously claimed, one of which is the radiation\nanisotropy arising from the anisotropic density distribution of very optically\nthick material. We qualitatively show that despite a very large radiation\nenergy density, E_0>10^2L_E/(4 pi r^2 c) (with r being the distance from the\nblack hole), the radiative flux F_0 cE_0/tau could be small due to a large\noptical depth, typically tau 10^3, in the disk. Another mechanism is photon\ntrapping, quantified by vE_0, where v is the flow velocity. With a large |v|\nand E_0, this term significantly reduces the radiative flux and even makes it\nnegative (inward) at r<70r_S, where r_S is the Schwarzschild radius. Due to the\ncombination of these effects, the radiative force in the direction along the\ndisk plane is largely attenuated so that the gravitational force barely exceeds\nthe sum of the radiative force and the centrifugal force. As a result, matter\ncan slowly fall onto the central black hole mainly along the disk plane with\nvelocity much less than the free-fall velocity, even though the disk luminosity\nexceeds the Eddington luminosity. Along the disk rotation axis, in contrast,\nthe strong radiative force drives strong gas outflows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2007 01:24:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The compiled quasars are distributed\nover wide ranges of redshift (0.06 < z < 1.08) and of luminosity (-29.8 < M_B <\n-22.1), thus representing a useful sample to investigate the line-emitting gas\nproperties in various quasar environments. The measured line strengths and\nvelocities, as functions of the quasar properties, are analyzed using\nphotoionization model calculations. We found that the flux ratio between Ca II\nand O I 8446 is hardly dependent on the redshift or luminosity, indicating\nsimilar gas density in the emission region from quasar to quasar. On the other\nhand, a scatter of the O I 11287/8446 ratios appears to imply the diversity of\nthe ionization parameter. These facts invoke a picture of the line-emitting\ngases in quasars that have similar densities and are located at regions exposed\nto various ionizing radiation fluxes.

Our method provides a\nstatistical estimator for a given signal with different strengths in a set of\nobservations to be of instrumental origin or to be intrinsic. Based on the\nspectral significance as an unbiased statistical quantity in frequency\nanalysis, Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs) of target and background light\ncurves are comparatively examined.

A cylindrical geometry is chosen for the sake of\nsimplicity.

Such enormous\npressures cause profound changes in all condensed matter properties, including\nsuperconductivity. In high pressure experiments metallic elements, Tc values\nhave been elevated to temperatures as high as 20 K for Y at 115 GPa and 25 K\nfor Ca at 160 GPa. These pressures are sufficient to turn many insulators into\nmetals and magnetics into superconductors. The changes will be particularly\ndramatic when the pressure is sufficient to break up one or more atomic shells.\nRecent results in superconductivity to Mbar pressures wll be discussed which\nexemplify the progress made in this field over the past 82 years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2007 18:13:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
