For\nall methods explored, the surface tension is calculated by approximating the\nchange in Helmholtz free energy associated with a change in interfacial area\nthrough simulation of a liquid slab at constant particle number, volume, and\ntemperature. The methods explored fall within three general classes:\nfree-energy perturbation, the Bennett acceptance-ratio scheme, and the expanded\nensemble technique.

This presents\na natural framework for resolving the disagreement between previous studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2007 17:08:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-10"}

The degree of asymmetry depends on the ratio of\nthe magnetic energy to the total energy in the bubble.

Given that the wind magnetization increases in time,\nwe thus suggest that the magnetar-driven bubble initially expands relatively\nspherically (enhancing the energy of the associated supernova) while at late\ntimes it becomes progressivelymore collimated (producing the GRB).

We analyse the dependence of the instability-driven\nquasi-periodicity on the mass (M) of the central black hole, the accretion rate\n($\\rm{\\dot{M}}$) and the viscous parameter ($\\alpha$) of the inner disk. We\nshow that in the case of Mkn~501 the first two parameters are constrained by\nvarious observational results, so that for the instability occurring within a\ntwo-temperature disk where $\\alpha=0.05-1.0$, the quasi-period is expected to\nlie within the range of 8 to 100 days, as indeed the case. In particular, for\nthe observed 23-day QPO period our model implies a viscosity coefficient\n$\\alpha \\leq 0.28$, a sub-Eddington accretion rate $\\dot{M} \\simeq 0.02\n\\dot{M}_{\\rm Edd}$ and a transition radius to the outer standard disk of $r_0\n\\sim 60 r_g$, and predicts a period variation $\\delta P/P \\sim 0.23$ due to the\nmotion of the instability region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Oct 2007 03:22:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The main aim of obtaining high\nresolution H alpha 2D velocity fields is to define more accurately the rising\npart of the rotation curves which should allow to better constrain the\nparameters of the mass distribution. The H alpha velocities were combined with\nlow resolution HI data from the literature, when available. Combining the\nkinematical data with photometric data, mass models were derived from these\nrotation curves using two different functional forms for the halo: an\nisothermal sphere and an NFW profile. For the galaxies already modeled by other\nauthors, the results tend to agree. Our results point at the existence of a\nconstant density core in the center of the dark matter halos rather than a\ncuspy core, whatever the type of the galaxy from Sab to Im. This extends to all\ntypes the result already obtained by other authors studying dwarf and LSB\ngalaxies but would necessitate a larger sample of galaxies to conclude more\nstrongly. Whatever model is used (ISO or NFW), small core radius halos have\nhigher central densities, again for all morphological types. We confirm\ndifferent halo scaling laws, such as the correlations between the core radius\nand the central density of the halo with the absolute magnitude of a galaxy:\nlow luminosity galaxies have small core radius and high central density. We\nfind that the product of the central density with the core radius of the dark\nmatter halo is nearly constant, whatever the model and whatever the absolute\nmagnitude of the galaxy. This suggests that the halo surface density is\nindependent from the galaxy type.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Oct 2007 08:13:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In our earlier studies of this region\n(Papers I, III) we find that besides the central part of N66, where the bright\nOB stellar content of the association NGC346 is concentrated, an arc-like\nnebular feature, north of the association, hosts recent star formation. This\nfeature is characterized by a high concentration of emission-line stars and\nYoung Stellar Objects, as well as embedded sources seen as IR-emission peaks\nthat coincide with young compact clusters of low-mass pre-main sequence stars.\nAll these objects indicate that the northern arc of N66 encompasses the most\ncurrent star formation event in the region. We present evidence that this star\nformation is the product of a different mechanism than that in the general area\nof the association, and that it is triggered by a wind-driven expanding HII\nregion (or bubble) blown by a massive supernova progenitor, and possibly other\nbright stars, a few Myr ago.

We find that for the same rms Mach number, compressive\nforcing produces much stronger density enhancements and larger voids compared\nto solenoidal forcing. Consequently, the Fourier spectra of density\nfluctuations are significantly steeper. This result is confirmed using the\nDelta-variance analysis, which yields power-law exponents beta~3.4 for\ncompressive forcing and beta~2.8 for solenoidal forcing. We obtain fractal\ndimension estimates from the density spectra and Delta-variance scaling, and by\nusing the box counting, mass size and perimeter area methods applied to the\nvolumetric data, projections and slices of our turbulent density fields. Our\nresults suggest that compressive forcing yields fractal dimensions\nsignificantly smaller compared to solenoidal forcing.

For finite-connectivity spin glass systems, we use\nthis free energy Boltzmann distribution to formulate the cavity approach of\nM{\\'{e}}zard and Parisi [Eur. Phys. J. B {\\bf 20}, 217 (2001)] in a slightly\ndifferent form. For the $\\pm J$ spin-glass model on a random regular graph of\ndegree K=6, the predictions of the present work agree with earlier simulational\nand theoretical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Oct 2007 14:17:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

For some complex\nsystems, the equilibrium free-energy values may follow a Gaussian distribution\nwithin an intermediate temperature range, and consequently their equilibrium\nproperties are contributed by {\\em excited} thermodynamic states.
