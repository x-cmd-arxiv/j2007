However, interpretation of data drawn from Lya alone hinges on the Lya\nescape fraction which, due to the complex radiative transport, may vary\ngreatly. Here we map the Lya emission from local starburst Haro 11, a Lya\nemitter and the only known candidate for low-z Lyman continuum emission (LyC).\nTo aid in the interpretation we perform a detailed multi-wavelength analysis\nand model the stellar population, dust distribution, ionising photon budget,\nand star-cluster population. We use archival X-ray observations to further\nconstrain properties of the starburst and estimate the HI column density.\n  The Lya morphology is found to be strongly decoupled from stellar and nebular\n(H-alpha) morphologies. General surface photometry finds only very slight\ncorrelation between Lya and H-halpha, E(B-V), and stellar age. Only around the\ncentral Lya-bright cluster do we find the Lya/Ha ratio at values predicted by\nrecombination theory. The total Lya escape fraction is found to be just 3%. We\ncompute that ~90% of the Lya photons that escape do so after undergoing\nmultiple resonance scattering events, masking their point of origin. This leads\nto a largely symmetric distribution and, by increasing the distance that\nphotons must travel to escape, decreases the escape probability significantly.\nWhile dust must ultimately be responsible for the destruction of Lya, it plays\nlittle role in governing the observed morphology, which is regulated more by\nISM kinematics and geometry. We find tentative evidence for local Lya\nequivalent width in the immediate vicinity of star-clusters being a function of\ncluster age, consistent with hydrodynamic studies.

We recall some of the\nconnections between the past and the present developments. Higher homotopies\nwere isolated within algebraic topology at least as far back as the 1940's.\nPrompted by the failure of the Alexander-Whitney multiplication of cocycles to\nbe commutative, Steenrod developed certain operations which measure this\nfailure in a coherent manner. Dold and Lashof extended Milnor's classifying\nspace construction to associative H-spaces, and a careful examination of this\nextension led Stasheff to the discovery of An-spaces and Ainfty-spaces as\nnotions which control the failure of associativity in a coherent way so that\nthe classifying space construction can still be pushed through. Algebraic\nversions of higher homotopies have, as we all know, led Kontsevich eventually\nto the proof of the formality conjecture. Homological perturbation theory\n(HPT), in a simple form first isolated by Eilenberg and Mac Lane in the early\n1950's, has nowadays become a standard tool to handle algebraic incarnations of\nhigher homotopies. A basic observation is that higher homotopy structures\nbehave much better relative to homotopy than strict structures, and HPT enables\none to exploit this observation in various concrete situations which, in\nparticular, leads to the effective calculation of various invariants which are\notherwise intractable. Higher homotopies abound but they are rarely recognized\nexplicitly and their significance is hardly understood; at times, their\nappearance might at first glance even come as a surprise, for example in the\nKodaira-Spencer approach to deformations of complex manifolds or in the theory\nof foliations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Oct 2007 10:25:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-12"}

We first analyze the rigidity and\npersistence of meta-formations, which are formations obtained by connecting\nseveral rigid or persistent formations. Persistence is a generalization to\ndirected graphs of the undirected notion of rigidity. In the context of moving\nautonomous agent formations, persistence characterizes the efficacy of a\ndirected structure of unilateral distance constraints seeking to preserve a\nformation shape. We derive then, for agents evolving in a two- or\nthree-dimensional space, the conditions under which a set of persistent\nformations can be merged into a persistent meta-formation, and give the minimal\nnumber of interconnections needed for such a merging. We also give conditions\nfor a meta-formation obtained by merging several persistent formations to be\npersistent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Oct 2007 13:51:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-16"}

DMFT is by construction a local theory which\nneglects spatial correlation. Experiments have however shown that the latter is\na fundamental property of cuprate materials. In a first step, we approach the\nproblem of spatial correlation in the normal state of cuprate materials using a\nphenomenological Fermi-Liquid-Boltzmann model. We then introduce and develop in\ndetail an extension to DMFT, the Cellular Dynamical Mean Field Theory (CDMFT),\ncapable of considering short-ranged spatial correlation in a system, and we\nimplement it using the exact diagonalization algorithm . After benchmarking\nCDMFT with the exact one-dimensional solution of the Hubbard Model, we employ\nit to study the density-driven Mott metal-insulator transition in the\ntwo-dimensional Hubbard Model, focusing in particular on the anomalous\nproperties of the doped normal state close to the Mott insulator.
