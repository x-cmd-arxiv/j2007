The duality between the two types of Hardy subspaces in\nit plays the key role in the proof of all asymptotics involved.

Impacts of both\nnon-ideal channel and capture effects, specially in an environment of high\ninterference, become important in terms of the actual observed throughput. As\nfar as the 4-way handshaking mechanism is concerned, we extend the\nmulti-dimensional Markovian state transition model characterizing the behavior\nat the MAC layer by including transmission states that account for packet\ntransmission failures due to errors caused by propagation through the channel.\nThis way, any channel model characterizing the physical transmission medium can\nbe accommodated, including AWGN and fading channels. We also extend the Markov\nmodel in order to consider the behavior of the contention window when employing\nthe basic 2-way handshaking mechanism.\n  Under the usual assumptions regarding the traffic generated per node and\nindependence of packet collisions, we solve for the stationary probabilities of\nthe Markov chain and develop expressions for the saturation throughput as a\nfunction of the number of terminals, packet sizes, raw channel error rates,\ncapture probability, and other key system parameters. The theoretical\nderivations are then compared to simulation results confirming the\neffectiveness of the proposed models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Oct 2007 15:57:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}
