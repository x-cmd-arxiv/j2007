Their amplitudes result\nfrom a balance between the efficiencies of excitation and damping processes in\nthe convection zones. We develop a formalism that provides the excitation rates\nof non-radial global modes excited by turbulent convection. As a first\napplication, we estimate the impact of non-radial effects on excitation rates\nand amplitudes of high-angular-degree modes which are observed on the Sun. A\nmodel of stochastic excitation by turbulent convection has been developed to\ncompute the excitation rates, and it has been successfully applied to solar\nradial modes (Samadi & Goupil 2001, Belkacem et al. 2006b). We generalize this\napproach to the case of non-radial global modes. This enables us to estimate\nthe energy supplied to high-($\\ell$) acoustic modes. Qualitative arguments as\nwell as numerical calculations are used to illustrate the results. We find that\nnon-radial effects for $p$ modes are non-negligible:\n  - for high-$n$ modes (i.e. typically $n > 3$) and for high values of $\\ell$;\nthe power supplied to the oscillations depends on the mode inertia.\n  - for low-$n$ modes, independent of the value of $\\ell$, the excitation is\ndominated by the non-diagonal components of the Reynolds stress term. We\ncarried out a numerical investigation of high-$\\ell$ $p$ modes and we find that\nthe validity of the present formalism is limited to $\\ell < 500$ due to the\nspatial separation of scale assumption.

(2) OHM hosts are a distinct population in the\nnonlinear part of the IR-CO relation. (3) OHM hosts have exceptionally high\ndense molecular gas fractions, L(HCN)/L(CO)>0.07, and comprise roughly half of\nthis unusual population. OH absorbers and kilomasers generally follow the\nlinear IR-CO relation and are uniformly distributed in dense gas fraction and\nL(HCN), demonstrating that OHMs are independent of OH abundance. The fraction\nof non-OHMs with high mean densities and high dense gas fractions constrains\nbeaming to be a minor effect: OHM emission solid angle must exceed 2 pi\nsteradians. Contrary to conventional wisdom, IR luminosity does not dictate OHM\nformation; both star formation and OHM activity are consequences of tidal\ndensity enhancements accompanying galaxy interactions. The OHM fraction in\nstarbursts is likely due to the fraction of mergers experiencing a temporal\nspike in tidally driven density enhancement. OHMs are thus signposts marking\nthe most intense, compact, and unusual modes of star formation in the local\nuniverse. Future high redshift OHM surveys can now be interpreted in a star\nformation and galaxy evolution context, indicating both the merging rate of\ngalaxies and the burst contribution to star formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2007 19:48:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We examine many possible observational biases which could\naffect the rate determination, and conclude that none of them is likely to\nsignificantly alter the results. We investigate how the rate is related to\nseveral properties of the parent galaxies, and find that cluster membership,\nmorphology and radio power all affect the SN rate, while galaxy mass has no\nmeasurable effect. The increased rate may be due to galaxy interactions in\nclusters, inducing either the formation of young stars or a different evolution\nof the progenitor binary systems.\n  We present the first measurement of the core-collapse SN rate in cluster\nlate-type galaxies, which turns out to be comparable to the rate in field\ngalaxies. This suggests that no large systematic difference in the initial mass\nfunction exists between the two environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2007 12:34:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

We present\nhere the results of a thorough study of high-resolution multi-line observations\ntaken with the new spectro-polarimeter SPINOR, comprising the 5250 and 6302 \\AA\nspectral domains.

In general, one\nneeds to resort to inversion algorithms, ideally with realistic\nmagneto-hydrodynamical constrains.

Folkes et al. identified this\nsource as a high proper motion L9+/-1 dwarf based on its strong H2O absorption\nat 1.4 micron. We find that the optical spectrum of 2MASS J1126-5003 is in fact\nconsistent with that of a normal L4.5 dwarf with notably enhanced FeH\nabsorption at 9896 A. However, its near-infrared spectrum is unusually blue,\nwith strong H2O and weak CO bands similar in character to several recently\nidentified ``blue L dwarfs''. Using 2MASS J1126-5003 as a case study, and\nguided by trends in the condensate cloud models of Burrows et al. and Marley et\nal., we find that the observed spectral peculiarities of these sources can be\nadequately explained by the presence of thin and/or large-grained condensate\nclouds as compared to normal field L dwarfs. Atypical surface gravities or\nmetallicities alone cannot reproduce the observed peculiarities, although they\nmay be partly responsible for the unusual condensate properties. We also rule\nout unresolved multiplicity as a cause for the spectral peculiarities of 2MASS\nJ1126-5003. Our analysis is supported by examination of Spitzer mid-infrared\nspectral data from Cushing et al. which show that bluer L dwarfs tend to have\nweaker 10 micron absorption, a feature tentatively associated with silicate\noxide grains. With their unique spectral properties, blue L dwarfs like 2MASS\nJ1126-5003 should prove useful in studying the formation and properties of\ncondensates and condensate clouds in low temperature atmospheres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2007 02:39:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

A powerful tool in the\ndescription of heavy fermion metals is the large N expansion, which expands the\nphysics in powers of 1/N about a solvable limit where particles carry a large\nnumber (N) of spin components. As it stands, this method is unable to jointly\ndescribe the spin quenching and superconductivity which develop in PuCoGa_{5}\nand NpPd_{5}Al_{2}. Here, we solve this problem with a new class of large N\nexpansion that employs the symplectic symmetry of spin to protect the odd\ntime-reversal parity of spin and sustain Cooper pairs as well-defined singlets.\nWith this method we show that when a lattice of magnetic ions exchange spin\nwith their metallic environment in two distinct symmetry channels, they are\nable to simultaneously satisfy both channels by forming a condensate of\ncomposite pairs between between local moments and electrons. In the tetragonal\ncrystalline environment relevant to PuCoGa_{5} and NpPd_{5}Al_{2} the lattice\nstructure selects a natural pair of spin exchange channels, giving rise to the\nprediction of a unique anisotropic paired state with g-wave symmetry. This\npairing mechanism predicts a large upturn in the NMR relaxation rate above\nT_{c}, a strong enhancement of Andreev reflection in tunneling measurements and\nan enhanced superconducting transition temperature T_{c} in Pu doped\nNp_{1-x}Pu_{x}Pd_{5}Al_{2}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2007 03:24:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Mar 2008 18:35:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-02"}

We divided the observed region into two parts, the north path and\nthe south path, and studied the X-ray spectra along two paths. The spectra can\nbe well fitted either by a one-component non-equilibrium ionization (NEI) model\nor by a two-component NEI model. The rim regions can be well fitted by a\none-component model with relatively low \\kTe whose metal abundances are\nsub-solar (0.1--0.2). The major part of the paths requires a two-component\nmodel. Due to projection effects, we concluded that the low kTe (about 0.2 keV)\ncomponent surrounds the high kTe (about 0.6 keV) component, with the latter\nhaving relatively high metal abundances (about 5 times solar). Since the Cygnus\nLoop is thought to originate in a cavity explosion, the low-kTe component\noriginates from the cavity wall while the high-kTe component originates from\nthe ejecta. The flux of the cavity wall component shows a large variation along\nour path. We found it to be very thin in the south-west region, suggesting a\nblowout along our line of sight. The metal distribution inside the ejecta shows\nnon-uniformity, depending on the element. O, Ne and Mg are relatively more\nabundant in the outer region while Si, S and Fe are concentrated in the inner\nregion, with all metals showing strong asymmetry. This observational evidence\nimplies an asymmetric explosion of the progenitor star. The abundance of the\nejecta also indicates the progenitor star to be about 15 M_sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2007 05:45:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Although much progress has been made in recent years,\nsome open questions remain. Even at zero density, the order of the transition\nfor two light flavors of fermions has not yet been conclusively established.\nWhile considerable evidence exists in favor of a second-order transition for\nmassless quarks and a crossover for massive quarks, some recent results with\ntwo flavors of staggered fermions suggest a transition of first order.\n  Since lattice simulations are performed in finite simulation volumes, actual\nphase transitions cannot be observed directly. Thus, finite-size scaling is a\nvery useful tool in the analysis of lattice data. By comparing the scaling\nbehavior of observables to the expected scaling properties, values of critical\nexponents can be confirmed and the order as well as the universality class of a\ntransition can be established.

Two main hypotheses have been\nproposed to date: the sudden accretion by the compact object of small ejections\noriginating in a clumpy wind from the supergiant donor, or outbursts produced\nat (or near) the periastron passage in wide and eccentric orbits, in order to\nexplain the low (1E32 erg/s) quiescent emission.Neither proposed mechanisms\nseem to explain the whole phenomenology of these sources. Here we propose a new\nexplanation for the outburst mechanism, based on new X-ray observations of the\nunique SFXT known to display periodic outbursts, IGRJ11215-5952. We performed\nthree Target of Opportunity observations with Swift, XMM-Newton and INTEGRAL at\nthe time of the fifth outburst, expected on 2007 February 9. Swift observations\nof the February 2007 outburst have been reported elsewhere. Another ToO with\nSwift was performed in July 2007, in order to monitor the supposed ``apastron''\npassage. A second unexpected outburst was discovered on 2007 July 24, after\nabout 165 days from the February 2007 outburst. The new X-ray observations\nallow us to propose an alternative hypothesis for the outburst mechanism in\nSFXTs, linked to the possible presence of a second wind component,in the form\nof an equatorial disk from the supergiant donor. We discuss the applicability\nof the model to the short outburst durations of all other SFXTs, where a clear\nperiodicity in the outbursts has not been found yet. The new outburst from\nIGRJ11215-5952 observed in July suggests that the true orbital period is\n~165days, instead of 329days, as previously thought.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2007 10:26:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The new radio data\nconfirm the triple radio structure with a central core and two resolved radio\nlobes. This implies that the previously detected fast outflow of neutral gas is\noccurring off-nucleus, near a radio lobe about 0.5 kpc from the core. The\nionised gas shows complex kinematics in the region co-spatial with the radio\nemission. Broad and blueshifted (~ 500 km/s) emission is observed in the region\nof the radio lobe, at the same location as the blueshifted HI absorption. The\nvelocity of the ionised outflow is similar to the one found in HI. The first\norder correspondence between the radio and optical properties suggests that the\noutflow is driven by the interaction between the radio jet and the ISM. Despite\nthe high outflow velocities, no evidence is found for the ionisation of the gas\nbeing due to fast shocks in the region of the outflow, indicating that\nphotoionisation from the AGN is likely to be the dominant ionisation mechanism.\nThe outflow rate of the warm (ionised) gas is small compared to that of the\ncold gas.

In IC5063, the outflows may have\nsufficient kinetic power to have a significant impact on the evolution of the\nISM in the host galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2007 11:13:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The problem has the structure\nof a Constrained Markov Decision Problem (CMDP). Determining an optimal policy\nunder for the CMDP faces the problems of state space explosion and unknown\nsystem statistics. To tackle the problem of state space explosion, we suggest\ndetermining the transmission rate of a particular user in each slot based on\nits channel condition and buffer occupancy only.

Marginal evidence for variability of the\npower law photon index over the pulse period was identified, similar to that\nobserved from other X-ray pulsars. If this variability is real it can be\nattributed to a varying viewing geometry of the accretion region with the spin\nof the neutron star. Variability of the neutral hydrogen column density over\nthe orbital period was observed, which we attribute to the line of sight motion\nof the neutron star through the dense circumstellar environment. A reduction in\nthe power law photon index was observed during the orbital maximum, which we\nspeculate is due to absorption effects as the neutron star passes behind a\nheavily absorbing region near the base of the supergiant companion's wind. No\nsignificant variability of the column density was observed over the\nsuper-orbital period, indicating that variable obscuration by a precessing warp\nin an accretion disc is not the mechanism behind the super-orbital modulation.\nIn contrast, a significant increase in the power law photon index was observed\nduring the super-orbital minimum.

This phenomenon, called glass transition, is\ncharacterized by a marked increase of viscosity, about 14 orders of magnitude,\nin a narrow temperature interval. The microscopic mechanism behind the glass\ntransition is still poorly understood. However, recently, great advances have\nbeen made in the identification of cooperative rearranging regions, or\ndynamical heterogeneities, i.e. domains of the liquid whose relaxation is\nhighly correlated. The growth of the size of these domains is now believed to\nbe the driving mechanism for the increase of the viscosity. Recently a tool to\nquantify the size of these domains has been proposed. We apply this tool to a\nwide class of materials to investigate the correlation between the size of the\nheterogeneities and their configurational entropy, i.e. the number of states\naccessible to a correlated domain. We find that the relaxation time of a given\nsystem, apart from a material dependent pre-factor, is a universal function of\nthe configurational entropy of a correlated domain. As a consequence, we find\nthat at the glass transition temperature, the size of the domains and the\nconfigurational entropy per unit volume are anti-correlated, as originally\npredicted by the Adam-Gibbs theory.
