We calculate several differential distributions in $t_1,\nt_2, y, \\phi$, as well as transverse momentum distributions of $J/\\Psi$'s. We\ndiscuss correlations in the azimuthal angle between outgoing protons or proton\nand antiproton as well as in the ($t_1, t_2$) space. Differently from\nelectroproduction experiments, here both colliding beam particles can be a\nsource of photons, and we find large interference terms in azimuthal angle\ndistributions in a broad range of rapidities of the produced meson. We also\ninclude the spin--flip parts in the electromagnetic vertices. We discuss the\neffect of absorptive corrections on various distributions. Interestingly,\nabsorption corrections induce a charge asymmetry in rapidity distributions, and\nare larger for $p p$ reactions than for the $p \\bar p$ case. The reaction\nconsidered here constitutes an important nonreduceable background in recently\nproposed searches for odderon exchange.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 May 2007 19:57:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2007 10:03:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

These issues arise in condensed matter\nphysics in the context of transport of spins in the presence of spin orbit\ncoupling: the Pauli Hamiltonian governing the leading relativistic corrections\nin condensed matter systems can be rewritten in a language of SU(2) covariant\nderivatives, where the role of the non-Abelian gauge fields is taken by the\nphysical electromagnetic fields. Taking a similar perspective as Jackiw and\ncoworkers, we show that non-abelian hydrodynamical currents can be factored in\na non-coherent 'classical' part, and a coherent part requiring macroscopic\nnon-abelian quantum entanglement. Non-abelian flow being thus a much richer\naffair than familiar hydrodynamics, permits us to classify the various spin\ntransport phenomena in in condensed matter physics in a unifying framework.In\nsemiconductor spintronics, the absence of hydrodynamics is well known, but in\nour formulation it is directly associated with the fact that non-abelian\ncurrents are only covariantly conserved.We analyze the quantum mechanical\nsingle particle currents of relevance to mesoscopic transport with as highlight\nthe Aharonov-Casher effect, where we demonstrate that the non-abelian transport\nstructure renders it much more fragile than its abelian counterpart, the\nAharonov-Bohm effect.

METHODS: We use the X-ray spectral\nanalysis to assess the presence of an AGN in these sources and to characterize\nits properties. RESULTS: We detect AGN activity in 33 out of 35 sources. The\nremaining 2 sources are the ones with the lowest X-ray luminosity in the sample\n(L[2-10keV]<10^41 erg s^-1) and their X-ray emission could be produced within\nthe host galaxy. We find that the ``recognition problem'' for AGN is very\ncritical in the low-luminosity regime (at least 60% of the AGN with\nL[2-10keV]<10^43 erg s^-1 are elusive) becoming negligible for high X-ray\nluminosities (~1.5% of elusive AGN with L[2-10keV]>10^44 erg s^-1). This\nproblem affects mostly absorbed AGN (~40% of type~2 AGN in the survey are\nelusive) but also a significant fraction of unabsorbed AGN (8%). CONCLUSIONS:\nWe find that the simplest explanations of why these 33 (or most of them) AGNs\nare elusive are two: at low X-ray luminosities (<10^43 erg s^-1) the most\nimportant reason is the intrinsically low AGN/galaxy contrast (optical\ndilution) while at high luminosities (>10^44 erg s^-1) it is due to the optical\nabsorption (in the Compton-thin regime, i.e. NH<10^24 cm^-2). Alternative\nhypotheses, like the presence of Compton-thick sources, BL Lac objects or\n``non-standard'' AGN (e.g. with alpha_OX<1 or with weak/absorbed Narrow Line\nRegion) are not supported by the data although we cannot exclude the presence\nin the sample of a few sources of these types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2007 14:13:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The layered film structure was characterized as p-type magnetic\nsemiconductor at $300 ^oK$ with a carrier density of the order of $10^{20}\n/cm^3$. The undoped pure TiO$_{2-\\delta}$ film was characterized as an n-type\nmagnetic semiconductor. The hole carriers were excited at the interface between\nthe granular Fe and TiO$_{2-\\delta}$ layers similar to holes excited in the\nmetal/n-type semiconductor interface commonly observed in\nMetal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) devices. The holes at the interface were\npolarized in an applied magnetic field raising the possibility that these\ngranular MOS structures can be utilized for practical spintronic device\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2007 14:51:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In\nprevious papers we proposed a Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the nonequilibrium\nfree energy as a basic principle of nonequilibrium thermodynamics.

In contrast with fluctuating\nhydrodynamics, this approach can be used to derive equations for correlations\nof any order. Generically, the solutions of the equation for the correlation\nfunctions are non-trivial and show that long range correlations are indeed a\ncommon feature of nonequilibrium systems. Finally, we establish a criterion to\ndetermine whether the local thermodynamic variables are positively or\nnegatively correlated in terms of properties of the transport coefficients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2007 15:10:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-18"}
