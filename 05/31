Though\na previous study using a hierarchical clustering model simply assumed a\nconstant and universal value of f_esc, we incorporate two new effects on f_esc:\nextinction by interstellar dust and galaxy-scale outflow induced as a star\nformation feedback.

Our model\npredicts that galaxies with strong outflows and f_esc ~ 1 are dominant in the\nobserved LFs. This is also consistent with available observations, while the\nsimple universal f_esc model requires f_esc << 1 not to overproduce the\nbrightest LAEs. On the other hand, we found that our model significantly\noverpredicts LAEs at z > 6, and absorption of Lya photons by neutral hydrogen\nin intergalactic medium (IGM) is a reasonable interpretation for the\ndiscrepancy.

For relatively short periods and small enough amplitudes the\nsystem becomes trapped either at low or high Ag coverage states, as evidenced\nby recording hysteresis loops. This scenario is identified as dynamically\nordered states (DOS), such that the relaxation time $(\\tau_{relax})$ of the\ncorresponding metastable state obeys $\\tau_{relax} > \\tau $. On the other hand,\nby properly increasing $\\mu_{o}$ or/and $\\tau$, one finds that the $Ag$\ncoverage gently follows the external drive (here $\\tau_{relax} < \\tau $) and\nthe system is said to enter into dynamically disordered states (DDS), where\nhysteresis loops show almost symmetric limiting cycles. This symmetry breaking\nbetween limiting cycles driven by an external signal is discussed in terms of\nthe concept of (out-of-equilibrium) Dynamic Phase Transitions between DOS and\nDDS, similar to those encountered when a magnetic system is placed in the\npresence of a variable external magnetic field. However, a careful finite-size\nscaling study reveals that, at least at $T = 300K$, the $Ag/Au(100)$ system\ndoes not exhibit true second-order phase transitions but rather a crossover\nbehavior between states. A diagram showing the location of the ordered and\ndisordered states in the $\\mu$ versus $\\tau$ plane is obtained and discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 May 2007 20:21:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-01"}

Thus these breakdowns appear to be generalized\nphenomena, in contrast with the view where only the most mobile molecules are\nthe origin of the breakdown of the SE and SED relations, embedded in an\ninactive background where these relations hold. At low temperature, the SE and\nSED relations in both subsets of molecules are replaced with ``fractional'' SE\nand SED relations, $D_t\\sim(\\tau/T)^{-\\xi_t}$ and $D_r\\sim(\\tau/T)^{-\\xi_r}$\nwhere $\\xi_t\\approx0.84<1$ and $\\xi_r\\approx0.75<1$.

This has\nimportance, for example, in quantum mechanics, random matrix theory and fluid\ndynamics.\n  The occurence of pseudospectra for non-selfadjoint semiclassical differential\noperators is due to the existence of quasimodes, i.e., approximate local\nsolutions to the eigenvalue problem.

The group $SO(3)_{F}$ is treated as a chiral gauged flavour\nsymmetry. Electroweak-, flavour- and Higgs interactions are unified in one\nsingle gauge group SU(7) which is broken again down to $G_{SM}^{ex}$ by\norbifolding and imposing additional boundary conditions. The compactification\nscale is O(1) TeV. The orbifold $S^{1}/Z_{2}$ is put on a lattice. This setting\ngives a staring point for RG-transformations. As a result the bulk is\nintegrated out and the extra dimension consist of only two points: the orbifold\nfixed points. Parallel transporters (PT) in the extra dimension become\nnonunitary as a result of the blockspin transformations. In addition, a Higgs\npotential emerges naturally. The PTs can be written as a product $e^{A_{y}}\ne^{\\eta} e^{A_{y}}$ of unitary factors $e^{A_{y}}$ and a selfadjoint factor\n$e^{\\eta}$. The reduction $48 \\to 35 + 6 + \\bar{6} + 1$ of the adjoint reps of\nSU(7) with respect to $SU(6) \\supset G_{SM}^{ex}$ leads to three $SU(2)_{L}$\nHiggs doublets: one for each flavour.

This\nbreaking leads to $SO(3)_{F}$ flavour gauge boson masses much above the\ncompactification scale. Thus tree-level FCNC are naturally suppressed. Making\nsome simplifying assumptions we also calculate fermion masses and CKM mixing\nangles. As for the gauge bosons an exponential fermion mass splitting occurs\nnaturally. The model predicts a large Higgs sector consisting of 30 Higgs\nparticles and in its simplest form the weak mixing angle $\\theta=0.125$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 May 2007 10:48:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-01"}

Five\nangularly large Virgo Cluster spiral galaxies (NGC 4501, NGC 4438, NGC 4535,\nNGC 4548 and NGC 4654) were the targets for a sensitive total power and\npolarization study using the 100-m radio telescope in Effelsberg at 4.85 GHz.\nFor two objects polarization data at higher frequencies have been obtained\nallowing Faraday rotation analysis.

For some galaxies they agree with observations of\nother species, but sometimes (NGC 4535) the magnetic field is the only tracer\nof the interaction with the cluster environment.

Such a low M_max,\ndue to a kaon condensation in the stellar core, implies collapse of a too\nmassive deleptonized protoneutron star into a black hole. This would naturally\nexplain the lack of a neutron star in the SN1987A remnant. On the other hand,\nrecent evaluation of mass of PSR J0751+1807 gives M_max > 2M_sun. This\ncontradicts the original Bethe-Brown model, but can be reconciled within\nscenarios proposed in the present Letter. We consider two types of dense matter\nmodels with high-density softening, due to a transition from a non-strange\nN-phase of matter to a strangeness carrying phase S: kaon condensation and\ndeconfinement of quarks. Two scenarios of neutron star formation in stellar\ncore collapse are considered. In the first scenario, realized in sufficiently\nhot and dense supernova cores, nucleation of an S-phase is sufficiently rapid\nso as to form an S-phase core, and implying M_max = M^S_max =~ 1.5M_sun. In the\nsecond scenario, nucleation of the S-phase at neutron star birth is too slow to\nmaterialize, and the star becomes cold without forming an S-phase core. Then,\nstellar mass can increase via accretion, until central density \\rho_crit is\nreached, and the S phase forms. This N branch of neutron stars ends at\nM=M_crit. We select several models of N-phase satifying the necessary condition\nM^N_max > 2M_sun and combine them with models of kaon condensation and quark\ndeconfinement. For kaon condensation, we get M_crit =~ M^S_max =~ 1.5M_sun,\nwhich is ruled out by PSR J0751+1807.

The chain size, studied by the radius of gyration, shows\nthree different variational behaviors with salt concentration, depending on the\nchain stiffness. According to these behaviors, polyelectrolytes of fixed chain\nlength are classified into three categories: flexible chain, semiflexible\nchain, and rigid chain. The worm-like chain model with persistence length\npredicted by the Odijk-Skolnick-Fixman theory is found to be able to\nqualitatively describe the end-to-end distance at low salt concentration. In a\nlow-salt region, a flexible polyelectrolyte extends more significantly than a\nsemiflexible chain, and in a high-salt region, regardless of chain stiffness, a\nchain attains a dimension comparable to that of its neutral polymer. The chain\nstiffness influences both the local and the global chain structures. A flexible\nchain exhibits a zigzagged local structure in the presence of salt ions and the\ncondensed structure is a disordered, random globule. A semiflexible chain is\nlocally smooth, and the condensed structure is orderly packed, taking a form\nsuch as hairpin or toroid. Moreover, the chain stiffness can also affect the\nnature of the coil-globule transition. The transition is occurred in a discrete\nmanner for semiflexible chain, whereas in a continuous way for flexible chain.\nThis discrete feature is happened not only at low salt concentration when a\nsemiflexible chain is collapsed, but also at high salt concentration when the\ncollapsed chain is reexpanded. At the end, the effects of chain stiffness and\nsalt concentration on the conformation of single polyelectrolytes are\nsummarized in a schematic state diagram.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 May 2007 01:13:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

The concept\nof selective control is developed using cell death or apoptosis in\nheterogeneous cell populations as an example. Apoptosis signaling in\nheterogeneous cells is described by an ensemble of gene networks with identical\ntopology but different link strengths. Selective control depends on the\nstatistics of signaling in the ensemble of networks and we analyse the effects\nof superposition, non-linearity and feedback on these statistics. Parallel\npathways promote normal statistics while series pathways promote skew\ndistributions which in the most extreme cases become log-normal. We also show\nthat feedback and non-linearity can produce bimodal signaling statistics, as\ncan discreteness and non-linearity. Two methods for optimizing selective\ncontrol are presented. The first is an exhaustive search method and the second\nis a linear programming based approach. Though control of a single gene in the\nsignaling network yields little selectivity, control of a few genes typically\nyields higher levels of selectivity. The statistics of gene combinations\nsusceptible to selective control is studied and is used to identify general\ncontrol strategies. We found that selectivity is promoted by acting on the\nleast sensitive nodes in the case of weak populations, while selective control\nof robust populations is optimized through perturbations of more sensitive\nnodes. High throughput experiments with heterogeneous cell lines could be\ndesigned in an analogous manner, with the further possibility of incorporating\nthe selectivity optimization process into a closed-loop control system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 May 2007 15:51:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-29"}
