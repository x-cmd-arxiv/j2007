The lens reconstruction of the UV morphology of the LBG\nindicates that it comprises two components separated by ~2 kpc. The CO emission\nis unresolved, and appears to be centered on the intrinsically fainter (and\nalso less highly magnified) of the two UV components. The width of the CO line\nindicates a dynamical mass of (8+/-2)x10^9csc(i)^2 Mo within the central 2 kpc.\nEmploying mid-infrared observations from Spitzer we derive a stellar mass of\n~(6+/-2)x10^9 Mo and a star-formation rate of ~60 Mo/yr, indicating that the\nmolecular gas will be consumed in ~40 Myr. The gas fractions, star-formation\nefficiencies and line widths suggests that LBGJ213512 is a high-redshift,\ngas-rich analog of a local luminous infrared galaxy. This galaxy has a similar\ngas-to-dynamical mass fraction as observed in the submillimeter-selected\npopulation, although the gas surface density and star-formation efficiency is a\nfactor of 3x less, suggesting less vigorous activity. We discuss the\nuncertainties in our conclusions arising from adopting a CO-to-H2 conversion\nfactor appropriate for either the Milky Way or local luminous infrared\ngalaxies. These observations demonstrate that current facilities, when aided by\nfortuitous gravitational magnification, can study 'ordinary' galaxies at\nhigh-redshift and so act as pathfinders for ALMA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 May 2007 20:35:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

The charge transfer inefficiency (CTI) in\neach CCD column (vertical transfer channel) is measured by the injection of\ncharge packets into a transfer channel and subsequent readout. This paper\nreports the performances of the charge injection capability based on the ground\nexperiments using a radiation damaged device, and in-orbit measurements of the\nXIS. The ground experiments show that charges are stably injected with the\ndispersion of 91eV in FWHM in a specific column for the charges equivalent to\nthe X-ray energy of 5.1keV. This dispersion width is significantly smaller than\nthat of the X-ray events of 113eV (FWHM) at approximately the same energy. The\namount of charge loss during transfer in a specific column, which is measured\nwith the charge injection capability, is consistent with that measured with the\ncalibration source. These results indicate that the charge injection technique\ncan accurately measure column-dependent charge losses rather than the\ncalibration sources. The column-to-column CTI correction to the calibration\nsource spectra significantly reduces the line widths compared to those with a\ncolumn-averaged CTI correction (from 193eV to 173eV in FWHM on an average at\nthe time of one year after the launch).

It is however well known that the dynamics of the\nmagnetic field is linked to that of the velocity field in the core and any\nattempt to model secular variations will involve a coupled dynamical system for\nmagnetic field and core velocity. Unfortunately, there is no direct observation\nof the velocity. Independently of the exact nature of the above-mentioned\ncoupled system -- some version being currently under construction -- the\nquestion is debated in this paper whether good knowledge of the magnetic field\ncan be translated into good knowledge of core dynamics. Furthermore, what will\nbe the impact of the most recent and precise geomagnetic data on our knowledge\nof the geomagnetic field of the past and future? These questions are cast into\nthe language of variational data assimilation, while the dynamical system\nconsidered in this paper consists in a set of two oversimplified\none-dimensional equations for magnetic and velocity fields. This toy model\nretains important features inherited from the induction and Navier-Stokes\nequations: non-linear magnetic and momentum terms are present and its linear\nresponse to small disturbances contains Alfv\\'en waves. It is concluded that\nvariational data assimilation is indeed appropriate in principle, even though\nthe velocity field remains hidden at all times; it allows us to recover the\nentire evolution of both fields from partial and irregularly distributed\ninformation on the magnetic field.
