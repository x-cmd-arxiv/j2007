The model is based on height-integrated hydrodynamic equations,\nalpha-viscosity, and a pseudo-Newtonian potential that results in an innermost\nstable circular orbit (ISCO) that closely approximates the one predicted by GR.\nWe find that the hydrodynamic models exhibit increasing deviations from the\nstandard disk model of Shakura & Sunyaev as disk thickness H/R or the value of\nalpha increases. The latter is an analytical model in which the viscous torque\nis assumed to vanish at the ISCO. We consider the implications of the results\nfor attempts to estimate black hole spin by using the standard disk model to\nfit continuum spectra of black hole accretion disks. We find that the error in\nthe spin estimate is quite modest so long as H/R < 0.1 and alpha < 0.2. At\nworst the error in the estimated value of the spin parameter is 0.1 for a\nnon-spinning black hole; the error is much less for a rapidly spinning hole. We\nalso consider the density and disk thickness contrast between the gas in the\ndisk and that inside the ISCO. The contrast needs to be large if black hole\nspin is to be successfully estimated by fitting the relativistically-broadened\nX-ray line profile of fluorescent iron emission from reflection off an\naccretion disk. In our hydrodynamic models, the contrast in density and\nthickness is low when H/R>0.1, sugesting that the iron line technique may be\nmost reliable in extemely thin disks.

At the time of observation, AR 8375 was young, AR 0330\nmature, and AR 9575 decaying. The vertical velocity indicates that the elements\nof MMF pairs with polarity opposite to that of the sunspot support a downflow\nof around 50-100 m s$^{-1}$. The average Doppler shift difference between\nnegative and positive elements of an MMF pair is about 150 m s$^{-1}$ in AR\n8375, 100 m s$^{-1}$ in AR 0330, and 20 m s$^{-1}$ in AR 9575. These\nobservational results are in agreement with the model that MMF pairs are part\nof a U-loop emanating from the sunspot's magnetic canopy. According to this\nmodel the downflow is caused by the Evershed flow returning below the solar\nsurface. For AR 8375, the horizontal velocity of MMFs ranges from 0.1 km\ns$^{-1}$ to 0.7 km s$^{-1}$, and on average, the velocity of an MMF pair\ndecreases significantly (from 0.6 km s$^{-1}$ to 0.35 km s$^{-1}$) with\nincreasing distance from the MMF's birth place. This result suggests that the\nchange in MMF flow speed does not reflect the radial structure of the moat\nflow, but rather is intrinsic to the evolution of the MMF pairs. This result is\nalso in agreement with the U-loop model of MMF pairs. We also find that\nproperties of MMF pairs, most strikingly the lifetime, depend on the evolution\nstages of the parent sunspot. The mean lifetimes of MMF pairs in ARs 9575 and\n0330 are 0.7 hours and 1.6 hours, respectively, which is considerably shorter\nthan the 4 hours lifetime previously found for AR 8375.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 May 2007 10:06:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Most of the crystals investigated are elemental\n(e.g., germanium) or binary (e.g., gallium nitride) semiconductors. The initial\nelectronic calculations were performed in the local density approximation and\ndid not include spin-orbit interaction. Agreement between experimental and\ncalculated results was usually found to be good, except for crystals containing\nheavy atoms (e.g., PbS) for which discrepancies of the order of 20% existed at\nthe low temperature maximum found for $C/T^3$. It has been conjectured that\nthis discrepancies result from the neglect of spin-orbit interaction which is\nlarge for heavy atoms ($\\Delta_0\\sim$1.3eV for the $p$ valence electrons of\natomic lead). Here we discuss measurements and \\textit{ab initio} calculations\nof $C(T)$ for crystalline bismuth ($\\Delta_0\\sim$1.7 eV), strictly speaking a\nsemimetal but in the temperature region accessible to us ($T >$ 2K) acting as a\nsemiconductor. We extend experimental data available in the literature and\nnotice that the \\textit{ab initio} calculations without spin-orbit interaction\nexhibit a maximum at $\\sim$8K, about 20% lower than the measured one. Inclusion\nof spin-orbit interaction decreases the discrepancy markedly: The maximum of\n$C(T)$ is now only 7% larger than the measured one. Exact agreement is obtained\nif the spin-orbit hamiltonian is reduced by a factor of $\\sim$0.8.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 May 2007 15:13:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
