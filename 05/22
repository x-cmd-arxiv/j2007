Two-Time Physics has shown\nthat the Standard Model of Particles and Forces is successfully reproduced by a\ntwo-time field theory in 4 space and 2 time dimensions projected as a\nholographic image on an emergent spacetime in 3+1 dimensions. Among the\nsuccesses of this approach is the resolution of the strong CP problem of QCD as\nan outcome of the restrictions imposed by the higher symmetry structures in 4+2\ndimensions. In this paper we launch a program to construct the duals of the\nStandard Model as other holographic images of the same 4+2 dimensional theory\non a variety of emergent spacetimes in 3+1 dimensions. These dual field\ntheories are obtained as a family of gauge choices in the master 4+2 field\ntheory. In the present paper we deal with some of the simpler gauge choices\nwhich lead to interacting Klein-Gordon field theories for the conformal scalar\nwith a predicted SO(d,2) symmetry in a variety of interesting curved spacetimes\nin (d-1)+1 dimensions. More challenging and more interesting gauge choices\n(including some that relate to mass) which are left to future work are also\noutlined. Through this approach we discover a new realm of previously\nunexplored dualities and hidden symmetries that exist both in the macroscopic\nand microscopic worlds, at the classical and quantum levels. Such phenomena\npredicted by 2T-physics can in principle be confirmed both by theory and\nexperiment. 1T-physics can be used to analyze the predictions but in most\ninstances gives no clue that the predicted phenomena exist in the first place.\nThis point of view suggests a new paradigm for the construction of a\nfundamental theory that is likely to impact on the quest for unification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2007 19:19:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

This spectral transformation is a process\nstarted at early epochs and continuing efficiently down to the local Universe.\nThis is confirmed by the evolution of our type-dependent stellar mass function.\nThe underlying stellar ages of LT galaxies apparently do not show evolution,\nlikely as a result of a continuous formation of new stars. All star formation\nactivity indicators consistently point towards a star formation history peaked\nin the past for massive galaxies, with little or no residual star formation\ntaking place in the most recent epochs. The activity and efficiency of forming\nstars are mechanisms that depend on stellar mass, and the mass assembly becomes\nprogressively less efficient in massive systems as time elapses.

For n<=20 we provide simple analytic fitting\nformulae to describe the non-resonant part of the two-photon emission profiles.\nCombining these with the analytic form of the cascade-term yields a simple and\naccurate description of the full two-photon decay spectrum, which only involves\na sum over a few intermediate states. We demonstrate that the cascade term\nnaturally leads to a nearly Lorentzian shape of the two-photon profiles in the\nvicinity of the resonances. However, due to quantum-electrodynamical\ncorrections, the two-photon emission spectra deviate significantly from the\nLorentzian shape in the very distant wings of the resonances. We investigate up\nto which distance the two-photon profiles are close to a Lorentzian and discuss\nthe role of the interference term. We then analyze how the deviation of the\ntwo-photon profiles from the Lorentzian shape affects the dynamics of\ncosmological hydrogen recombination. Since in this context the escape of\nphotons from the Lyman-alpha resonance plays a crucial role, we concentrate on\nthe two-photon corrections in the vicinity of the Lyman-alpha line. Our\ncomputations show that the changes in the ionization history due to the\nadditional two-photon process from high shell (n>2) likely do not reach the\npercent-level. For conservative assumptions we find a correction DN_e/N_e~-0.4%\nat redshift z~1160. This is numerically similar to the result of another recent\nstudy; however, the physics leading to this conclusion is rather different. In\nparticular, our calculations of the effective two-photon decay rates yield\nsignificantly different values, where the destructive interference of the\nresonant and non-resonant terms plays a crucial role in this context (abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2007 18:37:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2008 15:21:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The fainter object, SBW2, is a more distorted ring, is N-rich, and\nhas a central star that seems to be invisible. We discuss these two new nebulae\nin context with rings around SN1987A, Sher25, HD168625, RY Scuti, WeBo1, SuWt2,\nand others. The ring bearers fall into two groups: Five rings surround hot\nsupergiants, and all except for the one known binary are carbon copies of the\nring around SN1987A. We propose a link between these rings and B[e]\nsupergiants, where the rings derive from the same material in an earlier B[e]\nphase. The remaining four rings surround evolved intermediate-mass stars; all\nmembers of this ring fellowship are close binaries, hinting that binary\ninteractions govern the forging of such rings. We estimate that there may be\nseveral thousand more dark rings in the Galaxy, but we are scarcely aware of\ntheir existence due to selection effects. The lower-mass objects might be the\nequatorial density enhancements often invoked to bind the waists of bipolar\nPNe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2007 20:44:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

We show that these planetesimals generally cannot pass through\nthe mean motion resonances of the cores, and the suppression of planetesimal\nbombardment rate enables the cores to accrete gas with little interruption.\nDuring growth from the cores to protoplanets, as the resonances overlap with\neach other, the trapped planetesimals become dynamically unstable and their\neccentricity excitation is strongly enhanced. Subsequent gas drag induces the\nplanetesimals to migrate and collide with the protoplanet. This process leads\nto the resumption and a surge of planetesimal bombardment during the advanced\nstage of the protoplanet growth.

The primary focus is the\nstudy of diffusive motion of small probe particles. Comparison is made with\nmeasurements of solution viscosities. A coherent description was obtained,\nnamely that the probe diffusion coefficient generally depends on polymer\nconcentration as D_p = D_0 exp(-alpha c^nu). One finds that alpha depends on\npolymer molecular weights as alpha ~ M^0.8, and \\nu appears to have large-M and\nsmall-M values with a crossover linking them. The probe diffusion coefficient\ndoes not simply track the solution viscosity; instead, D_p eta typically\nincreases markedly with increasing polymer concentration and molecular weight.\nIn some systems, e.g., hydroxypropylcellulose:water, the observed probe spectra\nare bi- or tri-modal. Extended analysis of the full probe phenomenology implies\nthat hydroxypropylcellulose solutions are characterized by a single,\nconcentration-independent, length scale that is approximately the size of a\npolymer coil. In a very few systems, one sees re-entrant or\nlow-concentration-plateau behaviors of uncertain interpretation; from their\nrarity, these behaviors are reasonably interpreted as corresponding to specific\nchemical effects. True microrheological studies examining the motion of\nmesoscopic particles under the influence of a known external force are also\nexamined. Viscosity from true microrheological measurements is in many cases\nsubstantially smaller than the viscosity measured with a macroscopic\ninstrument.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2007 15:45:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
