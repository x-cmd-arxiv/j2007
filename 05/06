An ideal star in our terminology has\nspherical symmetry and an isentropic equation of state. In our first work on\nthis subject it was assumed that the density vanishes beyond a finite distance\nfrom the origin. But it is difficult to decide what the proper boundary\nconditions should be and we are consequently skeptical of the concept of a\nfixed boundary. In this paper we investigate the double polytrope,\ncharacterized by a polytropic index n less than 5 in the bulk of the star and a\nvalue larger than 5 in an outer atmosphere that extends to infinity. It has no\nfixed boundary but a region of critical density where the polytropic index\nchanges from a value that is appropriate for the bulk of the star to a value\nthat provides a crude model for the atmosphere. The existence of a relation\nbetween mass and radius is confirmed, as well as an upper limit on the mass.\nThe principal conclusion is that all the static configurations are stable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 May 2007 01:28:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We also show that any basis of the orthogonal complement of a\nmultipartite pure state is indistinguishable by separable operations if and\nonly if this state cannot be a superposition of 1 or 2 orthogonal product\nstates, i.e., has an orthogonal Schmidt number not less than 3, thus generalize\nthe recent work about indistinguishable bipartite subspaces [Watrous, Phys.\nRev. Lett. \\textbf{95}, 080505 (2005)]. Notably, we obtain an explicit\nconstruction of indistinguishable subspaces of dimension 7 (or 6) by\nconsidering a composite quantum system consisting of two qutrits (resp. three\nqubits), which is slightly better than the previously known indistinguishable\nbipartite subspace with dimension 8.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 May 2007 10:21:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2007 13:21:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2007 08:53:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-25"}
