The main concern of this work is to design relaying\nstrategies that utilize efficiently the relays in such a way that the diversity\nis maximized. In part I, we focus on the amplify-and-forward (AF) strategy with\nwhich the relays simply scale the received signal and retransmit it. More\nspecifically, we characterize the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) of the\nAF scheme in a general multihop channel with arbitrary number of antennas and\narbitrary number of hops. The DMT is in closed-form expression as a function of\nthe number of antennas at each node. First, we provide some basic results on\nthe DMT of the general Rayleigh product channels. It turns out that these\nresults have very simple and intuitive interpretation. Then, the results are\napplied to the AF multihop channels which is shown to be equivalent to the\nRayleigh product channel, in the DMT sense. Finally, the project-and-forward\n(PF) scheme, a variant of the AF scheme, is proposed. We show that the PF\nscheme has the same DMT as the AF scheme, while the PF can have significant\npower gain over the AF scheme in some cases. In part II, we will derive the\nupper bound on the diversity of the multihop channels and show that it can be\nachieved by partitioning the multihop channel into AF subchannels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2007 16:28:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-13"}

Pauksztello has independently introduced them as\nco-t-structures). This axiomatizes the properties of stupid truncations of\ncomplexes in $K(B)$. We also construct weight structures for Voevodsky's\ncategories of motives and for various categories of spectra. A weight structure\n$w$ defines Postnikov towers of objects; these towers are canonical and\nfunctorial 'up to morphisms that are zero on cohomology'. For $Hw$ being the\nheart of $w$ (in $DM_{gm}$ we have $Hw=Chow$) we define a canonical\nconservative 'weakly exact' functor $t$ from our $C$ to a certain weak category\nof complexes $K_w(Hw)$. For any (co)homological functor $H:C\\to A$ for an\nabelian $A$ we construct a weight spectral sequence $T:H(X^i[j])\\implies\nH(X[i+j])$ where $(X^i)=t(X)$; it is canonical and functorial starting from\n$E_2$. This spectral sequences specializes to the 'usual' (Deligne's) weight\nspectral sequences for 'classical' realizations of motives and to\nAtiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequences for spectra. Under certain restrictions,\nwe prove that $K_0(C)\\cong K_0(Hw)$ and $K_0(End C)\\cong K_0(End Hw)$.\n  The definition of a weight structure is almost dual to those of a\nt-structure; yet several properties differ. One can often construct a certain\n$t$-structure which is 'adjacent' to $w$ and vice versa. This is the case for\nthe Voevodsky's $DM^{eff}_-$ (one obtains certain new Chow weight and\nt-structures for it; the heart of the latter is 'dual' to $Chow^{eff}$) and for\nthe stable homotopy category. The Chow t-structure is closely related to\nunramified cohomology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2007 19:53:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2007 18:41:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2007 18:34:08 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 7 Jul 2008 19:41:14 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 15 Dec 2008 20:47:24 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2009 09:19:14 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Sat, 3 Jul 2010 00:25:05 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2011 20:38:49 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2016 17:09:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-21"}

Methods: The ices are grown\nunder high vacuum conditions and spectra are recorded in transmission using a\nFourier transform infrared spectrometer. Pure HCOOH ices deposited at 15 K and\n145 K are studied, as well as binary and tertiary mixtures containing H2O, CO,\nCO2 and CH3OH. The mixture concentrations are varied from 50:50% to ~10:90% for\nHCOOH:H2O.

Results: Pure HCOOH ice spectra show broad bands which\nsplit around 120 K due to the conversion of a dimer to a chain-structure. Broad\nsingle component bands are found for mixtures with H2O. Additional spectral\ncomponents are present in mixtures with CO, CO2 and CH3OH.

The Universe is considered a\nclosed system and allowed to expand adiabatically from the epoch when QSOs\nfirst ionized the IGM (5 <= z_on <= 20). The average kinetic energy of a gas is\ncalculated in the region where the gas transitions from relativistic to\nnon-relativistic behavior. All of the above measurements are then used to\ndetermine the thermal history of the IGM in the redshift range 2.5 <= z <=\nz_on. The hot IGM is assumed to inverse Compton scatter photons from the Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (CMBR) and consequently distort the CMBR as seen at the\npresent epoch. The temperature of the IGM at z=2.5 and the epoch z_on are\nadjusted, within the constraints defined above, to give the best overall\nagreement with published data on the temperature of the IGM. We find that the\nmodel of the IGM proposed here does not grossly distort the CMBR, and in fact\nagrees quite closely with the preliminary results from the Cosmic Background\nExplorer (COBE) satellite.

For subsonic motion, the density wake with a\nweak tail is simply a curved version of that in Ostriker and does not exhibit\nthe front-back symmetry. The resulting drag force in the opposite direction is\nremarkably similar to the finite-time, linear-trajectory counterpart. On the\nother hand, a supersonic perturber is able to overtake its own wake, possibly\nmultiple times, and develops a very pronounced tail. The supersonic tail\nsurrounds the perturber in a trailing spiral fashion, enhancing the perturbed\ndensity at the back as well as far front of the perturber. We provide the\nfitting formulae for the drag forces as functions of the Mach number, whose\nazimuthal part is surprisingly in good agreement with the Ostriker's formula,\nprovided Vp t=2 Rp, where Vp and Rp are the velocity and orbital radius of the\nperturber, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 May 2007 07:34:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

Four-neutrino oscillations of the (3+1) type have been only\nmarginally allowed before the recent MiniBooNE results, and become even more\ndisfavored with the new data (at the level of $4\\sigma$). In the framework of\nso-called (3+2) five-neutrino mass schemes we find severe tension between\nappearance and disappearance experiments at the level of more than $3\\sigma$,\nand hence no satistfactory fit to the global data is possible in (3+2) schemes.\nThis tension remains also when a third sterile neutrino is added, and the\nquality of the global fit does not improve significantly in a (3+3) scheme. It\nshould be noted, however, that in models with more than one sterile neutrino\nthe MiniBooNE results are in perfect agreement with the LSND appearance\nevidence, thanks to the possibility of CP violation available in such\noscillation schemes.

From the\ntransit light curve we determine that the radius of the planet is Rp =\n0.982^{+0.038}_{0.105}RJup. HD 147506b (also coined HAT-P-2b) has a mass about\n9 times the average mass of previously-known transiting exoplanets, and a\ndensity of rho = 11.9 g cm-3, greater than that of rocky planets like the\nEarth. Its mass and radius are marginally consistent with theories of structure\nof massive giant planets composed of pure H and He, and may require a large\n(~100 Earth mass) core to account for. The high eccentricity causes a 9-fold\nvariation of insolation of the planet between peri- and apastron. Using\nfollow-up photometry, we find that the center of transit is Tmid =\n2,454,212.8559 +/- 0.0007 (HJD), and the transit duration is 0.177 +/-0.002 d.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 May 2007 15:52:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2007 20:31:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
