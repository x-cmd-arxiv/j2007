However, applications of this elegant test have been\ncurtailed by two factors: our ignorance of how galaxies evolve with redshift,\nand the absence of methods to deal with the effect of incomplete information in\nlensing systems. In this paper, we investigate both issues in detail. We\nexplore how to extract the properties of evolving galaxies, assuming that the\ncosmology is well determined by other techniques. We propose a new nested Monte\nCarlo method to quantify the effects of incomplete data. We apply the\nlens-redshift test to an improved sample of seventy lens systems derived from\nrecent observations, primarily from the SDSS, SLACS and the CLASS surveys. We\nfind that the limiting factor in applying the lens-redshift test derives from\npoor statistics, including incomplete information samples, and biased sampling.\nMany lenses that uniformly sample the underlying true image separation\ndistribution will be needed to use this test as a complementary method to\nmeasure the value of the cosmological constant or the properties of evolving\ngalaxies. Planned future surveys by missions like the SNAP satellite or LSST\nare likely to usher in a new era for strong lensing studies that utilize this\ntest. With expected catalogues of thousands of new strong lenses, the\nlens-redshift test could offer a powerful tool to probe cosmology as well as\ngalaxy evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2007 19:40:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2007 19:27:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

We simulate\nthe diffusion of cosmic rays from buoyant bubbles inflated by AGN. Our\nsimulations include the effects of the anisotropic particle diffusion\nintroduced by magnetic fields. Our models are consistent with the X-ray\nmorphology of AGN bubbles, with disruption being suppressed by the magnetic\ndraping effect.

For isotropic diffusion at a comparable level, cosmic rays would leak\nout of the bubbles too rapidly to be consistent with radio observations.

In the high-Tc cuprates, the presence of a Van Hove\nsingularity (VHS) in the density of states near the Fermi level was long ago\nproposed to enhance the many-body couplings and therefore may play a role in\nsuperconductivity.

The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance.

It actually yields Nash equilibria that define a proper\nsubclass of Nash equilibria. In 1965, Selten named this proper subclass subgame\nperfect equilibria. In game theory, payoffs are rewards usually granted at the\nend of a game. Although traditional game theory mainly focuses on real-valued\npayoffs that are implicitly ordered by the usual total order over the reals,\nworks of Simon or Blackwell already involved partially ordered payoffs. This\npaper generalises the notion of sequential game by replacing real-valued payoff\nfunctions with abstract atomic objects, called outcomes, and by replacing the\nusual total order over the reals with arbitrary binary relations over outcomes,\ncalled preferences. This introduces a general abstract formalism where Nash\nequilibrium, subgame perfect equilibrium, and ``backward induction'' can still\nbe defined. This paper proves that the following three propositions are\nequivalent: 1) Preferences over the outcomes are acyclic. 2) Every sequential\ngame has a Nash equilibrium. 3) Every sequential game has a subgame perfect\nequilibrium. The result is fully computer-certified using Coq.

CN emission is a tracer of dense molecular hydrogen gas (n(H2) > 10^4\ncm^{-3}) within star-forming molecular clouds, in particular in regions where\nthe clouds are affected by UV radiation. The HCN/CN intensity ratio can be used\nas a diagnostic for the relative importance of photodissociation regions (PDRs)\nin a source, and as a sensitive probe of optical depth, the radiation field,\nand photochemical processes.

Thus,\ntechniques aimed at identifying not only the information transmitted, but also\nthat number, play a central role in those systems. An example of application of\nthese techniques can be found in multiuser detection (MUD). In typical MUD\nanalyses, receivers are based on the assumption that the number of active users\nis constant and known at the receiver, and coincides with the maximum number of\nusers entitled to access the system. This assumption is often overly\npessimistic, since many users might be inactive at any given time, and\ndetection under the assumption of a number of users larger than the real one\nmay impair performance.\n  The main goal of this paper is to introduce a general approach to the problem\nof identifying active users and estimating their parameters and data in a\nrandom-access system where users are continuously entering and leaving the\nsystem. The tool whose use we advocate is Random-Set Theory: applying this, we\nderive optimum receivers in an environment where the set of transmitters\ncomprises an unknown number of elements. In addition, we can derive\nBayesian-filter equations which describe the evolution with time of the a\nposteriori probability density of the unknown user parameters, and use this\ndensity to derive optimum detectors.

From deep ACS imaging we construct a sample of 95 morphologically\nselected early-type galaxies in the HDF-N and CDF-S with spectroscopic\nredshifts in the range 0.85<z<1.15. We measure their 24 micron fluxes from the\ndeep GOODS-MIPS imaging and derive the IR luminosities and star formation\nrates.

In this work we suggest that the anomalies are due to the super position of\ntwo different events: 1) PRIMORDIAL SELF-ENRICHMENT: this is asked to explain\nthe oxygen depletion down to a minimum value [O/Fe]~ -0.4; 2) EXTRA MIXING IN A\nFRACTION OF THE STARS ALREADY BORN WITH ANOMALOUS COMPOSITION: these objects,\nstarting with already low [O/Fe], will reduce the oxygen abundance down to the\nmost extreme values. Contrary to other models that invoke extra mixing to\nexplain the chemical anomalies, we suggest that it is active only if there is a\nfraction of the stars in which the primordial composition is not only oxygen\ndepleted, but also extremely helium rich (Y~ 0.4), as found in a few GCs from\ntheir main sequence multiplicity. We propose that the rotational evolution (and\nan associated extra mixing) of extremely helium rich stars may be affected by\nthe fact that they develop a very small or non existent molecular weight\nbarrier during the evolution. We show that extra mixing in these stars, having\ninitial chemistry that has already been CNO processed, affects mainly the\noxygen abundance, and to a much smaller extent if affects the sodium abundance.\nThe model also predicts a large fluorine depletion concomitant with the oxygen\ndepletion, and a further enhancement of the surface helium abundance, which\nreaches values close to Y=0.5 in the computed models. We stress that, in this\ntentative explanation, those stars that are primordially O--depleted, but ARE\nNOT extremely helium rich do not suffer deep extra mixing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 May 2007 15:44:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

The association relies on forming patterns in the\nferrofluid during a trainingdphase, in which the magnetic dipoles are free to\nmove and rotate to minimize the total energy of the system. Once equilibrated\nin energy for a given input-output magnetic field pattern-pair the particles\nare fully or partially immobilized by cooling the carrier liquid. Thus produced\nparticle distributions control the memory states, which are read out\nmagnetically using spin-valve sensors incorporated in the output pads. The\nactual memory consists of spin distributions that is dynamic in nature,\nrealized only in response to the input patterns that the system has been\ntrained for. Two training algorithms for storing multiple patterns are\ninvestigated. Using Monte Carlo simulations of the physical system we\ndemonstrate that the device is capable of storing and recalling two sets of\nimages, each with an accuracy approaching 100%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 May 2007 12:40:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-27"}

The PC\nstudy of the electron-boson(phonon) interaction (EB(P)I) spectral function\nreveals pronounced phonon maxima at 16, 22 and 34meV. For the first time the\nhigh energy maxima at about 50meV and 100meV are resolved. Additionally, an\nadmixture of a crystalline-electric-field (CEF) excitations with a maximum near\n10meV and a `magnetic` peak near 3meV are observed. The contribution of the\n10-meV peak in PC EPI constant \\lambda_PC is evaluated as 20-30%, while\ncontribution of the high energy modes at 50 and 100meV amounts about 10% for\neach maxima, so the superconductivity might be affected by CEF excitations. The\nSC gap in HoNi2B2C exhibits a standard single-band BCS-like dependence, but\nvanishes at $T_c^*=5.6K<T_c, with 2\\Delta/kT_c^*=3.9. The strong coupling\nEliashberg analysis of the low-temperature SC phase with T_c^*=5.6K =T_N,\ncoexisting with the commensurate AF structure, suggests a sizable value of the\nEPI constant \\lambda_s=0.93. We also provide strong support for the recently\nproposed by us ''Fermi surface (FS) separation'' scenario for the coexistence\nof magnetism and superconductivity in magnetic borocarbides, namely, that the\nsuperconductivity in the commensurate AF phase survives at a special (nearly\nisotropic) FS sheet without an admixture of Ho 5d states.
