Such an approach\nleads to application of the stability theory for linear equation systems to\nestablish stability of the corresponding non-linear scheme. The main\nmethodological innovation is the theorems establishing the notion that a\nnon-linear scheme is stable (and monotone) if the corresponding scheme in\nvariations is stable (and, respectively, monotone). Criteria are developed for\nmonotonicity and stability of difference schemes associated with the numerical\nanalysis of systems of partial differential equations. The theorem of\nFriedrichs (1954) is generalized to be applicable to variational schemes with\nnon-symmetric matrices. A new modification of the central Lax-Friedrichs (LxF)\nscheme is developed to be of the second order accuracy. A monotone piecewise\ncubic interpolation is used in the central schemes to give an accurate\napproximation for the model in question. The stability and monotonicity of the\nmodified scheme are investigated. Some versions of the modified scheme are\ntested on several conservation laws, and the scheme is found to be accurate and\nrobust.

We\ndevelop a model-independent method where a small set of principal components\ncompletely encapsulate the effects of reionization on the large-angle E-mode\npolarization for any reionization history within an adjustable range in\nredshift. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, we apply this approach to\nboth the 3-year WMAP data and simulated future data. WMAP data constrain two\nprincipal components of the reionization history, approximately corresponding\nto the total optical depth and the difference between the contributions to the\noptical depth at high and low redshifts. The optical depth is consistent with\nthe constraint found in previous analyses of WMAP data that assume\ninstantaneous reionization, with only slightly larger uncertainty due to the\nexpanded set of models. Using the principal component approach, WMAP data also\nplace a 95% CL upper limit of 0.08 on the contribution to the optical depth\nfrom redshifts z>20. With improvements in polarization sensitivity and\nforeground modeling, approximately five of the principal components can\nultimately be measured.

Since very few such\nevents have ever been documented at infrared wavelengths, our aim is to study\nthe temporal evolution of OO Ser in the infrared. OO Ser was monitored with the\nInfrared Space Observatory starting 4 months after peak brightness and covering\n20 months. In 2004-2006 we again observed OO Ser from the ground and\ncomplemented this dataset with archival Spitzer obsevations also from 2004. We\nanalysed these data with special attention to source confusion and constructed\nlight curves at 10 different wavelengths as well as spectral energy\ndistributions. The outburst caused brightening in the whole infrared regime.\nAccording to the infrared light curves, OO Ser started a wavelength-independent\nfading after peak brightness. Later the flux decay became slower but stayed\nwavelength-independent. The fading is still ongoing, and current fading rates\nindicate that OO Ser will not return to quiescent state before 2011. The\noutburst timescale of OO Ser seems to be shorter than that of FUors, but longer\nthan that of EXors. The outburst timescale and the moderate luminosity suggest\nthat OO Ser is different from both FUors and EXors, and shows similarities to\nthe recently erupted young star V1647 Ori. Based on its spectral energy\ndistribution and bolometric temperature, OO Ser seems to be an early class I\nobject, with an age of < 10^5 yr. The object is probably surrounded by an\naccretion disc and a dense envelope. Due to the shorter outburst timescales,\nthe viscosity in the circumstellar disc of OO Ser is probably an order of\nmagnitude higher than usual for FUors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 May 2007 08:58:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Laser is an open\nsystem; its equilibrium is based on a balance of two thermodynamic forces, one\nrelated to the incoming pumping power and another to the emitted light. The\nbasic expression for such equilibrium is a logistic map, graphical solutions to\nwhich are pitchfork bifurcation diagrams. As pumping force increases, the\nrelative populations on the ground and lasing branches tend to zero and unity\ncorrespondingly. An interesting feature of this model is the line spectrum of\nthe up and down transitions between the branches beyond bifurcation point. Even\nin a simple case of 2-level laser with only 2 possible transition types (up and\ndown), the spectra look like sets of the line packets, starting well before the\npopulation inversion. This effect is an independent confirmation of the\nEinstein's prohibition on practical realization of 2-level laser. Multilevel\nlasers may be approached by employing the idea of thermodynamic activity for\nthe emitting atoms. Considering coefficient of thermodynamic activity of the\nlasing level atoms to be proportional to the ratio of life times on the upper\nand lasing (the 3d) levels, one can derive a new basic map for the multilevel\nlaser system. For a modest ratio only of 0.01, spontaneous transitions between\nlevels are pushed to the area beyond population inversion, opening a space for\nthe functioning of laser.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 May 2007 13:38:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Analyzed together with multiband polarization data from the\nliterature, probing the Chamaeleon I, Musca, rho Opiuchus, R CrA and Taurus\nclouds, we show that the wavelength of maximum polarization (lambda_max) is\nlinearly correlated with the radiation environment of the grains. Using\nFar-Infrared emission data, we show that the large scatter seen in previous\nstudies of lambda_max as a function of A_V is primarily due to line of sight\neffects causing some A_V measurements to not be a good tracer of the extinction\n(radiation field strength) seen by the grains being probed. The derived slopes\nin lambda_max vs. A_V, for the individual clouds, are consistent with a common\nvalue, while the zero intercepts scale with the average values of the ratios of\ntotal-to-selective extinction (R_V) for the individual clouds. Within each\ncloud we do not find direct correlations between lambda_max and R_V. The\npositive slope in consistent with recent developments in theory and indicating\nalignment driven by the radiation field. The present data cannot conclusively\ndifferentiate between direct radiative torques and alignment driven by H_2\nformation. However, the small values of lambda_max(A_V=0), seen in several\nclouds, suggest a role for the latter, at least at the cloud surfaces. The\nscatter in the lambda_max vs. A_V relation is found to be associated with the\ncharacteristics of the embedded Young Stellar Objects (YSO) in the clouds. We\npropose that this is partially due to locally increased plasma damping of the\ngrain rotation caused by X-rays from the YSOs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 May 2007 15:51:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

In order to quantify\nentanglement for any multipartite states we also need another concept the\nEntanglement Combination (EC) which can be used to completely describe the\nentanglement between any parties of the given quantum states.

Our\nmodel assumes an additional Yukawa-like term with two parameters that\ncharacterize the amplitude and the length scale of the modified gravity. The\nmodel predictions are calculated using two methods; the second-order\nperturbation theory and direct N-body simulations. These methods allow us to\nstudy non-linear evolution of large-scale structure. Using the simulation\nresults, we find that perturbation theory provides reliable estimates for the\npower spectrum and the bispectrum in the modified Newtonian model.

The\nresulting constraints from power spectrum are consistent with those obtained in\nour earlier work, indicating the validity of the previous empirical modeling of\ngravitational nonlinearity in the modified Newtonian model. If linear biasing\nis adopted, the bispectrum of the SDSS galaxies yields constraints very similar\nto those from the power spectrum. If we allow for the nonlinear biasing\ninstead, we find that the ratio of the quadratic to linear biasing\ncoefficients, b_2/b_1, should satisfy -0.4 < b_2/b_1<0.3 in the modified\nNewtonian model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 May 2007 15:42:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}
