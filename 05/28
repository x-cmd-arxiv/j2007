Helium atoms are preformed bosons\nand, in addition to their condensed superfluid state, can also form a quantum\nsolid, lacking phase-coherence. Here we show that the fate of Cooper pairs can\nbe more varied than the BCS or helium paradigms. In copper-oxide d-wave\nsuperconductors (dSC) Cooper pairs are intrinsically non-local objects, with\nboth center-of-mass and relative motions. As doping decreases, the center-of\nmass fluctuations force a correlated dSC into a state with enhanced\ndiamagnetism and robust but short-ranged superconducting order. At extreme\nunderdoping, the relative fluctuations take over and two pseudogaps --\n``small'' (charge) and ``large'' (spin) -- emerge naturally from the theory, as\nCooper pairs ``disintegrate'' and charge ``detaches'' from spin-singlet bonds.\nThe ensuing ground state(s) are governed by diagonal (mostly antiferromagnetic)\nrather than by superconducting (off-diagonal) correlations.

One\nsolution is to use the wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technique. Here,\nseveral different wavelengths can carry information over one POF fiber. All\nwavelengths that are transmitted over the fiber, must be separated at the\nreceiver to regain and redirect the information channels.

Previous determinations of the far infrared CIB (e.g., Hauser et\nal. 1998) were based on the detection of residual isotropic emission in skymaps\nfrom which the emission from interplanetary dust and the neutral interstellar\nmedium were removed. In this paper we use the Wisconsin H-alpha Mapper (WHAM)\nNorthern Sky Survey as a tracer of the ionized medium to examine the effect of\nthis foreground component on determination of the CIB. We decompose the DIRBE\nfar infrared data for five high Galactic latitude regions into H I and H-alpha\ncorrelated components and a residual component.

In 2006 April, the source peaked at a luminosity ~ 3 x\n10^{40} erg/s in the 0.3-10 keV band (similar to the maximum luminosity found\nby ASCA in 1995), and declined on an e-folding timescale ~ 3 days. The X-ray\nspectrum is always dominated by a broad power-law-like component. When the\nsource is seen at X-ray luminosities ~ 10^{40} erg/s, an additional soft\nthermal component (which we interpret as emission from the accretion disk)\ncontributes ~ 1/4 of the X-ray flux; when the luminosity is higher, ~ 3 x\n10^{40} erg/s, the thermal component is not detected and must contribute < 10%\nof the flux. At the beginning of the decline, ionized absorption is detected\naround 0.5-2 keV; it is a possible signature of a massive outflow. The\npower-law is always hard, with a photon index Gamma ~ 1.7 (and even flatter at\ntimes), as is generally the case with bright ULXs. We speculate that this\nsource and perhaps most other bright ULXs are in a high/hard state: as the\naccretion rate increases well above the Eddington limit, more and more power is\nextracted from the inner region of the inflow through non-radiative channels,\nand is used to power a Comptonizing corona, jet or wind. The observed thermal\ncomponent comes from the standard outer disk; the transition radius between\nouter standard disk and Comptonizing inner region moves further out and to\nlower disk temperatures as the accretion rate increases. This produces the\nobserved appearance of a large, cool disk. Based on X-ray luminosity and\nspectral arguments, we suggest that this accreting black hole has a likely mass\n~ 50-150 Msun (even without accounting for possible beaming).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 May 2007 20:17:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

It is assumed that mutation-selection\nbalance is reached in the presence of a fixed background concentration of\nantibiotic, to which the population must become resistant in order to survive.\nWe analyze the behavior of the model in the limit of low and high\nantibiotic-induced first-order death rate constants, and find that the highest\nmean fitness is obtained at low rates of bacterial conjugation. As the rate of\nconjugation crosses a threshold, the mean fitness decreases to a minimum, and\nthen rises asymptotically to a limiting value as the rate of conjugation\nbecomes infinitely large. However, this limiting value is smaller than the mean\nfitness obtained in the limit of low conjugation rate. This dependence of the\nmean fitness on the conjugation rate is fairly small for the parameter ranges\nwe have considered, and disappears as the first-order death rate constant due\nto the presence of antibiotic approaches zero. For large values of the\nantibiotic death rate constant, we have obtained an analytical solution for the\nbehavior of the mean fitness that agrees well with the results of simulations.\nThe results of this paper suggest that conjugation-mediated HGT has a slightly\ndeleterious effect on the mean fitness of a population at mutation-selection\nbalance. Therefore, we argue that HGT confers a selective advantage by allowing\nfor faster adaptation to a new or changing environment. The results of this\npaper are consistent with the observation that HGT can be promoted by\nenvironmental stresses on a population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 May 2007 22:13:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Jul 2009 20:02:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-06"}

For the no accretion case, we\nconsider the Einstein-Straus solution, where a black hole of constant mass\nresides in the dust Friedmann universe. We find negative cosmological\ncorrection besides the expected redshift factor. This is given in terms of the\ncubic root of ratio in size of the black hole to the cosmological horizon, so\nthat it is currently of order $10^{-5} (M/10^{6}M_{\\odot})^{1/3} (t/14\n{Gyr})^{-1/3}$ but could have been significant at the formation epoch of\nprimordial black holes. Due to the cosmological effects, this black hole has\nnot settled down to an equilibrium state.

For the significant accretion case, we consider the Sultana-Dyer\nsolution, where a black hole tends to increase its mass in proportion to the\ncosmological scale factor. In this model, we find that the radiation power is\napparently the same as the Hawking radiation from the Schwarzschild black hole\nof which mass is that of the growing mass at each moment. Hence, the energy\nloss rate decreases and tends to vanish as time proceeds. Consequently, the\nenergy loss due to evaporation is insignificant compared to huge mass accretion\nonto the black hole.

We\ndetermine the primary model parameters driving the IC to synchrotron emission\nratio in the case of a short duration central engine. We then investigate the\ncase of ES by a long duration central engine, or delayed external shock (DES),\na model that can account for some of the flares observed in GRB X-ray light\ncurves. We present model predictions, in particular in terms of GeV vs X-ray\nbehavior, and compare them with other models proposed to explain the origin of\nflares. We find that if most of the emission occurs when the fireball is in the\nfast cooling regime, then a substantial GeV emission is expected both for a\nshort (standard ES) and a long (DES) duration central engine activity. In\nparticular, in the context of standard ES we are able to account for the\ndelayed emission observed in GRB940217. In the case of DES, we find that IC\nscattering of X-ray flare photons can produce high energy flares in the GeV\nband, which can be detected by GLAST. The detectability of high energy flares\nimproves with the burst kinetic energy: about 30% of Swift GRBs showing flares\nin their X-ray light curve have sufficiently large kinetic energy so that the\nexpected high flares can be detected by GLAST. One important prediction of the\nDES model is the simultaneity between low and high energy flares. To test this\nsimultaneity, the peak energies of both flares need to fall below or within the\nobservational bands. We predict that X-ray flares with peak energy of ~10 eV\nproduce high energy flares with peak energy of around 100 MeV-GeV. Observations\nby Swift and GLAST then, can test the predicted simultaneity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 May 2007 15:59:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2007 17:17:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2007 09:36:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}
