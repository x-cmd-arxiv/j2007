Accumulation of mutations in organisms containing Gamma genes\ncan then be represented as diffusion within the Gamma dimensional hypercube\nwith adsorbing boundaries which are determined, in each dimension, by loss of a\nprotein stability and, at higher stability, by lack of protein sequences.\nSolving the diffusion equation whose parameters are derived from the data on\npoint mutations in proteins, we determine a universal distribution of protein\nstabilities, in agreement with existing data. The theory provides a fundamental\nrelation between mutation rate, maximal genome size and thermodynamic response\nof proteins to point mutations.

We also evaluate the predictions from these two models\nfor the Chlorine experiment event rate in the standard LMA and LMA+Spin Flavour\nPrecession (SFP) scenarios. It is found that after three years of SNO+ data\ntaking, the pep flux measurement will be able to discriminate between the\nstandard LMA and LMA+SFP scenarios, independently of which is the correct solar\nmodel. If the LMA rate is measured, SFP with $B_0 \\sim 280kG$ for the resonant\n$\\Delta m^2_{01}$ can be excluded at more than $4\\sigma$. A low rate would\nsignal new physics, excluding all the 90% allowed range of the standard LMA\nsolution at 3$\\sigma$, and a time variability would be a strong signature of\nthe SFP model. The CNO fluxes are the ones for which the two SSM predictions\nexhibit the largest differences, so their measurement at SNO+ will be important\nto favour one or the other. The distinction will be clearer after LMA or SFP\nare confirmed with pep, but still, a CNO measurement at the level of SSM I/LMA\nwill disfavour SSM II at about $3 \\sigma$. We conclude that consistency between\nfuture pep and CNO flux measurements at SNO+ and Chlorine would either favour\nan LMA+SFP scenario or favour SSM II over SSM I.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 May 2007 17:49:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2007 18:14:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Within this region the kinetic energy varies as a hyperbolic\ntangent. The following temporal evolution produces a shearless mixing. The\nanisotropy and intermittency of velocity and velocity derivative statistics is\nobserved. In particular the asymptotic behavior in time and as a function of\nthe energy ratio $E_1/E_2 \\to \\infty$ is discussed. This limit corresponds to\nthe maximum observable turbulent energy gradient for a given $E_1$ and is\nobtained through the limit $E_2 \\to 0$.

Lett. 88,\n112101 (2006)], and conclude that a dangling-bond area density of the order of\n10^{14}cm^{-2} is consistent with the data. This enables the prediction of\nsingle spin qubit coherence times as a function of the distance from the\ninterface and the dangling-bond area density in a real device structure. We\napply our theory to calculations of magnetic flux noise affecting SQUID devices\ndue to their Si/SiO_2 substrate. Our explicit estimates of flux noise in SQUIDs\nlead to a noise spectral density of the order of 10^{-12}Phi_{0}^{2} {Hz}^{-1}\nat f=1Hz. This value might explain the origin of flux noise in some SQUID\ndevices. Finally, we consider the suppression of these effects using surface\npassivation with hydrogen, and the residual nuclear-spin noise resulting from a\nperfect silicon-hydride surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 May 2007 18:50:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2007 02:02:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 19 Jan 2008 06:16:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-19"}

This approach consists of fitting the density\nof the model with a set of dynamical components, each of which have the same\nanisotropy profile. Using this approach we avoid the delicate fine-tuning\ndifficulties other fitting techniques typically encounter when constructing\nradially anisotropic models. We present a model anisotropy profile that\ngeneralizes the Osipkov-Merritt profile, and that can represent any smooth\nmonotonic anisotropy profile. Based on this model anisotropy profile, we\nconstruct a very general seven-parameter set of dynamical components for which\nthe most important dynamical properties can be calculated analytically. We use\nthe results to look for simple one-component dynamical models that generate\nsimple potential-density pairs while still supporting a flexible anisotropy\nprofile. We present families of Plummer and Hernquist models in which the\nanisotropy at small and large radii can be chosen as free parameters. We also\ngeneralize these two families to a three-parameter family that\nself-consistently generates the set of Veltmann potential-density pairs.\n(Abridged...)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 May 2007 20:48:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

For those interested in the empirical study of\nscrip systems, we demonstrate how characteristics of agents in a system can be\ninferred from the equilibrium distribution of money. From the perspective of a\nsystem designer, we examine the effect of the money supply on social welfare\nand show that social welfare is maximized by increasing the money supply up to\nthe point that the system experiences a ``monetary crash,'' where money is\nsufficiently devalued that no agent is willing to perform a service. We also\nexamine the implications of the presence of altruists and hoarders on the\nperformance of the system. While a small number of altruists may improve social\nwelfare, too many can also cause the system to experience a monetary crash,\nwhich may be bad for social welfare. Hoarders generally decrease social welfare\nbut, surprisingly, they also promote system stability by helping prevent\nmonetary crashes. In addition, we provide new technical tools for analyzing and\ncomputing equilibria by showing that our model exhibits strategic\ncomplementarities, which implies that there exist equilibria in pure strategies\nthat can be computed efficiently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 May 2007 21:14:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-30"}

Indeed, the role played by the latent \"heat\" or energy\nreleased in the phase transition is highly nontrivial and may lead to some\nsurprising, important results. In this paper, we take the wisdom that the\ncosmological QCD phase transition, which happened at a time between 10^(-5) sec\nand 10^(-4) sec or at the temperature of about 150 MeV and accounts for\nconfinement of quarks and gluons to within hadrons, would be of first order. To\nget the essence out of the scenario, it is sufficient to approximate the true\nQCD vacuum as one of degenerate theta-vacua and when necessary we try to model\nit effectively via a complex scalar field with spontaneous symmetry breaking.\nWe examine how and when \"pasted\" or \"patched\" domain walls are formed, how long\nsuch walls evolve in the long run, and we believe that the significant portion\nof dark matter could be accounted for in terms of such domain-wall structure\nand its remnants. Of course, the cosmological QCD phase transition happened in\nthe way such that the false vacua associated with baryons and many other\ncolor-singlet objects did not disappear (that is, using the bag-model language,\nthere are bags of radius 1.0 fermi for the baryons) - but the amount of the\nenergy remained in the false vacua is negligible. The latent energy released\ndue to the conversion of the false vacua to the true vacua, in the form of\n\"pasted\" or \"patched\" domain walls in the short run and their numerous evolved\nobjects, should make the concept of the \"radiation-dominated\" epoch, or of the\n\"matter-dominated\" epoch to be re-examined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 May 2007 07:03:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We resolve the disk from 8-60 AU\nin the near-IR JHK' bands at high resolution with the Keck II telescope and\nadaptive optics, and develop a novel data reduction technique for the removal\nof the stellar point spread function. The point source detection sensitivity in\nthe disk midplane is more than a magnitude less sensitive than regions away\nfrom the disk for some radii. We measure a blue color across the near-IR bands,\nand confirm the presence of substructure in the inner disk. Some of the\nstructural features exhibit wavelength-dependent positions. The disk\narchitecture and characteristics of grain composition are inferred through\nmodeling. We approach the modeling of the dust distribution in a manner that\ncomplements previous work. Using a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, we\ncompare a relatively simple model of the distribution of porous grains to a\nbroad data set, simultaneously fitting to midplane surface brightness profiles\nand the spectral energy distribution. Our model confirms that the large-scale\narchitecture of the disk is consistent with detailed models of steady-state\ngrain dynamics. Here, a belt of parent bodies from 35-40 AU is responsible for\nproducing dust that is then swept outward by the stellar wind and radiation\npressures. We infer the presence of very small grains in the outer region, down\nto sizes of ~0.05 micron. These sizes are consistent with stellar mass-loss\nrates Mdot_* << 10^2 Mdot_sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 May 2007 11:27:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The\nlocation of the metal-insulator transition as a function of the Coulomb\nrepulsion is shown to depend strongly on the sign of the hopping. Quite\ngenerally, the metal-insulator transition is characterized by lattice symmetry\nbreaking but the nature of the insulating Mott state is more complex than a\nsimple Charge Density Wave. Indeed, in the limit of large Coulomb repulsion,\nthe physics can be described in the framework of (extended) quantum\nfully-packed loop or dimer models carrying extra spin degrees of freedom.\nVarious diagonal and off-diagonal plaquette correlation functions are computed\nand the low-energy spectra are analyzed in details in order to characterize the\nnature of the insulating phases. We provide evidence that, as for an electronic\ndensity of n=1/2 (quarter-filling), the system at $n=1/4$ or $n=3/4$ exhibits\nalso plaquette order by forming a (lattice rotationally-invariant)\nResonating-Singlet-Pair Crystal, although with a quadrupling of the lattice\nunit cell (instead of a doubling for $n=1/2$) and a 4-fold degenerate ground\nstate.

The propagated\nfield is given in terms of an integral of a Fourier type, which cannot be\nevaluated even for simple models of the dispersive dielectric. The fact that\nthe oscillators have a low number density (dilute medium) and have a\nnarrow-band resonance allows us to simplify the integrand. In this case, the\nintegral can be evaluated exactly, although it is not possible using this\nmethod to separate out the transient part of the propagated field known as\noptical precursors. We also use an asymptotic method (saddle-point method) to\nevaluate the integral. The contributions to the integral related to the\nsaddle-points of the integrand give rise to the optical precursors. We obtain\nanalytic expressions for the precursor fields and the domain over which the\nasymptotic method is valid. When combined to obtain the total transient field,\nwe find that the agreement between the solutions obtained by the asymptotic and\nthe exact methods is excellent. Our results demonstrate that precursors can\npersist for many nanoseconds and the chirp in the instantaneous frequency of\nthe precursors can manifest itself in beats in the transmitted intensity. Our\nwork strongly suggests that precursors have been observed in many previous\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 May 2007 15:37:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Jun 2008 17:42:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2009 21:29:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-04"}

Its basic assumption is that\nthe initial curvature perturbation due to the inflaton field is negligible.\nThis is attained by lowering the energy scale of inflation, thereby highly\nsuppressing the amount of gravitational waves produced during inflation. We\ncompute the power-spectrum of the gravitational waves generated at second order\nin perturbation theory by the curvaton (isocurvature) perturbations between the\nend of inflation and the curvaton decay. An interesting property of this\ncontribution to the tensor perturbations is that it is directly proportional to\nthe amount of non-Gaussianity predicted within the curvaton scenario.

This\nexpression, due to Helmholtz, is not discussed here : it corresponds to the\nmost common model of a lip-type valve, when the valve is assumed to be a one\ndegree of freedom oscillator. The presented work is an extension of the works\ndone by Wilson and Beavers (1974), Tarnopolsky (2000). The range of the playing\nfrequencies is investigated. The first results are analytical : when no losses\nare present in the resonator, it is proven that the ratio between the threshold\nfrequency and the reed resonance frequency is found to be necessarily within\nthe interval between unity and the square root of 3. This is a musical sixth.\nActually the interval is largely smaller, and this is in accordance with e.g.\nthe results by Cullen et al.. The smallest blowing pressure is found to be\ndirectly related to the quality factor of the reed. Numerical results confirm\nthese statements, and are discussed in comparison with previous ones by Cullen\net al (2000).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 May 2007 15:50:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-30"}
