This is achieved by performing a scaling\nanalysis of this quantum geometric tensor in the vicinity of the critical\npoints. In this way most of the previous results are understood on general\ngrounds and new ones are found. We show that criticality is not a sufficient\ncondition to ensure superextensive divergence of the geometric tensor, and\nstate the conditions under which this is possible. The validity of this\nanalysis is further checked by exact diagonalization of the spin-1/2 XXZ\nHeisenberg chain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2007 18:40:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 May 2007 23:22:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-12-10"}

We prove\nthat the ratio of the optimal number of on-beams and the number of antennas\nconverges to a constant for a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when the number\nof transmit and receive antennas approaches infinity simultaneously and when\nbeamforming is perfect. Based on this result, a near optimal strategy, i.e.,\npower on/off strategy with a constant number of on-beams, is discussed. For\nsuch a strategy, we propose the power efficiency factor to quantify the effect\nof imperfect beamforming. A formula is proposed to compute the maximum power\nefficiency factor achievable given a feedback rate. The information rate of the\noverall MIMO system can be approximated by combining the asymptotic results and\nthe formula for power efficiency factor. Simulations show that this\napproximation is accurate for all SNR regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 May 2007 02:32:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-13"}

Towards this observation, we use asymptotic analysis to\nguide the design of feedback and transmission strategies. As L, m and the\nfeedback rates approach infinity linearly, we derive the asymptotic optimal\nfeedback strategy and a realistic criterion to decide which users should be\nturned on. Define the corresponding asymptotic throughput per antenna as the\nspatial efficiency. It is a function of the number of on-users s, and\ntherefore, s should be appropriately chosen. Based on the above asymptotic\nresults, we also develop a scheme for a system with finite many antennas and\nusers. Compared with other works where s is presumed constant, our scheme\nachieves a significant gain by choosing the appropriate s. Furthermore, our\nanalysis and scheme is valid for heterogeneous systems where different users\nmay have different path loss coefficients and feedback rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 May 2007 02:48:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-13"}

It is different from most works in\nliterature where p\\equiv q. The analysis for unequal dimensional quantization\nis based on the volume of a metric ball in G_{n,p}(L) whose center is in\nG_{n,q}(L). Our chief result is a closed-form formula for the volume of a\nmetric ball when the radius is sufficiently small. This volume formula holds\nfor Grassmann manifolds with arbitrary n, p, q and L, while previous results\npertained only to some special cases. Based on this volume formula, several\nbounds are derived for the rate distortion tradeoff assuming the quantization\nrate is sufficiently high. The lower and upper bounds on the distortion rate\nfunction are asymptotically identical, and so precisely quantify the asymptotic\nrate distortion tradeoff. We also show that random codes are asymptotically\noptimal in the sense that they achieve the minimum achievable distortion with\nprobability one as n and the code rate approach infinity linearly. Finally, we\ndiscuss some applications of the derived results to communication theory.

We\ndiscuss a ``natural'' refinement equation whose solution (a refinable function)\nis the characteristic function of the unit disc. This equation reflects the\nfact that the characteristic function of the unit disc is a sum of $p$\ncharacteristic functions of mutually disjoint discs of radius $p^{-1}$. This\nrefinement equation generates a MRA. The case $p=2$ is studied in detail. Our\nMRA is a 2-adic analog of the real Haar MRA. But in contrast to the real\nsetting, the refinable function generating our Haar MRA is 1-periodic, which\nnever holds for real refinable functions. This fact implies that there exist\ninfinity many different 2-adic orthonormal wavelet bases in ${\\cL}^2(\\bQ_2)$\ngenerated by the same Haar MRA. All of these bases are described.

We present here an on-going project aiming at a\nbetter description of the mass loss, that could be used to improve stellar\nevolution models -- especially the evolution during the TP-AGB phase. As a\nfirst step, we have considered the mass loss evolution during a He-shell flash.\nUsing stellar parameters sampled from a stellar evolutionary track, we have\ncomputed the time evolution of the atmospheric layers and wind acceleration\nregion during a flash event with detailed frequency-dependent\nradiation-hydrodynamical models including dust formation. Based on these\nresults, we have also simulated the subsequent long-term dynamical evolution of\nthe circumstellar envelope (CSE), including the formation of a detached shell.\nWe find that existing simple mass loss prescriptions imply different mass loss\nevolutions compared with our model. The second step of the project deals with\nthe dependence of mass loss on the basic stellar parameters. At the moment we\nare computing a large grid of wind models for C-rich AGB stars. Preliminary\nresults show that simple parameterisations are difficult to obtain in certain\nregions of the parameter space considered, due to strong non-linearities in the\nwind mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 May 2007 09:43:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2007 14:55:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-19"}

The argument is developed\nthrough the study of the extremals of action functionals defined on piecewise\ndifferentiable curves, in the presence of differentiable non-holonomic\nconstraints. Special emphasis is put on the tensorial aspects of the theory. To\nstart with, the kinematical foundations, culminating in the so called\nvariational equation, are put on geometrical grounds, via the introduction of\nthe concept of infinitesimal control . On the same basis, the usual\nclassification of the extremals of a variational problem into normal and\nabnormal ones is also rationalized, showing the existence of a purely\nkinematical algorithm assigning to each admissible curve a corresponding\nabnormality index, defined in terms of a suitable linear map. The whole\nmachinery is then applied to constrained variational calculus. The argument\nprovides an interesting revisitation of Pontryagin maximum principle and of the\nErdmann-Weierstrass corner conditions, as well as a proof of the classical\nLagrange multipliers method and a local interpretation of Pontryagin's\nequations as dynamical equations for a free (singular) Hamiltonian system.

The detector, named as ENSTAR detector, consists of 122\npieces of plastic scintillator of various shapes and sizes, which are arranged\nin a cylindrical geometry to provide particle identification, energy loss and\ncoarse position information for these particles. A solid angle coverage of\n$\\sim$95% of total 4$\\pi$ is obtained in the present design of the detector.\nMonte Carlo phase space calculations performed to simulate the formation and\ndecay of $\\eta$-mesic nuclei suggest that its decay particles, the protons and\npions are emitted with an opening angle of 150$^\\circ \\pm 20^\\circ$, and with\nenergies in the range of 25 to 300 MeV and 225 to 450 MeV respectively. The\ndetailed GEANT simulations show that $\\sim$ 80 % of the decay particles\n(protons and pions) can be detected within ENSTAR. Several test measurements\nusing alpha source, cosmic-ray muons etc. have been carried out to study the\nresponse of ENSTAR scintillator pieces. The in-beam tests of fully assembled\ndetector with proton beam of momentum 870 MeV/c from the Cooler synchrotron\nCOSY have been performed. The test results show that the scintillator fiber\ndesign chosen for the detector has performed satisfactorily well. The present\narticle describes the detector design, simulation studies, construction details\nand test results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 May 2007 15:55:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
