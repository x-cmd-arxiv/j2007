In our trilayers the magnetoresistance exhibits an increase of two\norders of magnitude when the superconducting state is reached: from the\nconventional normal-state values 0.6 % it goes up to 1000 % for temperatures\nbelow Tc. In contrast, in the bilayers the effect is only minor since from 3%\nin the normal state increases only to 70 % for temperatures below Tc.\nMagnetization data of both the longitudinal and transverse magnetic components\nare presented. Most importantly, we present data not only for the normal state\nof Nb but also in its superconducting state. Strikingly, these data show that\nbelow its Tc SC the Nb interlayer under the influence of the outer Ni80Fe20\nlayers attains a magnetization component transverse to the external field. By\ncomparing the transport and magnetization data we propose a candidate mechanism\nthat could motivate the pronounced magnetoresistance effect observed in the\ntrilayers.

Referring to\nthe bilayers, although out-of-plane rotation of the magnetization of the single\nNi80Fe20 layer is still observed, in these structures magnetostatic coupling\ndoes not occur due to the absence of a second Ni80Fe20 one so that the observed\nmagnetoresistance peaks are only modest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 May 2007 17:22:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The field is produced\nby a permanent magnet enclosed in an inner sphere, which can rotate at a\nseparate rate, producing a spherical Couette flow. The flow properties are\ninvestigated by measuring electric potentials on the outer sphere, the induced\nmagnetic field in the laboratory frame, and velocity profiles inside the liquid\nsodium using ultrasonic Doppler velocimetry. The present article focuses on the\ntime-averaged axisymmetric part of the flow. The Doppler profiles show that the\nangular velocity of the fluid is relatively uniform in most of the fluid shell,\nbut rises near the inner sphere, revealing the presence of a magnetic wind, and\ngently drops towards the outer sphere. The transition from a magnetostrophic\nflow near the inner sphere to a geostrophic flow near the outer sphere is\ncontrolled by the local Elsasser number. For Rossby numbers up to order 1, the\nobserved velocity profiles all show a similar shape. Numerical simulations in\nthe linear regime are computed, and synthetic velocity profiles are compared\nwith the measured ones. In the geostrophic region, a torque-balance model\nprovides very good predictions. We find that the induced magnetic field varies\nin a consistent fashion, and displays a peculiar peak in the counter-rotating\nregime. This happens when the fluid rotation rate is almost equal and opposite\nto the outer sphere rotation rate. The fluid is then almost at rest in the\nlaboratory frame, and the Proudman-Taylor constraint vanishes, enabling a\nstrong meridional flow. We suggest that dynamo action might be favored in such\na situation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 May 2007 08:37:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Aug 2008 09:59:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-14"}

Radio continuum observations of the galaxy were carried out at 320\nMHz, 610 MHz and 1.4 GHz. Continuum emission was detected and mapped in the\ngalaxy. The emission appears extended over the inner disk at all three\nfrequencies. At 1.4 GHz and 610 MHz it appears to have two distinct lobes.

Nowadays, one of the key challenges is\nto integrate data mining methods within the framework of traditional database\nsystems.

Thus this is an ideal\nmethod to solve the initial data/constraint equations in General Relativity for\n(for instance) black hole interactions, or for other strong-field gravitational\nconfigurations. Recent efforts have produced finite difference multigrid\nsolvers for domains with holes (excised regions). We present here the extension\nof these concepts to higher order (fourth-, sixth- and eigth-order). The high\norder convergence allows rapid solution on relatively small computational\ngrids. Also, general relativity evolution codes are moving to typically\nfourth-order; data have to be computed at least as accurately as this same\norder for straightfoward demonstration of the proper order of convergence in\nthe evolution.\n  Our vertex-centered multigrid code demonstrates globally high-order-accurate\nsolutions of elliptic equations over domains containing holes, in two spatial\ndimensions with fixed (Dirichlet) outer boundary conditions, and in three\nspatial dimensions with {\\it Robin} outer boundary conditions. We demonstrate a\n``real world'' 3-dimensional problem which is the solution of the conformally\nflat Hamiltonian constraint of General Relativity. The success of this method\ndepends on: a) the choice of the discretization near the holes; b) the\ndefinition of the location of the inner boundary, which allows resolution of\nthe hole even on the coarsest grids; and on maintaining the same order of\nconvergence at the boundaries as in the interior of the computational domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 May 2007 14:30:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Such asymmetry is often seen in superwind\ngalaxies known to date, and also consistent with a theoretical prediction of\nsuperwind activity. There are eight objects (8/18 ~ 40%) that have large EWs\nexceeding 200 A, and no clear signature of superwind activities. Such large EWs\ncannot be explained in terms of photo-ionization by a moderately old (>10^7\nyrs) stellar population, even with a top-heavy IMF or an extremely low\nmetallicity. These eight objects clearly show a positive correlation between\nthe Ly-alpha luminosity and the velocity width. This suggests that these eight\nobjects are good candidates for forming-galaxies in a gas-cooling phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 May 2007 15:07:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Although Blazars are a small fraction of the overall AGN population\nthey are expected to be the dominant population of extragalactic sources in the\nhard X-ray and gamma-ray bands and have been shown to be the largest\ncontaminant of CMB fluctuation maps. So far the number of known blazars is of\nthe order of several hundreds, but the forthcoming AGILE, GLAST and Planck\nspace observatories will detect several thousand of objects of this type. Aims.\nIn preparation for these missions it is necessary to identify new samples of\nblazars to study their multi-frequency characteristics and statistical\nproperties. Methods. We compiled a sample of objects with blazar-like\nproperties via a cross-correlation between large radio (NVSS, ATCAPMN) and X-\nray surveys (RASS) using the SDSS-DR4 and 2dF survey data to spectroscopically\nidentify our candidates and test the validity of the selection method. Results.\nWe present the Radio - Optical - X-ray catalog built at ASDC (ROXA), a list of\n816 objects among which 510 are confirmed blazars. Only 19% of the candidates\nturned out to be certainly non-blazars demonstrating the high efficiency of our\nselection method. Conclusions. Our catalog includes 173 new blazar\nidentifications, or about 10% of all presently known blazars. The relatively\nhigh flux threshold in the X-ray energy band (given by the RASS survey)\npreferentially selects objects with high fx / fr ratio leading to the discovery\nof new High Energy Peaked BL Lac (HBLs). Our catalog therefore includes many\nnew potential targets for GeV-TeV observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 May 2007 15:32:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Such constraints are found to be\ncompetitive with those obtained from the dijet data. The current $t \\bar t$\ndata from the Tevatron rule out axigluon masses ($m_A$) up to 900 GeV and 850\nGeV at 2 $\\sigma$ and 4 $\\sigma$ levels respectively. For the case of flavour\nuniversal colorons the data rule out a mass ($m_C$) below 800 GeV (780 GeV) at\nthe $2 (4) \\sigma $ level and also the mass range between 900 GeV to 2.1 TeV at\n2 $\\sigma$ level, for $\\cot \\xi = 1$, where $\\xi$ is the mixing angle.

We also compute the expected\nforward-backward asymmetry for the case of the axigluons which would allow it\nto be discriminated against the SM as also the colorons. We further find that\nat the LHC, the signal should be visible in the $t \\bar t$ invariant mass\nspectrum for a wide range of axigluon and coloron masses that are still\nallowed. We point out how top polarisation may be used to further discriminate\nthe axigluon and coloron case from the SM as well as from each other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 May 2007 15:34:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2007 14:45:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
