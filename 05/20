Building on these results,\nour results lead to the following implications of multipath sparsity: 1) The\ncoherence requirements are shared in both time and frequency, thereby\nsignificantly relaxing the required scaling in coherence time with SNR; 2)\nSparse multipath channels are asymptotically coherent -- for a given but large\nbandwidth, the channel can be learned perfectly and the coherence requirements\nfor first- and second-order optimality met through sufficiently large signaling\nduration; and 3) The requirement of peaky signals in attaining capacity is\neliminated or relaxed in sparse environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 May 2007 03:06:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The slow-wave coefficients for azimunthally symmetric\nguided waves increase with the number of metallic CNTs in the bundle, tending\nfor thick bundles to unity, which is characteristic of macroscopic metallic\nwires. The existence of an azimuthally nonsymmetric guided wave at low\nfrequencies in a bundle of a large number of finite-length CNTs stands in\ncontrast to the characteristics of guided-wave propagation in a single CNT. The\nequivalent-multishell approach yields the polarizability scalar and the antenna\nefficiency of a bundle of finite-length CNTs in the long-wavelength regime over\na wide frequency range spanning the terahertz and the near-infrared regimes.\nEdge effects give rise to geometric resonances in such bundles.\n  The antenna efficiency of a CNT bundle at the first resonance can exceed that\nof a single CNT by four orders of magnitude, which is promising for the design\nand development of CNT-bundle antennas and composite materials containing\nCNT-bundles as inclusions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 May 2007 13:39:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The generic coincidence problem that appears in the\noriginal Einstein universe model is shown to arise from a misunderstanding\nabout the magnitude of dark energy density and the epoch time governing the\nappearance of the integer relation between dark energy and normal energy\ndensity. The solution to the generic case then clearly points to the source of\nthe time coincidence integer problem in the Friedman dust universe model. It is\nthen possible to eliminate this coincidence by removing a degeneracy between\ndifferent measurement epoch times. In this paper's first appendix, a\nfundamental time dependent relation between dark mass and dark energy is\nderived with suggestions how this relation could explain cosmological voids and\nthe clumping of dark mass to become visible matter. In this paper's second\nappendix, it is shown that that dark energy is a conserved with time substance\nthat is everywhere and for all time permeable to the dark mass and visible mass\nof which the contracting or expanding universe is composed. The last two\nappendices involve detailed studies of cosmology, quantum dark energy related\nissues.
