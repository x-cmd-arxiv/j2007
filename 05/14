Our results can\nbe summarized as follows. (1) The variability of solar polar regions' area has\na correlation with total unsigned magnetic flux in advance of 5 years. (2) The\nhigh-latitude region mainly appears unipolar in the whole solar cycle and its\nflux peak time lags sunspot cycle for 3 years.

Measured\nvelocity dispersions are 130-340 km/s with a mean of 216 km/s. Converting to BH\nmass, we find that the BH mass distribution is identical for FRIs and FRIIs,\nwith a mean of approximately 2.5x10^8 Msun.

Most of the galaxies with\nFRI morphology and/or low-excitation emission-line spectra have progressively\nlower BH masses at lower photoionizing (and jet) luminosities. This agrees with\nthe Ledlow-Owen relation which states that the radio luminosity at the FRI/FRII\ntransition depends on the optical luminosity of the host, L_radio ~\nL_optical^1.8, because both L_radio and L_optical relate to AGN nuclear\nparameters.

The FRI/FRII transition occurs at approximately an order\nof magnitude lower luminosity relative to the Eddington luminosity than the\nsoft-to-hard transition in X-ray binaries. This difference is consistent with\nthe Ledlow-Owen relation, which predicts a weak BH mass dependence in the\ntransition luminosity.

This paper considers the role\nof CIV 1549 measures with special emphasis on the CIV 1549 line shift as a\nprincipal 4DE1 diagnostic. We use HST archival spectra for 130 sources with S/N\nhigh enough to permit reliable CIV 1549 broad component (BC) measures. We find\na CIV 1549 BC profile blueshift that is strongly concentrated among (largely\nradio-quiet: RQ) sources with FWHM(H beta BC) < 4000 km/s (which we call\nPopulation A). Narrow line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1, with FWHM H beta < 2000 km/s)\nsources belong to this population but do not emerge as a distinct class. The\nsystematic blueshift, widely interpreted as arising in a disk wind/outflow, is\nnot observed in broader lined AGN which we call Population B.

Main topic of our manuscript are critical phenomena\nin spin systems defined on the recurrence lattices. Main tool of our approach\nis the method of recursive (hierarchical) lattices. We apply the method of\ndynamical mapping (or recursive lattices) for investigation of magnetic\nproperties of the fluid and solid $^3$He, phase transitions in crystals and\nmacromolecules. First, we analyze the helix-coil phase transition for\npolypeptides and proteins, and describe an quasi unfolding transition (like the\ncold denaturation process) for the degree of helicity (the order parameter for\nmacromolecules). Next we consider the recurrent models of $^3$He defined on the\nsquare, Husimi and hexagon lattices. Using the method of dynamical mapping, the\nmagnetization curves with plateaus, bifurcation point and one period doubling\nare obtained. Then we investigate the model with cubic symmetry defined on the\nBethe lattice and containing both linear and quadratic spin-spin interactions.\nThe magnetization of the system is calculated, and a complex structure of the\nphase transitions between the disordered, partially ordered and completely\nordered states is observed. In the framework of QCD, we consider the azimuthal\nasymmetries in heavy flavor production in the lepton-nucleon deep inelastic\nscattering (DIS). We calculate the azimuthal (or $\\phi$-) dependence of the\nnext-to-leading order heavy-quark-initiated contributions to DIS. It is shown\nthat, contrary to the basic gluon-initiated component, the photon-quark\nscattering mechanism is practically $\\cos2\\phi$-independent.

Halfspace depth is a measure of data depth. Given a set S of points and a\npoint p, the halfspace depth (or rank) k of p is defined as the minimum number\nof points of S contained in any closed halfspace with p on its boundary.\nComputing halfspace depth is NP-hard, and it is equivalent to the Maximum\nFeasible Subsystem problem. In this thesis a mixed integer program is\nformulated with the big-M method for the halfspace depth problem. We suggest a\nbranch and cut algorithm. In this algorithm, Chinneck's heuristic algorithm is\nused to find an upper bound and a related technique based on sensitivity\nanalysis is used for branching. Irreducible Infeasible Subsystem (IIS) hitting\nset cuts are applied. We also suggest a binary search algorithm which may be\nmore stable numerically.

We show that there are two qualitatively\ndifferent dynamical regimes of the coupled breathers, either immovable or\nslowly-moving: the periodic transverse translation (wandering) of low-amplitude\nbreather between the chains, and the one-chain-localization of high-amplitude\nbreather. These two modes of coupled nonlinear excitations, which involve large\nnumber of anharmonic oscillators, can be mapped onto two solutions of a single\npendulum equation, detached by a separatrix mode. We also study two-chain\nbreathers, which can be considered as bound states of discrete breathers with\ndifferent symmetry and center locations in the coupled chains, and bifurcation\nof the anti-phase two-chain breather into the one-chain one. Delocalizing\ntransition of 1D breather in 2D system of a large number of parallel coupled\nnonlinear chains is described, in which the breather, initially excited in a\ngiven chain, abruptly spreads its vibration energy in the whole 2D system upon\ndecreasing breather frequency or amplitude below the threshold one. The\nthreshold breather frequency is above the cut off phonon frequency in 2D\nsystem, and the threshold breather amplitude scales as square root of the\ninter-chain coupling constant. Delocalizing transition of discrete vibrational\nbreather in 2D and 3D systems of coupled nonlinear chains has an analogy with\ndelocalizing transition for Bose-Einstein condensates in 2D and 3D optical\nlattices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 May 2007 15:12:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2008 05:28:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
