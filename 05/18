We perform a similar analyis of the T8 and T7.5 dwarfs\n2MASS J09393548-2448279 and 2MASS J11145133-2618235 using published data,\ncomparing them to the well-studied T8, 2MASS J04151954-0935066. We find that\nthe two dwarfs have the same Teff as the reference dwarf, and similar\ngravities, but lower metallicities. The parameters are Teff=725-775K and [m/H]=\n-0.3; log g=5.3-5.45 for 2MASS J09393548-2448279 and log g=5.0-5.3 for 2MASS\nJ11145133- 261823. The age and mass are ~10Gyr and 60M_Jup for 2MASS\nJ09393548-2448279, and ~5 Gyr and 40M_Jup for 2MASS J11145133-261823. A serious\nlimitation is the incompleteness of the line lists of CH4 and NH3 at lambda\n<1.7um. Spectra of Saturn and Jupiter, and of laboratory CH4 and NH3 gas,\nsuggest that NH3 features in the Y- and J-bands may be useful as indicators of\nthe next cooler spectral type, and not features in the H- and K-bands as\npreviously thought. However large uncertainties remain, as the abundance of NH3\nis likely to be significantly below the chemical equilibrium value, and\ninclusion of laboratory NH3 opacities predicts band shapes that are discrepant\nwith existing data. It is possible that the T spectral class will have to be\nextended to low temperatures around 400K, when water clouds condense in the\natmosphere [abridged].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 May 2007 20:47:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

The main motivation for\nconsidering a sample eigenvalue based scheme is the computational simplicity\nand the robustness to eigenvector modelling errors which are can adversely\nimpact the performance of estimators that exploit information in the sample\neigenvectors.\n  There is, however, a price we pay by discarding the information in the sample\neigenvectors; we highlight a fundamental asymptotic limit of sample eigenvalue\nbased detection of weak/closely spaced high-dimensional signals from a limited\nsample size. This motivates our heuristic definition of the effective number of\nidentifiable signals which is equal to the number of \"signal\" eigenvalues of\nthe population covariance matrix which exceed the noise variance by a factor\nstrictly greater than 1+sqrt(Dimensionality of the system/Sample size). The\nfundamental asymptotic limit brings into sharp focus why, when there are too\nfew samples available so that the effective number of signals is less than the\nactual number of signals, underestimation of the model order is unavoidable (in\nan asymptotic sense) when using any sample eigenvalue based detection scheme,\nincluding the one proposed herein. The analysis reveals why adding more sensors\ncan only exacerbate the situation. Numerical simulations are used to\ndemonstrate that the proposed estimator consistently estimates the true number\nof signals in the dimension fixed, large sample size limit and the effective\nnumber of identifiable signals in the large dimension, large sample size limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 May 2007 21:43:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

As a\ncorollary it is shown that $\\pi_i \\big(\\Hom_*(G,H) \\big) \\cong [G,\\Omega^i\nH]_{\\times}$, where $\\Omega H$ is the graph of based closed paths in $H$ and\n$[G,K]_{\\times}$ is the set of $\\times$-homotopy classes of pointed graph maps\nfrom $G$ to $K$. This is similar in spirit to the results of \\cite{BBLL}, where\nthe authors seek a space whose homotopy groups encode a similarly defined\nhomotopy theory for graphs. The categorical connections to those constructions\nare discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 May 2007 00:50:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 May 2008 10:35:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 Jul 2008 09:18:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-07"}

A flux density for HB 3 at 2695 MHz is derived from Effelsberg\nsurvey data. The spectrum of HB 3 is well represented by a simple power-law\nspectrum from 22 to 2695 MHz, with a spectral index of 0.56 +/- 0.03. It is\nconcluded that contamination with thermal emission from adjacent regions is the\ncause for the reported spectral flattening of HB 3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 May 2007 07:35:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-08-15"}

Recently, a powerful new\nalgorithm called Affinity Propagation (AP) based on message-passing techniques\nwas proposed by Frey and Dueck \\cite{Frey07}. In AP, each cluster is identified\nby a common exemplar all other data points of the same cluster refer to, and\nexemplars have to refer to themselves. Albeit its proved power, AP in its\npresent form suffers from a number of drawbacks. The hard constraint of having\nexactly one exemplar per cluster restricts AP to classes of regularly shaped\nclusters, and leads to suboptimal performance, {\\it e.g.}, in analyzing gene\nexpression data. Results: This limitation can be overcome by relaxing the AP\nhard constraints. A new parameter controls the importance of the constraints\ncompared to the aim of maximizing the overall similarity, and allows to\ninterpolate between the simple case where each data point selects its closest\nneighbor as an exemplar and the original AP. The resulting soft-constraint\naffinity propagation (SCAP) becomes more informative, accurate and leads to\nmore stable clustering. Even though a new {\\it a priori} free-parameter is\nintroduced, the overall dependence of the algorithm on external tuning is\nreduced, as robustness is increased and an optimal strategy for parameter\nselection emerges more naturally. SCAP is tested on biological benchmark data,\nincluding in particular microarray data related to various cancer types. We\nshow that the algorithm efficiently unveils the hierarchical cluster structure\npresent in the data sets. Further on, it allows to extract sparse gene\nexpression signatures for each cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 May 2007 08:22:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2007 16:40:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-11-29"}

A torus with the ratio between its two\ngenerated radii larger than $\\sqrt{2}$ is predicted from the Euler-Lagrange\nequations. It is found that tubules with helically modulated tilting state are\nnot admitted by the Euler-Lagrange equations, and that they are less\nenergetically favorable than helical ripples in tubules. The pitch angles of\nhelical ripples are theoretically estimated to be about 0$^\\circ$ and\n35$^\\circ$, which are close to the most frequent values 5$^\\circ$ and\n28$^\\circ$ observed in the experiment [N. Mahajan \\textit{et al.}, Langmuir\n\\textbf{22}, 1973 (2006)]. Additionally, the present theory can explain twisted\nribbons of achiral cationic amphiphiles interacting with chiral tartrate\ncounterions. The ratio between the width and pitch of twisted ribbons is\npredicted to be proportional to the relative concentration difference of left-\nand right-handed enantiomers in the low relative concentration difference\nregion, which is in good agreement with the experiment [R. Oda \\textit{et al.},\nNature (London) \\textbf{399}, 566 (1999)].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 May 2007 14:21:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2007 04:55:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-09-27"}

The line luminosities can be interpreted as coming from a blob or jet\ncontaining only ~ 0.1 - 0.4 Msun, in which ~ 0.02 - 0.06 Msun is 56Ni\nsynthesized at the explosion. To explain the blueshift, the blob should either\nbe of unipolar moving at the center-of-mass velocity v ~ 2,000 - 5,000 km s-1,\nor suffer from self-absorption within the ejecta as seen in SN 1990I.

The low\nluminosity at the late phase (the absolute R magnitude M_R ~ -10.2 mag at ~ 270\ndays) sets the upper limit for the mass of 56Ni < ~ 0.08 Msun, which is in\ncontradiction to the value necessary to explain the second, main peak\nluminosity (M_R ~ -18.3 mag at ~ 40 days).
