We show that in presence of an environment, the\noscillatory dynamics of a quantum two-level system, in analogy with a classical\ndamped oscillator, can undergo a quantum dynamical phase transition to a\nnon-oscillatory phase.

As an application, they showed that the maximal number\nof visits to a vertex, made by a non-backtracking random walk of length $n$ on\na high-girth $n$-vertex regular expander, is typically $(1+o(1))\\frac{\\log\nn}{\\log\\log n}$, as in the case of the balls and bins experiment.

Let $N_t$ denote\nthe number of vertices visited precisely $t$ times by a non-backtracking random\nwalk of length $n$ on a regular $n$-vertex expander of fixed degree and girth\n$g$.

The latter is a key\nproperty of the Moon's apparent orbit around the Earth - the nodes of that\norbit precess around the ecliptic, completing one revolution every 18.6 years.\nThis precession is responsible for a number of astronomical phenomena, e.g. the\nyear to year drift of solar and lunar eclipse periods. It also controls the\necliptic latitude at which the Moon crosses the magnetotail and thus the number\nand duration of lunar encounters with the plasmasheet. This paper presents a\ndetailed model of those encounters and applies it to the period 1960 to 2030.\nThis shows that the total lunar exposure to the plasmasheet will vary from 10\nhours per month at a minimum of the eighteen-year cycle rising to 40 hours per\nmonth at the maximum. These variations could have a profound impact on the\naccumulation of charge due plasmasheet electrons impacting the lunar surface.\nThus we should expect the level of lunar surface charging to vary over the\neighteen-year cycle. The literature contains reports that support this: several\nobservations made during the cycle maximum of 1994-2000 are attributed to\nbombardment and charging of the lunar surface by plasmasheet electrons. Thus we\nconclude that lunar surface charging will vary markedly over an eighteen-year\ncycle driven by lunar precession. It is important to interpret lunar\nenvironment measurements in the context of this cycle and to allow for the\ncycle when designing equipment for deployment on the lunar surface.

This process is\ndual to the zero-range process (ZRP) in the sense that, while for the ZRP the\nrate of transfer of a particle only depends on the occupation of the departure\nsite, it only depends on the occupation of the arrival site for the target\nprocess. More precisely, duality associates to a given ZRP a unique target\nprocess, and vice-versa. If the dynamics is symmetric, i.e., in the absence of\na bias, both processes have the same stationary-state product measure. In this\nwork we focus our interest on the situation where the latter measure exhibits a\ncontinuous condensation transition at some finite critical density $\\rho_c$,\nirrespective of the dimensionality. The novelty comes from the case of\nasymmetric dynamics, where the target process has a nontrivial fluctuating\nstationary state, whose characteristics depend on the dimensionality. In one\ndimension, the system remains homogeneous at any finite density. An alternating\nscenario however prevails in the high-density regime: typical configurations\nconsist of long alternating sequences of highly occupied and less occupied\nsites. The local density of the latter is equal to $\\rho_c$ and their\noccupation distribution is critical. In dimension two and above, the asymmetric\ntarget process exhibits a phase transition at a threshold density $\\rho_0$ much\nlarger than $\\rho_c$. The system is homogeneous at any density below $\\rho_0$,\nwhereas for higher densities it exhibits an extended condensate elongated along\nthe direction of the mean current, on top of a critical background with density\n$\\rho_c$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 May 2007 13:57:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-08-06"}
