When averaged, two independent analyses find the\ncharge ratio underground to be 1.374 +/- 0.004 (stat.) +0.012 -0.010(sys.).\nUsing the map of the Soudan rock overburden, the muon momenta as measured\nunderground were projected to the corresponding values at the surface in the\nenergy range 1-7 TeV. Within this range of energies at the surface, the MINOS\ndata are consistent with the charge ratio being energy independent at the two\nstandard deviation level. When the MINOS results are compared with measurements\nat lower energies, a clear rise in the charge ratio in the energy range 0.3 --\n1.0 TeV is apparent. A qualitative model shows that the rise is consistent with\nan increasing contribution of kaon decays to the muon charge ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 May 2007 17:44:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 May 2007 18:40:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 31 May 2007 15:21:26 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2007 22:14:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-27"}

This question involves a dynamical range of 10^13 in mass and we\naddress it by combining N-body simulations of structure formation to identify\nthe most massive halos at z~6 with a Monte Carlo method based on linear theory\nto obtain the location and formation times of the first light halos within the\nwhole simulation box.

The SN flash takes an extra 8 d\nto hit the MS, and this was confirmed at 2e39 ergs/s in the optical at day 8. A\nramp in luminosity starting near day 10 indicates particles from the BJ hitting\nthe PE, with the fastest particles traveling at 0.8 c, and an upper limit for\nthe optical luminosity of the MS of 5e40 ergs/s at day 20. The details of SN\n1987A strongly suggest that it resulted from a merger of 2 stellar cores of a\ncommon envelope (CE) binary, i.e. a \"double-degenerate\" (DD)-initiated SN, and\nis thus the Rosetta Stone for 99% of MSPs in the non-core-collapsed globular\nclusters, GRBs, and SNe, including all recent nearby SNe except SN 1986J and\nthe more distant SN 2006gy.

These discrete-time models are\nbased on a discrete variational principle, and are part of the broader field of\ngeometric integration. Geometric integrators are numerical integration methods\nthat preserve geometric properties of continuous systems, such as conservation\nof the symplectic form, momentum, and energy. They also guarantee that the\ndiscrete flow remains on the manifold on which the continuous system evolves,\nan important property in the case of rigid-body dynamics.\n  In nonlinear control, one typically relies on differential geometric and\ndynamical systems techniques to prove properties such as stability,\ncontrollability, and optimality. More generally, the geometric structure of\nsuch systems plays a critical role in the nonlinear analysis of the\ncorresponding control problems. Despite the critical role of geometry and\nmechanics in the analysis of nonlinear control systems, nonlinear control\nalgorithms have typically been implemented using numerical schemes that ignore\nthe underlying geometry.\n  The field of discrete control system aims to address this deficiency by\nrestricting the approximation to choice of a discrete-time model, and\ndeveloping an associated control theory that does not introduce any additional\napproximation. In particular, this involves the construction of a control\ntheory for discrete-time models based on geometric integrators that yields\nnumerical implementations of nonlinear and geometric control algorithms that\npreserve the crucial underlying geometric structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 May 2007 04:14:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-29"}

Both ways of magnetic energy\nrelease are thought to be important to CME dynamics. To disentangle their\ncontributions, we construct a flux rope catastrophe model in the corona and\nsolar wind and compare different cases in which we either prohibit or allow\nmagnetic reconnection to take place across rapidly-growing current sheets\nduring the eruption.

Nevertheless, the eruptive speed can be significantly enhanced\nafter magnetic reconnection sets in. In addition, a smooth transition from slow\nto fast eruptions is observed when increasing the strength of the background\nmagnetic field, simply because in a stronger field there is more free magnetic\nenergy at the catastrophic point available to be released during an eruption.\nThis suggests that fast and slow CMEs may have an identical driving mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 May 2007 12:44:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

Recent studies have confirmed that a system consisting\nof a flux rope embedded in a background field exhibits a catastrophic behavior,\nand the energy threshold at the catastrophic point may exceed the associated\nopen field energy. The accumulated free energy in the corona is abruptly\nreleased when the catastrophe takes place, and it probably serves as the main\nmeans of energy release for CMEs at least in the initial phase. Such a release\nproceeds via an ideal MHD process in contrast with nonideal ones such as\nmagnetic reconnection.
