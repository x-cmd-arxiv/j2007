Both the stellar-continuum-subtracted 8 um\nemission and the 24 um emission correlate with the extinction-corrected\nPa-alpha line emission, although neither relationship is linear. Simple models\nof stellar populations and dust extinction and emission are able to reproduce\nthe observed non-linear trend of the 24 um emission versus number of ionizing\nphotons, including the modest deficiency of 24 um emission in the low\nmetallicity regions, which results from a combination of decreasing dust\nopacity and dust temperature at low luminosities. Conversely, the trend of the\n8 um emission as a function of the number of ionizing photons is not well\nreproduced by the same models. The 8 um emission is contributed, in larger\nmeasure than the 24 um emission, by dust heated by non-ionizing stellar\npopulations, in agreement with previous findings. Two SFR calibrations, one\nusing the 24 um emission and the other using a combination of the 24 um and\nH-alpha luminosities (Kennicutt et al. 2007), are presented. No calibration is\npresented for the 8 um emission, because of its significant dependence on both\nmetallicity and environment.

The different partition functions are speculatively interpreted as\ncounting stable objects in the derived category of A-modules under different\nstability conditions; their relationship should then be an instance of wall\ncrossing in the space of stability conditions on this triangulated category.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 May 2007 16:59:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2007 09:17:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Sep 2008 19:10:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-07"}

In all five cases we identify a galaxy at the redshift of the CaII\nsystem with impact parameters up to ~24 kpc. In four out of five cases the\ngalaxies are luminous (L ~L*), metal-rich (Z ~Zsun), massive (velocity\ndispersion, sigma ~100 km/s) spirals. Their star formation rates, deduced from\nHalpha emission, are high, in the range SFR = 0.3 - 30 Msun/yr. In our\nanalysis, we paid particular attention to correcting the observed emission line\nfluxes for stellar absorption and dust extinction. We show that these effects\nare important for a correct SFR estimate; their neglect in previous low-z\nstudies of DLA-selected galaxies has probably led to an underestimate of the\nstar formation activity in at least some DLA hosts.

Linear tabling is a framework from which different\nmethods can be derived based on the strategies used in handling looping\nsubgoals. One decision concerns when answers are consumed and returned. This\npaper describes two strategies, namely, {\\it lazy} and {\\it eager} strategies,\nand compares them both qualitatively and quantitatively. The results indicate\nthat, while the lazy strategy has good locality and is well suited for finding\nall solutions, the eager strategy is comparable in speed with the lazy strategy\nand is well suited for programs with cuts. Linear tabling relies on depth-first\niterative deepening rather than suspension to compute fixpoints. Each cluster\nof inter-dependent subgoals as represented by a top-most looping subgoal is\niteratively evaluated until no subgoal in it can produce any new answers. Naive\nre-evaluation of all looping subgoals, albeit simple, may be computationally\nunacceptable. In this paper, we also introduce semi-naive optimization, an\neffective technique employed in bottom-up evaluation of logic programs to avoid\nredundant joins of answers, into linear tabling. We give the conditions for the\ntechnique to be safe (i.e. sound and complete) and propose an optimization\ntechnique called {\\it early answer promotion} to enhance its effectiveness.\nBenchmarking in B-Prolog demonstrates that with this optimization linear\ntabling compares favorably well in speed with the state-of-the-art\nimplementation of SLG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 May 2007 20:52:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-25"}

This\nlength is by definition the relaxation length of the slowest mode toward\nequilibrium transport. The model presented by Parteli, Duran and Herrmann\n[Phys. Rev. E 75, 011301 (2007)] predicts that the saturation length decreases\nto zero as the inverse of the wind shear stress far from the threshold. We\nfirst show that their model is not self-consistent: even under large wind, the\nrelaxation rate is limited by grain inertia and thus can not decrease to zero.\nA key argument presented by these authors comes from the discussion of the\ntypical dune wavelength on Mars (650 m) on the basis of which they refute the\nscaling of the dune size with the drag length evidenced by Claudin and\nAndreotti [Earth Pla.

We show that this saltating grain size, estimated\nfrom thermal diffusion measurements, is not reliable. Moreover, the microscopic\nphotographs taken by the rovers on Martian aeolian bedforms show a grain size\nof 87 plus or minus 25 micrometers together with hematite spherules at\nmillimetre scale. As those so-called ``blueberries'' can not be entrained by\nreasonable winds, we conclude that the saltating grains on Mars are the small\nones, which gives a second strong argument against the model of Parteli et al.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 May 2007 08:17:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Within this scheme the spin chain\nis used repeatedly as an entanglement bus (EB) to create multi-partite\nentanglement. The noise model we consider comprises of each spin of this EB\nbeing exposed to independent local noise which degrades the capabilities of the\nEB. Here we concentrate on quantifying its performance as a single-qubit\nchannel and as a mediator of a two-qubit entangling gate, since these are basic\noperations necessary for graph state generation using the EB. In particular,\nfor the single-qubit case we numerically calculate the average channel fidelity\nand whether the channel becomes entanglement breaking, i.e., expunges any\nentanglement the transferred qubit may have with other external qubits. We find\nthat neither local decay nor dephasing noise cause entanglement breaking. This\nis in contrast to local thermal and depolarizing noise where we determine a\ncritical length and critical noise coupling, respectively, at which\nentanglement breaking occurs. The critical noise coupling for local\ndepolarizing noise is found to exhibit a power-law dependence on the chain\nlength. For two qubits we similarly compute the average gate fidelity and\nwhether the ability for this gate to create entanglement is maintained.

They exhibit extremely high star formation rates, and\nmost of them seem to harbour an AGN. They are unique laboratories to\ninvestigate utmost star formation, and its connection to super-massive black\nhole growth. X-ray studies of HLIRGs have the potential to unravel the AGN\ncontribution to the bolometric output from these bright objects.\n  We have selected a sample of 14 HLIRGs observed by XMM-Newton (type 1, type 2\nAGN and starburst), 5 of which are candidates to be Compton-thick objects. This\nis the first time that a systematic study of this type of objects is carried\nout in the X-ray spectral band. Their X-ray spectral properties have been\ncorrelated with their IR luminosities, estimated by IRAS, ISO and sub-mm data.\n  The X-ray spectra of HLIRGs present heterogeneous properties. All our X-ray\ndetected HLIRGs (10) have AGN-dominated X-ray spectra. The hard X-ray\nluminosity of 8 of them is consistent with a pure AGN contribution, while in\nthe remaining 2 sources both an AGN and a starburst seem to contribute to the\noverall emission. We found soft excess emission in 5 sources. In one of them it\nis consistent with a pure starburst origin, while in the other 4 sources it is\nconsistent with an AGN origin. The observed X-ray emission is systematically\nbelow the one expected for a standard local QSO of the same IR luminosity,\nsuggesting the possible presence of absorption in type 2 objects and/or a\ndeparture from a standard spectral energy distribution of QSO. The\nX-ray-to-IR-luminosity ratio is constant with redshift, indicating similar\nevolutions for the AGN and starburst component, and that their respective power\nsources could be physically related.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 May 2007 14:47:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-08-29"}
