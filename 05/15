While, in\ngeneral, parton showers give a good description of the experimental data, the\nprecise functional form of the probability distribution underlying the event\ngeneration is generally not known. The reason is that realistic parton showers\nare required to conserve four-momentum at each vertex. In this paper we\ninvestigate in detail how four-momentum conservation is enforced in a standard\nparton shower and why this destroys the analytic control of the probability\ndistribution. We show how to modify a parton shower algorithm such that it\nconserves four-momentum at each vertex, but for which the full analytic form of\nthe probability distribution is known. We then comment how this analytic\ncontrol can be used to match matrix element calculations with parton showers,\nand to estimate effects of power corrections and other uncertainties in parton\nshowers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 May 2007 19:50:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Feb 2008 03:12:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

At present, observational constraints are consistent with\na cosmological constant and there is no firm evidence for any evolution in the\ndark energy equation of state w. In this paper, we pose the following question:\nsuppose that future dark energy surveys constrain w at low redshift to be\nconsistent with -1 to a percent level accuracy, what are the implications for\nmodels of dynamical dark energy? We investigate this problem in a\nmodel-independent way by following quintessence field trajectories in `energy'\nphase-space. Attractor dynamics in this phase-space leads to two classes of\nacceptable models: 1) models with flat potentials, i.e. an effective\ncosmological constant, and 2) models with potentials that suddenly flatten with\na characteristic kink. The prospect of further constraining the second class of\nmodels from distance measurements and fluctuation growth rates at low redshift\n(z<3) seems poor. However, in some models of this second class, the dark energy\nmakes a significant contribution to the total energy density at high redshift.\nSuch models can be further constrained from observation of the cosmic microwave\nbackground anisotropies and from primordial nucleosynthesis. It is possible,\ntherefore, to construct models in which the dark energy at high redshift causes\nobservable effects, even if future dark energy surveys constrain w at low\nredshift to be consistent with -1 to high precision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 May 2007 16:28:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 22 Jul 2007 19:33:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2007 15:05:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 26 Feb 2009 17:36:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-26"}

We\nillustrate our results by providing meaningful examples both for stable and\nunstable models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2007 14:00:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2008 14:08:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

Finally, we have used our cluster distances in\nconjunction with the disk geometry to calculate the distance to the LMC center,\nfor which we find (m-M)o = 18.40 +/- 0.04_{ran} +/- 0.08_{sys}, or Do = 47.9\n+/- 0.9 +/- 1.8 kpc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 May 2007 22:06:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

As in general\nrelativity, the spherically symmetric solution is seen to describe a black\nhole. The exterior geometry is essentially the same as in the Schwarzschild\ncase, with power-law corrections to the Newtonian potential. The behavior\ninside the black-hole region is different from the Schwarzschild case in that\nthe usual spacetime singularity gets replaced by a singular surface of a new\ntype, where all basic fields of the theory remain finite but metric ceases to\nexist. The theory does not admit arbitrarily small black holes: for small\nobjects, the curvature on the would-be horizon is so strong that non-metric\nmodifications prevent the horizon from being formed.

We show how the arrival\nand departure rates directly limit the capacity for message streams to be\nbroadcast to all other peers, by deriving mean field models that accurately\ndescribe the system behavior. Our models cover the unit and more general k\nbuffer cases, i.e. where a peer can buffer at most k messages at any one time,\nand we give results for both single and multi-source message streams.

Such precise control of single donor spin states is required\nparticularly in quantum computing applications of single donor electronics,\nwhich forms the driving motivation of this work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2007 04:28:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-10"}

I resolve this\ndilemma by showing how the SIR dynamics can be modeled with a system of three\nnonlinear ODE's. The method makes use of the probability generating function\n(PGF) formalism for representing the degree distribution of a random network\nand makes use of network-centric quantities such as the number of edges in a\nwell-defined category rather than node-centric quantities such as the number of\ninfecteds or susceptibles. The PGF provides a simple means of translating\nbetween network and node-centric variables and determining the epidemic\nincidence at any time. The theory also provides a simple means of tracking the\nevolution of the degree distribution among susceptibles or infecteds. The\nequations are used to demonstrate the dramatic effects that the degree\ndistribution plays on the final size of an epidemic as well as the speed with\nwhich it spreads through the population. Power law degree distributions are\nobserved to generate an almost immediate expansion phase yet have a smaller\nfinal size compared to homogeneous degree distributions such as the Poisson.\nThe equations are compared to stochastic simulations, which show good agreement\nwith the theory. Finally, the dynamic equations provide an alternative way of\ndetermining the epidemic threshold where large-scale epidemics are expected to\noccur, and below which epidemic behavior is limited to finite-sized outbreaks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2007 08:16:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The relation between spectral slope and flux (the spectrum\ngets bluer as the source flux increases) is well described by a power-law\nmodel, although there is significant scatter around the best-fitting model\nline.

The 3-body star-binary MBH interactions shrink the binary MBH to the\npoint where energy losses from the emission of gravitational waves (GW) lead to\nrapid coalescence. We model this process based on observed and simulated MP\ndistributions and take into account the decreased efficiency of the star-binary\nMBH interaction due to acceleration in the galactic potential. We show that\nmergers of gas-rich galactic nuclei lead to binary MBH coalescence well within\nthe Hubble time. Moreover, lower-mass binary MBHs (<10^8 Msun) require only a\nfew percent of the typical gas mass in a post-merger nucleus to coalesce in a\nHubble time. The fate of a binary MBH in a gas poor galactic merger is less\ncertain, although massive stellar structures (e.g. clusters, stellar rings)\ncould likewise lead to efficient coalescence. These coalescence events are\nobservable by their strong GW emission. MPs thus increase the cosmic rate of\nsuch GW events, lead to a higher mass deficit in the merged galactic core and\nsuppress the formation of triple MBH systems and the resulting ejection of MBHs\ninto intergalactic space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2007 12:39:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2007 06:07:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The competition of the different interactions is responsible for\nwhich broken-symmetry ground state is eventually realized in a specific\ncompound and which drives the system towards an insulating state.\n  Here we review the various ordering phenomena and how they can be identified\nby optic and magnetic measurements. While the final results might look very\nsimilar in the case of a charge density wave and a charge-ordered metal, for\ninstance, the physical cause is completely different. When density waves form,\na gap opens in the density of states at the Fermi energy due to nesting of the\none-dimension Fermi surface sheets. When a one-dimensional metal becomes a\ncharge-ordered Mott insulator, on the other hand, the short-range Coulomb\nrepulsion localizes the charge on the lattice sites and even causes certain\ncharge patterns.\n  We try to point out the similarities and conceptional differences of these\nphenomena and give an example for each of them.

In\nthis paper we study the critical behavior around the freezing transition, which\nappears in the unfrozen phase as the divergence of the sizes of the\nrearrangements induced in response to the modification of a variable. The\nformalism is developed on generic constraint satisfaction problems and applied\nin particular to the random satisfiability of boolean formulas and to the\ncoloring of random graphs. The computation is first performed in random tree\nensembles, for which we underline a connection with percolation models and with\nthe reconstruction problem of information theory. The validity of these results\nfor the original random ensembles is then discussed in the framework of the\ncavity method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2007 13:53:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-12-19"}

The bosonic sector of the supergroup is used to describe the complex\ncollective spectra of the neighboring even-even nuclei and is considered as a\ncore structure of the odd nucleus. The fermionic sector is represented by the\nfermion spin group $SO^{F}(2\\Omega)\\supset SU^{F}(2)$.\n  The so obtained, new exactly solvable limiting case is applied for the\ndescription of the nuclear collective spectra of odd mass nuclei.

The weak-lensing signal from a dense distribution of background\ngalaxies (~120 per square arcmin) across the cluster enables the derivation of\na high-resolution parameter-free mass map. The strongly-lensed objects tightly\nconstrain the mass structure of the cluster inner region on an absolute scale,\nbreaking the mass-sheet degeneracy. The mass reconstruction of Cl 0024+17\nobtained in such a way is remarkable. It reveals a ringlike dark matter\nsubstructure at r~75\" surrounding a soft, dense core at r~50\". We interpret\nthis peculiar sub-structure as the result of a high-speed line-of-sight\ncollision of two massive clusters 1-2 Gyr ago. Such an event is also indicated\nby the cluster velocity distribution. Our numerical simulation with purely\ncollisionless particles demonstrates that such density ripples can arise by\nradially expanding, decelerating particles that originally comprised the\npre-collision cores. Cl 0024+17 can be likened to the bullet cluster 1E0657-56,\nbut viewed $along$ the collision axis at a much later epoch. In addition, we\nshow that the long-standing mass discrepancy for Cl 0024+17 between X-ray and\nlensing can be resolved by treating the cluster X-ray emission as coming from a\nsuperposition of two X-ray systems. The cluster's unusual X-ray surface\nbrightness profile that requires a two isothermal sphere description supports\nthis hypothesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2007 15:52:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

Results obtained with the\nchemistry-transport model (CTM) Polair3D are compared to measurements of\ninorganic PM2.5. To understand to which extent the aerosol processes modeled in\nPolair3D impact simulated inorganic PM2.5, Polair3D is run with different\noptions in the aerosol module, e.g. with/without heterogeneous reactions. To\nquantify the impact of processes outside the aerosol module, simulations are\nalso done with another CTM (CMAQ). In the winter episode, sulfate is mostly\nimpacted by condensation, coagulation, long-range transport, and deposition to\na lesser extent. In the summer episode, the effect of long-range transport\nlargely dominates. The impact of condensation/evaporation is dominant for\nammonium, nitrate and chloride in both episodes. However, the impact of the\nthermodynamic equilibrium assumption is limited. The impact of heterogeneous\nreactions is large for nitrate and ammonium, and taking heterogeneous reactions\ninto account appears to be crucial in predicting the peaks of nitrate and\nammonium. The impact of deposition is the same for all inorganic PM2.5. It is\nsmall compared to the impact of other processes although it is not negligible.\nThe impact of nucleation is negligible in the summer episode, and small in the\nwinter episode. The impact of coagulation is larger in the winter episode than\nin the summer episode, because the number of small particles is higher in the\nwinter episode as a consequence of nucleation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2007 15:34:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
