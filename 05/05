The value of the mass renormalization depends upon the\nlattice actions used. This mixed meson mass shift is an important lattice\nartifact to determine for mixed action calculations; because it modifies the\npion mass, it plays a central role in the low energy dynamics of all hadronic\ncorrelation functions. We determine the leading order, $\\mathcal{O}(a^2)$, and\nnext to leading order, $\\mathcal{O}(a^2 m_\\pi^2)$, additive mass shift of\n\\textit{valence-sea} mesons for a mixed lattice action with domain-wall valence\nfermions and rooted staggered sea fermions, relevant to the majority of current\nlarge scale mixed action lattice efforts.

We find that the spectral energy distribution shows\na factor of ~4 rise in flux density between the 16 micron and 22 micron\nbandpass which is most likely due to the entrance of polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbon emission features into the 22 micron and 24 micron passbands.

For each nonzero\ncomplex number $q$, we construct a quantum vertex algebra $V_{q}$ and prove\nthat every $DY_{q}(sl_{2})$-module is naturally a $V_{q}$-module. We also show\nthat $DY_{q}^{\\infty}(sl_{2})$-modules are what we call\n$V_{q}$-modules-at-infinity. To achieve this goal, we study what we call\n$\\S$-local subsets and quasi-local subsets of $\\Hom (W,W((x^{-1})))$ for any\nvector space $W$, and we prove that any $\\S$-local subset generates a (weak)\nquantum vertex algebra and that any quasi-local subset generates a vertex\nalgebra with $W$ as a (left) quasi module-at-infinity. Using this result we\nassociate the Lie algebra of pseudo-differential operators on the circle with\nvertex algebras in terms of quasi modules-at-infinity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 May 2007 17:46:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We have replaced this differential equation by the\ncorresponding finite-time difference equation with d as the smallest span of\ntime. We have, then, symmetrized the equation so that it remains invariant\nunder the change d going to -d. This symmetric equation has solutions in pairs.\nThe angular speed w is modified to w' or w\". w' contains a part with an\ninteger. w\" contains a part with a half-integer. This corresponds to quantum\nmechanical oscillator energy levels. F= a.exp(iwt) describes oscillation\nbetween -a and +a. If we make w=0, F describes free oscillation between -a and\n+a. Reciprocal symmetric oscillator, thus, unifies quantum and classical\nharmonic oscillators on one hand, and a harmonic oscillator and a free particle\nin a potential well on the other hand. No quantum mechanical postulates are\ninvolved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 May 2007 06:24:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We define the bimeromorphic {\\it\ncategory} of geometric orbifolds. These interpolate between (compact K\\\" ahler)\nmanifolds and such manifolds with logarithmic structure. These geometric\norbifolds are considered from the point of view of their geometry, and thus\nequipped with the usual invariants of varieties: morphisms and bimeromorphic\nmaps, differential forms, fundamental groups and universal covers, fields of\ndefinition and rational points. The most elementary properties, directly\nadapted from the case of varieties without orbifold structure, are established\nhere. The arguments of [Ca01] can then be directly adapted to extend the main\nstructure results to this orbifold category. We hope to come back to deeper\naspects later. The motivation is that the natural frame for the theory of\nclassification of compact K\\\" ahler (and complex projective) manifolds includes\nat least the category of orbifolds, as shown in [Ca01] by the fonctorial\ndecomposition of {\\it special} manifolds as tower of orbifolds with either\n$\\kappa_+=-\\infty$ or $\\kappa=0$, and also, seemingly, by the minimal model\nprogram, in which most proofs work only after the adjunction of a \"boundary\".\n  Also, fibrations enjoy in the bimeromorphic category of geometric orbifolds\nextension properties not satisfied in the category of varieties without\norbifold structure, permitting to express invariants of the total space from\nthose of the generic fibre and of the base. For example, the natural sequence\nof fundamental groups is exact there; also the total space is special if so are\nthe generic fibre and the base.
