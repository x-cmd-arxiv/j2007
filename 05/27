Special attention needs to be devoted to the coupling to massless\ngauge fields (photon, gluon), since it is well known that loop effects may be\nimportant for these fields. We also present a detailed explanation of these\ncouplings from the CFT interpretation. We then use these couplings to determine\nthe radion branching fractions and discuss some of the discovery potential of\nthe LHC for the radion. We find that the gamma-gamma signal is enhanced over\nmost of the range of the radion mass over the gamma-gamma signal of a SM Higgs,\nas long as the RS scale is sufficiently low. However, the signal significance\ndepends strongly on free parameters that characterize the magnitude of bare\nbrane-localized kinetic terms for the massless gauge fields. In the absence of\nsuch terms, the signal can be be enhanced over the traditional RS1 models\n(where all standard model fields are localized on the IR brane), but the signal\ncan also be reduced compared to RS1 if the brane localized terms are sizeable.\nWe also show that for larger radion masses, where the gamma-gamma signal is no\nlonger significant, one can use the usual 4 lepton signal to discover the\nradion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 May 2007 23:41:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The\nmotivation for this (seemingly academic) endeavour is to take the background\nindependence intrinsic to Einstein gravity one step further, and to assure that\nboth the equations of motion and the way in which those equations of motion are\nderived are as self-consistent as possible. That is, solutions to the equations\nof motion of general relativity endow a three-space region with a physical and\ndistinguishing geometry in four-dimensional space-time. However, in order to\nderive these equations of motion one should first be able to choose a\nthree-space region without having any prior knowledge of its physically\nappropriate geometry. The expression of this choice process requires a\nthree-dimensional topological manifold Q, to which all considered three-space\nregions belong, and that generates an equation of motion whose solutions are q.\nThese solutions relate the effects of curvature to the source term through the\ntopology of Q and constitute Einstein gravity. Q is given by 2T^3+3S^1xS^2, and\nis embedded in four dimensions. This points toward a hidden topological content\nfor general relativity, best phrased as: Q and q provide a structure for how to\nchoose a three-space region irrespective of what geometric properties it has,\nwhile at the same time Q and q determine that only GR can endow a three-space\nwith those geometric properties.

The temperature/pressure profiles of the non-equilibrium models are\nfully consistent with the non-equilibrium chemistry. Our grid of\nnon-equilibrium models includes spectra for effective temperatures from 200 K\nto 1800 K, three surface gravities, four possible values of the coefficient of\neddy diffusion in the radiative zone, and three different CO/CH$_4$ chemical\nreaction prescriptions. We find that the non-equilibrium overabundance of CO\ntranslates into flux suppressions in the M ($\\sim4-$5 $\\mu$m) band of at most\n$\\sim$40% between effective temperatures of 600 and 1800 K. The effect is\nlargest around $T_{\\rm eff} \\approx 1100$ K.

The magnitude of the departure\nfrom chemical equilibrium increases with decreasing gravity, with increasing\neddy diffusion coefficient, and with decreasing speed of the CO/CH$_4$\nreaction. Though these effects are modest, they lead to better fits with the\nmeasured T dwarf spectra. Furthermore, the suppression in the M band due to\nnon-equilibrium enhancements in the CO abundance disappears below $\\sim$500 K,\nand is only partial above $\\sim$500 K, preserving the M band flux as a useful\ndiagnostic of cool atmospheres and maintaining its importance for searches for\nbrown dwarfs cooler than T dwarfs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 May 2007 00:58:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2007 18:39:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
