The very nature of\nbluffing is even open for debate, adding further complication to the process of\ncreating intelligent virtual players that can bluff, and hence play,\nrealistically. Through the use of intelligent, learning agents, and carefully\ndesigned agent outlooks, an agent can in fact learn to predict its opponents\nreactions based not only on its own cards, but on the actions of those around\nit. With this wider scope of understanding, an agent can in learn to bluff its\nopponents, with the action representing not an illogical action, as bluffing is\noften viewed, but rather as an act of maximising returns through an effective\nstatistical optimisation. By using a tee dee lambda learning algorithm to\ncontinuously adapt neural network agent intelligence, agents have been shown to\nbe able to learn to bluff without outside prompting, and even to learn to call\neach others bluffs in free, competitive play.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 May 2007 19:15:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

However, it has now been\nestablished that there are two types of bulges: ``classical bulges'' that are\ndynamically hot systems resembling (little) ellipticals, and ``pseudobulges'',\ndynamically cold, flattened, disk-like structures that could not have formed\nvia violent relaxation. Therefore thee question is whether at types Sa-Sbc,\nwhere both bulge types are found, the red-blue dichotomy separates galaxies at\nsome value of disk-to-bulge ratio, $B/T$, or, whether it separates galaxies of\ndifferent bulge type, irrespective of their $B/T$. We identify classical bulges\nand pseudobulges morphologically with HST images in a sample of nearby\ngalaxies.

We show that at\nleast 40% of NGC 6791's evolved stars must have lost enough mass on the red\ngiant branch to avoid the flash, and therefore did not convert helium into\ncarbon-oxygen in their core. Such increased mass loss in the evolution of the\nprogenitors of these stars is consistent with the presence of the extreme\nhorizontal branch in the CMD. This unique stellar evolutionary channel also\nnaturally explains the recent finding of a very young age (2.4 Gyr) for NGC\n6791 from white dwarf cooling theory; helium core white dwarfs in this cluster\nwill cool ~3 times slower than carbon-oxygen core stars and therefore the\ncorrected white dwarf cooling age is in fact ~7 Gyr, consistent with the well\nmeasured main-sequence turnoff age.

We report a sensitive upper limit on its radio flux density of 12 uJy\nat 2 GHz using the NRAO GBT. Timing using XMM and Chandra over a 2.4 yr span\nreveals no significant change in its spin period. The 2 sigma upper limit on\nthe period derivative leads, in the dipole spin-down formalism, to an energy\nloss rate E-dot < 7e33 ergs/s, surface magnetic field strength B_p < 1.5e11 G,\nand characteristic age tau_c = P/2P-dot > 8 Myr. This tau_c exceeds the age of\nthe SNR by 3 orders of magnitude, implying that the pulsar was born spinning at\nits current period. However, the X-ray luminosity of PSR J1852+0040, L(bol) ~\n3e33(d/7.1 kpc)^2 ergs/s is a large fraction of E-dot, which challenges the\nrotation-powered assumption. Instead, its high blackbody temperature,\n0.46+/-0.04 keV, small blackbody radius ~ 0.8 km, and large pulsed fraction, ~\n80%, may be evidence of accretion onto a polar cap, possibly from a fallback\ndisk made of supernova debris.

Here we consider the detectability of\nthis effect. The anisotropy is largest when HII regions are large and expand\nrapidly, and we find that if bright quasars contributed to the early stages of\nreionization, then they can produce significant anisotropy, on scales\ncomparable to the typical sizes of HII regions of the bright quasars (approx.\n30 Mpc and below).

For most of these afterglows, the X-ray spectral slope and the decay\nindices before and after the break can be accommodated by the standard jet\nmodel although a different origin of the breaks cannot be ruled out.

In one important mesh\nprimitive, called a mesh update, each mesh vertex stores a value and repeatedly\nupdates this value based on the values stored in all neighboring vertices. The\nperformance of a mesh update depends on the layout of the mesh in memory.\n  This paper shows how to find a memory layout that guarantees that the mesh\nupdate has asymptotically optimal memory performance for any set of memory\nparameters. Such a memory layout is called cache-oblivious. Formally, for a\n$d$-dimensional mesh $G$, block size $B$, and cache size $M$ (where\n$M=\\Omega(B^d)$), the mesh update of $G$ uses $O(1+|G|/B)$ memory transfers.\nThe paper also shows how the mesh-update performance degrades for smaller\ncaches, where $M=o(B^d)$.\n  The paper then gives two algorithms for finding cache-oblivious mesh layouts.\nThe first layout algorithm runs in time $O(|G|\\log^2|G|)$ both in expectation\nand with high probability on a RAM.

High Speed Machining highlights some drawbacks of such\narchitectures: heavy moving parts require from the machine structure high\nstiffness to limit bending problems that lower the machine accuracy, and limit\nthe dynamic performances of the feed axes. That is why PKMs attract more and\nmore researchers and companies, because they are claimed to offer several\nadvantages over their serial counterparts, like high structural rigidity and\nhigh dynamic capacities. Indeed, the parallel kinematic arrangement of the\nlinks provides higher stiffness and lower moving masses that reduce inertia\neffects. Thus, PKMs have better dynamic performances. However, the design of a\nparallel kinematic machine tool (PKMT) is a hard task that requires further\nresearch studies before wide industrial use can be expected.

Here we\npresent such an analysis using the photometric transit timing variation\n($TTV_p$). We examined the light curve effects of both the transiting planet\nand its satellite. We define the photometric central time of the transit that\nis equivalent to the transit of a fixed photocenter. This point orbits the\nbarycenter, and leads to the photometric transit timing variations. The exact\nvalue of $TTV_p$ depends on the ratio of the density, the mass, and the size of\nthe satellite and the planet. Since two of those parameters are independent, a\nreliable estimation of the density ratio leads to an estimation of the size and\nthe mass of the exomoon. Upper estimations of the parameters are possible in\nthe case when an upper limit of $TTV_p$ is known. In case the density ratio\ncannot be estimated reliably, we propose an approximation with assuming equal\ndensities. The presented photocenter $TTV_p$ analysis predicts the size of the\nsatellite better than the mass. We simulated transits of the Earth-Moon system\nin front of the Sun. The estimated size and mass of the Moon are 0.020\nEarth-mass and 0.274 Earth-size if equal densities are assumed. This result is\ncomparable to the real values within a factor of 2. If we include the real\ndensity ratio (about 0.6), the results are 0.010 Earth-Mass and 0.253\nEarth-size, which agree with the real values within 20%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 May 2007 08:36:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Currently, physics processes dominating the evolution\nof a SMBHB are unclear. An interesting question is whether we could\nobservationally determine the evolution of SMBHB and give constraints on the\nphysical processes. Jet precession have been observed in many AGNs and\ngenerally attributed to disk precession. In this paper we calculate the time\nvariation of jet precession and conclude that jet precession is accelerated in\nSMBHB systems but decelerated in others. The acceleration of jet precession\n$dP_{\\rm pr} / dt$ is related to jet precession timescale $P_{\\rm pr}$ and\nSMBHB evolution timescale $\\tau_{\\rm a}$, ${dP_{\\rm pr} \\over dt} \\simeq -\n\\Lambda {P_{\\rm pr} \\over \\tau_{\\rm a}}$. Our calculations based on the models\nfor jet precession and SMBHB evolution show that $dP_{\\rm pr} / dt$ can be as\nhigh as about $- 1.0$ with a typical value -0.2 and can be easily detected. We\ndiscussed the differential jet precession for NGC1275 observed in the\nliterature. If the observed rapid acceleration of jet precession is true, the\njet precession is due to the orbital motion of an unbound SMBHB with mass ratio\n$q\\approx 0.76$.

In order to\ninvestigate this phenomenon we present a simple hybrid cellular automaton model\nof cell colony growth. In the model the growth of the colony is limited by a\nnutrient that is consumed by the cells and which inhibits cell division if it\nfalls below a certain threshold. Using this model we have investigated how the\nnutrient consumption rate of the cells affects the growth dynamics of the\ncolony. We found that for low consumption rates the colony takes on a Eden-like\nmorphology, while for higher consumption rates the morphology of the colony is\nbranched with a fractal geometry. These findings are in agreement with previous\nresults, but the simplicity of the model presented here allows for a linear\nstability analysis of the system. By observing that the local growth of the\ncolony is proportional to the flux of the nutrient we derive an approximate\ndispersion relation for the growth of the colony interface. This dispersion\nrelation shows that the stability of the growth depends on how far the nutrient\npenetrates into the colony. For low nutrient consumption rates the penetration\ndistance is large, which stabilises the growth, while for high consumption\nrates the penetration distance is small, which leads to unstable branched\ngrowth. When the penetration distance vanishes the dispersion relation is\nreduced to the one describing Laplacian growth without ultra-violet\nregularisation. The dispersion relation was verified by measuring how the\naverage branch width depends on the consumption rate of the cells and shows\ngood agreement between theory and simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 May 2007 12:45:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
