These motions appear to be subsonic and\nsignificantly below the escape velocity of the globule. Comparison of our\nobservations with near-infrared extinction data indicate that the globule is\ngravitationally bound.

The HCO+ and CS spectra show clear self-reversed and\nasymmetric profiles across the face of the globule. The sense of the observed\nasymmetry is indicative of the global presence of expansion motions in the\nouter layers of the globule. These motions appear to be subsonic and\nsignificantly below the escape velocity of the globule. Comparison of our\nobservations with near-infrared extinction data indicate that the globule is\ngravitationally bound. Taken together these considerations lead us to suggest\nthat the observed expansion has its origin in an oscillatory motion of the\nouter layers of the globule which itself is likely in a quasi-stable state near\nhydrostatic equilibrium. Analysis of the observed linewidths of CO and N2H+\nconfirm that thermal pressure is the dominant component of the cloud's internal\nsupport. A simple calculation suggests that the dominant mode of pulsation\nwould be an l = 2 mode with a period of 0.3 Myr. Deformation of the globule due\nto the large amplitude l = 2 oscillation may be responsible for the\ndouble-peaked structure of the core detected in high resolution extinction\nmaps. Detailed comparison of the molecular-line observations and extinction\ndata provides evidence for significant depletion of C18O and perhaps HCO+ while\nN2H+ may be undepleted to a cloud depth of about 40 magnitudes of visual\nextinction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 May 2007 17:03:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

By comparing the MLCS2k2 fits used in that study\nto the results from other light-curve fitters applied to the same data, we\ndemonstrate that this is related to the interpretation of SN color excesses\n(after correction for a light-curve shape-color relation) and the presence of a\ncolor gradient across the local sample. If the slope of the linear relation\n($\\beta$) between SN color excess and luminosity is fit empirically, then the\nbubble disappears.

We\ndemonstrate that SN data give $\\beta \\simeq 2$, instead of the $\\beta \\simeq 4$\none would expect from purely Milky-Way-like dust.

In steady state, self-consistency between the two rates of drift\nrequires that a relationship exists between the coefficients of turbulent\nviscosity and turbulent resistivity. Ignoring any interactions with a stellar\nmagnetosphere, we solve the steady-state equations for a magnetized disk under\nthe gravitational attraction of a mass point and threaded by an amount of\nmagnetic flux consistent with calculations of magnetized gravitational collapse\nin star formation.

For a linear data model, a number of known and\nnovel reconstruction schemes, which differ in terms of the underlying signal\nprior, data likelihood, and numerical inverse extra-regularization schemes are\nderived and classified. The Bayesian methodology presented in this paper tries\nto unify and extend the following methods: Wiener-filtering, Tikhonov\nregularization, Ridge regression, Maximum Entropy, and inverse regularization\ntechniques. The inverse techniques considered here are the asymptotic\nregularization, the Jacobi, Steepest Descent, Newton-Raphson,\nLandweber-Fridman, and both linear and non-linear Krylov methods based on\nFletcher-Reeves, Polak-Ribiere, and Hestenes-Stiefel Conjugate Gradients.

Using such an implementation of the generalized Wiener-filter in\nthe novel ARGO-software package, the different numerical schemes are\nbenchmarked with 1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional problems including structured white\nand Poissonian noise, data windowing and blurring effects. A novel numerical\nKrylov scheme is shown to be superior in terms of performance and fidelity.\nThese fast inverse methods ultimately will enable the application of sampling\ntechniques to explore complex joint posterior distributions.

To improve the performance of the\nMulti-Band OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex) solution proposed by\nthe Multi-Band OFDM Alliance (MBOA), the addition of a spreading component in\nthe frequency domain is a good solution since it makes resource allocation\neasier and also offers better robustness against channel frequency selectivity\nand narrowband interference. The Spread Spectrum - Multi-Carrier - Multiple\nAccess (SS-MC-MA) system proposed in this article offers not only the\nadvantages of Multi-Carrier - Coded Division Multiple Access (MC-CDMA) brought\nby frequency spreading, but also a more effective dynamic resource allocation\nin a multi-user and multi-piconet context. These improvements are obtained\nwithout increasing the complexity of the radio-frequency part compared to the\nclassical MBOA solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 May 2007 10:05:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We\ninvestigate the nature of this absorber by comparing its properties with those\nof different classes of absorbers (weak MgII, Damped Ly-alpha systems and local\ninterstellar clouds) and reproducing its ionization conditions with\nphotoionization models. The observed absorber belongs to the class of weak MgII\nsystems on the basis of its equivalent width, however the relative strength of\ncommonly observed transitions deviates significantly from those of the above\nmentioned absorbers. A rough estimate of the probability to cross such a system\nwith a QSO line of sight is P~0.03.

We\nperformed VLA observations of the NH3 (1,1) and (2,2) transitions towards the\npre-stellar core L 1544 in order to measure the temperature gradient between\nthe high density core nucleus and the surrounding core envelope. Our VLA\nobservation for the first time provide measurements of gas temperature in a\ncore with a resolution smaller than 1000 AU.

We have estimated the temperature gradient using a model of the source\nto fit our data in the u,v plane.

We have recently proposed a\nbinary-object formation model based on the notion of chaos-assisted capture.\nHere we present a more detailed analysis with calculations performed in the\nspatial (three-dimensional) three- and four-body Hill approximations. It is\nassumed that the potential binary partners are initially following heliocentric\nKeplerian orbits and that their relative motion becomes perturbed as these\nobjects undergo close encounters. First, the mass, velocity, and orbital\nelement distribu- tions which favour binary formation are identified in the\ncircular and elliptical Hill limits. We then consider intruder scattering in\nthe circular Hill four-body problem and find that the chaos-assisted capture\nmechanism is consistent with observed, apparently randomly distributed, binary\nmutual orbit inclinations. It also predicts asymmetric distributions of\nretrograde versus prograde orbits. The time-delay induced by chaos on particle\ntransport through the Hill sphere is analogous to the formation of a resonance\nin a chemical reaction. Implications for binary formation rates are considered\nand the 'fine-tuning' problem recently identified by Noll et al.
