There is a scalar field $\\phi$ in the bulk which, provided\na superpotential $W(\\phi)$, determines the warped geometry of the 5-D\nspacetime. This type of scenario is common in string theory, where the bulk\nscalar field $\\phi$ is related to the volume of small compact extra dimensions.\nWe show that, after the moduli are stabilized by supersymmetry breaking terms\nlocalized on the branes, the only relevant degrees of freedom in the bulk\nconsist of a 5-D massive spectrum of gravitons. Then we analyze the\ngravitational interaction between massive bodies localized at the positive\ntension brane mediated by these bulk gravitons.

The data show a\nwide range in degree of linear polarization among the sources, from $<$1% to\n$>$30%, and interday polarization variability in individual sources. The\npolarization properties suggest separation of the sample into three groups with\nlow, intermediate, and high variability of polarization in the core at 7 mm :\nLVP, IVP, and HVP, respectively. The groups are partially associated with the\ncommon classification of active galactic nuclei as radio galaxies and quasars\nwith low optical polarization (LVP), BL Lacertae objects (IVP), and highly\noptically polarized quasars (HVP). Our study investigates correlations between\ntotal flux, fractional polarization, and polarization position angle at the\ndifferent wavelengths. We interpret the polarization properties of the sources\nin the sample through models in which weak shocks compress turbulent plasma in\nthe jet. The differences in the orientation of sources with respect to the\nobserver, jet kinematics, and abundance of thermal matter external to the jet\nnear the core can account for the diversity in the polarization properties. The\nresults provide strong evidence that the optical polarized emission originates\nin shocks, most likely situated between the 3 mm and 7 mm VLBI cores.

The focus of the geometric approach is to describe\nthe geometry of phylogenetic mixture distributions for the two state random\ncluster model, which is a generalization of the two state symmetric (CFN)\nmodel. In particular, we show that the set of mixture distributions forms a\nconvex polytope and we calculate its dimension; corollaries include a simple\ncriterion for when a mixture of branch lengths on the star tree can mimic the\nsite pattern frequency vector of a resolved quartet tree. Furthermore, by\ncomputing volumes of polytopes we can clarify how ``common'' non-identifiable\nmixtures are under the CFN model. We also present a new combinatorial result\nwhich extends any identifiability result for a specific pair of trees of size\nsix to arbitrary pairs of trees. Next we present a positive result showing\nidentifiability of rates-across-sites models. Finally, we answer a question\nraised in a previous paper concerning ``mixed branch repulsion'' on trees\nlarger than quartet trees under the CFN model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 May 2007 02:43:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2007 11:27:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2007 18:40:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-11-08"}

We solve\nnumerically the general relativistic hydrodynamics and neutrino transfer\nequations simultaneously, treating neutrino reactions in detail under spherical\nsymmetry. As a result, we find that massive iron cores with ~10Msun\nunexpectedly produce a bounce owing to the thermal pressure of nucleons before\nblack hole formation. The features of neutrino signals emitted from such\nmassive iron cores differ in time evolution and spectrum from those of ordinary\nsupernovae. Firstly, the neutronization burst is less remarkable or disappears\ncompletely for more massive models because the density is lower at the bounce.\nSecondly, the spectra of neutrinos, except the electron type, are softer owing\nto the electron-positron pair creation before the bounce. We also study the\neffects of the initial density profile, finding that the larger the initial\ndensity gradient is, the more steeply the neutronization burst declines.\nFurther more, we suggest a way to probe into the black hole progenitors from\nthe neutrino emission and estimate the event number for the currently operating\nneutrino detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 May 2007 08:47:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-12"}

The\ninter-nuclear potential energy term converges if zero point vibrations are\nincorporated and this method can replace the Ewald sum method. Core energy\ncontributions to the ordering energy are stored exclusively in superlattice\nlines. The effect of electron-phonon interactions on ordering energy is of the\nsame order of magnitude as ordering energy near transition temperatures and\ncannot be ignored. Ising model and variants are incorrect in explaining alloy\nphase transitions as they ignore the role of electron-phonon interactions\nwithout justification. A theoretical formalism that incorporates the\nDebye-Waller Factor component of electron-phonon interactions in electronic\nstructure calculations already exists and must be adopted when modeling\ntemperature dependent phenomena. It is suggested that DWF correction will\naccount substantially for the discrepancy between experimental and theoretical\nordering energy in Ni3V.

All\nattempts so far to find a convincing theoretical explanation have failed, so\nthat one of the last hopes is the yet to be developed quantum theory of\ngravity. In this article, loop quantum gravity is considered as a candidate,\nwith an emphasis on properties which might play a role for the dark energy\nproblem. Its basic feature is the discrete structure of space, often associated\nwith quantum theories of gravity on general grounds. This gives rise to\nwell-defined matter Hamiltonian operators and thus sheds light on conceptual\nquestions related to the cosmological constant problem. It also implies typical\nquantum geometry effects which, from a more phenomenological point of view, may\nresult in dark energy.

SS Lep is a fairly nearby close binary showing the Algol\nparadox and a shell spectrum, both indicative of (past) mass transfer. To study\nthe process of mass transfer and its evolutionary consequences, we aim at a\ndirect characterisation of the spatial dimensions of the different components\nof SS Lep with IR interferometry. We use VINCI/VLTI interferometric\nobservations in the K band and photometric observations from the UV to the\nfar-IR. The visibilities are interpreted with simple geometrical models and the\nSpectral Energy Distribution (SED) is decomposed into the three main\ncomponents: A star, M star and dust shell/disk. From the SED, we find that the\nmain emitters in the K band are the M star and the circumstellar environment.\nBoth are spatially resolved with the VINCI observations, showing the excess to\nbe circumbinary and showing the M star to have a size equal to its Roche Lobe.\nWe conclude that we have, for the first time, directly resolved a star filling\nits Roche Lobe. The resulting mass transfer is probably the cause of (1) the\ncircumbinary dust disk of which we see the hot inner region spatially resolved\nin our observations, (2) the unusually high luminosity of the A star and (3)\nthe shell spectrum seen in the UV and optical spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 May 2007 15:13:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
