In Kerr geometry, the field equations are not fully separable in the\ntime domain, and one has to tackle them in 2+1 dimensions (two spatial\ndimensions and time; the azimuthal dependence is still separable). A technical\ndifficulty arises when the source of the field is a pointlike particle, as the\n2+1-dimensional perturbation is then singular: Each of the azimuthal modes\ndiverges logarithmically at the particle.

We focus on the dynamical role of MHD processes after the formation of a\nmillisecond-period protoneutron star. We find that including magnetic fields\nand stresses can lead to a powerful explosion with an energy of a few Bethe,\nrather than a weak one of at most 0.1 Bethe, with an associated ejecta mass of\n~0.1Msun, instead of a few 0.001Msun. The core is spun down by ~30% within\n500ms after bounce, and the rotational energy extracted from the core is\nchanneled into magnetic energy that generates a strong magnetically-driven\nwind, rather than a weak neutrino-driven wind. Baryon loading of the ejecta,\nwhile this wind prevails, precludes it from becoming relativistic. This\nsuggests that a GRB is not expected to emerge from such AICs during the early\nprotoneutron star phase, except in the unlikely event that the massive white\ndwarf has sufficient mass to lead to black hole formation. In addition, we\npredict both negligible 56Ni-production (that should result in an\noptically-dark, adiabatically-cooled explosion) and the ejection of 0.1Msun of\nmaterial with an electron fraction of 0.1-0.2. Such pollution by neutron-rich\nnuclei puts strong constraints on the possible rate of such AICs. Moreover,\nbeing free from ``fallback,'' such highly-magnetized millisecond-period\nprotoneutron stars may later become magnetars, and the magnetically-driven\nwinds may later transition to Poynting-flux-dominated, relativistic winds,\neventually detectable as GRBs at cosmological distances. However, the low\nexpected event rate of AICs will constrain them to be, at best, a small subset\nof GRB and/or magnetar progenitors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 May 2007 23:17:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2007 16:23:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Data fusion, which fuses the collected data before\nthey are sent to the base station, is usually implemented over the network.\nSince the sensor is typically placed in locations accessible to malicious\nattackers, information assurance of the data fusion process is very important.\nA witness-based approach has been proposed to validate the fusion data. In this\napproach, the base station receives the fusion data and \"votes\" on the data\nfrom a randomly chosen sensor node. The vote comes from other sensor nodes,\ncalled \"witnesses,\" to verify the correctness of the fusion data. Because the\nbase station obtains the vote through the chosen node, the chosen node could\nforge the vote if it is compromised. Thus, the witness node must encrypt the\nvote to prevent this forgery. Compared with the vote, the encryption requires\nmore bits, increasing transmission burden from the chosen node to the base\nstation. The chosen node consumes more power. This work improves the\nwitness-based approach using direct voting mechanism such that the proposed\nscheme has better performance in terms of assurance, overhead, and delay. The\nwitness node transmits the vote directly to the base station. Forgery is not a\nproblem in this scheme. Moreover, fewer bits are necessary to represent the\nvote, significantly reducing the power consumption. Performance analysis and\nsimulation results indicate that the proposed approach can achieve a 40 times\nbetter overhead than the witness-based approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 May 2007 02:56:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-28"}

Furthermore, we confirmed with a higher spatial accuracy the point-like\nnature of this X-ray source. Optical and infrared observations were taken in B,\nV, r', i', J, H and Ks filters using the Keck, VLT, Blanco and Magellan\ntelescopes, while radio observations were obtained from the ATNF Parkes single\ndish at 2.9GHz and 708MHz. No plausible optical and/or infrared counterpart for\nRBS 1774 was detected within the refined sub-arsecond Chandra X-ray error\ncircle. Present upper limits to the optical and infrared magnitudes are r'>25.7\nand J>22.6 (5 sigma confidence level). Radio observations did not show evidence\nfor radio pulsations down to a luminosity at 1.4 GHz of L < 0.02 mJy kpc^2, the\ndeepest limit up to date for any XDINS, and lower than what expected for the\nmajority of radio pulsars. We can hence conclude that, if RBS 1774 is active as\nradio pulsar, its non detection is more probably due to a geometrical bias\nrather than to a luminosity bias. Furthermore, no convincing evidence for\nRRAT-like radio bursts have been found. Our results on RBS 1774 are discussed\nand compared with the known properties of other thermally emitting neutron\nstars and of the radio pulsar population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 May 2007 08:45:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2007 14:42:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

Zero-point radiation derives from quantic fluctuations in space, and the\nwavelength of its photons with the greatest energy is inversely proportional to\nthe curvature of space.\n  2. The Universe began as the breaking in of photons of extremely high energy\ncontained in the 3-dimensional surface: $w^2+x^2+y^2+z^2=R^2_i$, whose radius\nhas continued to expand at the speed of ligth since its origin at $t=0$.\n  3. The wavelength of the photons is quantized and the quantum of wavelength\nis invariable.\n  These propositions imply that the value of the total energy of the zero-point\nradiation in the Universe remains constant and the condition $w^2 + x^2 + y^2 +\nz^2 = (R_i + ct)^2 = R_u^2$ determines that every point in our space is subject\nto a tension whose intensity $i$ is proportional to the curvature $1/R_u$. Any\nincrease of $R_u$ implies a decrease in $i$ and consequently an energy flow\nwhich translates into an expansive force. Therefore, the Universe will expand\nindefinitely: no Big Crunch is possible. If the initial radius of the Universe\n$R_i$ has been smaller than the Schwarzschild radius, $R_s$, which corresponds\nto the total mass of the Universe, $M_u$, the generation of matter would have\nlasted for thousands of millions of years.

Prominent examples of difficult (that is,\nVNP-complete) problems in this model includes the permanent and hamiltonian\npolynomials. While the permanent and hamiltonian polynomials in general are\ndifficult to evaluate, there have been research on which special cases of these\npolynomials admits efficient evaluation. For instance, Barvinok has shown that\nif the underlying matrix has bounded rank, both the permanent and the\nhamiltonian polynomials can be evaluated in polynomial time, and thus are in\nVP. Courcelle, Makowsky and Rotics have shown that for matrices of bounded\ntreewidth several difficult problems (including evaluating the permanent and\nhamiltonian polynomials) can be solved efficiently. An earlier result of this\nflavour is Kasteleyn's theorem which states that the sum of weights of perfect\nmatchings of a planar graph can be computed in polynomial time, and thus is in\nVP also.
