This survey provides a high quality set of spectroscopic data for\n~6000 galaxies in 48 clusters. A salient feature of this model is the\npossibility of treating dust extinction as a function of age, allowing younger\nstars to be more obscured than older ones. Our technique, for the first time,\ntakes into account this feature in a spectral fitting code. A set of template\nspectra spanning a wide range of star formation histories is built, with\nfeatures closely resembling those of typical spectra in our sample in terms of\nspectral resolution, noise and wavelength coverage. Our method of analyzing\nthese spectra allows us to test the reliability and the uncertainties related\nto each physical parameter we are inferring. The well-known degeneracy problem,\ni.e. the non-uniqueness of the best fit solution (mass and extinction in\ndifferent age bins), can be addressed by assigning adequate error bars to the\nrecovered parameters. The values found in this way, together with their error\nbars, identify the region of parameter space which contains all the possible\nsolutions for a given spectrum. A comparison test was also performed on a WINGS\nsubsample, containing objects in common with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,\nyielding excellent agreement. We find that the stellar content as a function of\nage is reliably recovered in four main age bins and that the uncertainties only\nmildly depend on the S/N ratio. The metallicity of the dominant stellar\npopulation is not always recoverable unambiguosly, depending on the Star\nFormation History pattern.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 May 2007 16:47:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Two compact bodies orbiting each\nother, such as a pair of black holes, lose energy to gravitational radiation.\nAs the system loses energy the bodies spiral towards each other. This causes\ntheir orbital speed and the amount of gravitational radiation to increase,\nproducing a characteristic ``chirp'' waveform in the LIGO sensitive band. In\nthis thesis, matched filtering of LIGO science data is used to search for low\nmass binary systems in the halo of dark matter surrounding the Milky Way.\nObservations of gravitational microlensing events of stars in the Large\nMagellanic Cloud suggest that some fraction of the dark matter in the halo may\nbe in the form of Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs).

In this theory, the graviton becomes massive when general covariance\nis spontaneously broken through the introduction of a field that links two\nmetrics, one of the which will eventually decouple. The excitation of this\n\"link\" field acts like a Goldstone boson in giving mass to the graviton. We\nwork out the graviton and Goldstone boson propagators explicitly by means of\ngauge fixing terms similar to the renormalizability gauges used in gauge\ntheories. With these propagators, we calculate the lowest order tree-level\ninteraction between two external energy momentum tensors. The result is\nindependent of the gauge parameter, but different from the prediction of\nmassless gravity theory, i.e., general relativity. This difference remains even\nif the mass of the graviton goes to zero, in which case it gives the van\nDam-Veltman-Zakharov (vDVZ) discontinuity between the propagators of a massive\nand massless linearized graviton. Moreover, we show that the Fierz-Pauli\ngraviton mass term can be considered as the ``unitary gauge'' of a more general\ntheory with an extra scalar field. We explicitly construct such a theory in\nwhich the vDVZ discontinuity arises with a graviton mass term that is different\nfrom the Fierz-Pauli mass term. This theory has a local Weyl symmetry under\nconformal transformations of the metric. In the case when the mass goes to\nzero, the Weyl summetry becomes a global symmetry. It is possible that the\nlocal Weyl symmetry will give a hint as to the form of the corresponding fully\nnonlinear theory having a nonzero graviton mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 May 2007 22:23:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The resulting shifts are indeed\nsensitive to different choices of the definition of the BAO scale, which needs\nto be kept in mind in the data analysis. We present a toy model to explain the\nphysical behavior of the shifts. We find that the BAO scale defined as in\nPercival et al. (2007) indeed shows very small shifts ($\\lesssim$ 1%) relative\nto the prediction in {\\it linear theory} in real space. The shifts can be\npredicted accurately for scales where the perturbation theory is reliable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 May 2007 06:26:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2007 01:18:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

It is given\nproof that the threshold for a $p$-positive distribution is simply expressed by\n$[\\lambda'(0)\\rho'(1)]^{-1}$. Besides this closed form threshold expression,\nthe $p$-positive distributions exhibit three additional properties. First, for\ngiven code rate, check degree and maximum variable degree, they are in some\ncases characterized by a threshold which is extremely close to that of the best\nknown check regular distributions, under the same set of constraints. Second,\nthe threshold optimization problem within the $p$-positive class can be solved\nin some cases with analytic methods, without using any numerical optimization\ntool.

The density matrix is studied in a formalism which\nincludes generation of the ingoing state and absorption of the final state.\nThen the dependence of the final state on the conventional scattering amplitude\nfor the microsystem is highly non-linear.\n  In the thermodynamic limit of the macrosystem, the density matrix of the\nensemble (of microsystem plus macrosystem) develops into a final state which\ninvolves a set of macroscopically distinguishable states, each with the\nmicrosystem in one of the basis vector states and the macrosystem in an\nentangled state.\n  For an element of the ensemble, i.e., for a single measurement, the result is\ninstead a random walk, where the microsystem ends up in one of the basis vector\nstates (reduction of the wave packet).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 May 2007 13:44:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Independent of the star formation history, the DLAs\nhave a common characteristic of being weak star forming galaxies; models with\nhigh star formation efficiencies are ruled out. All the derived DLA star\nformation rates per unit area are moderate or low, with values between -3.2 <\nlog SFR < -1.1 M_sol yr^{-1} kpc^{-2}. The DLA abundance patterns require a\nlarge spread in ages ranging from 20 Myr up to 3 Gyr. The oldest DLA in our\nsample is observed at z_DLA=1.864 with an age estimated to more than 3 Gyr; it\nnicely indicates that galaxies were already forming at z_f>10. But, most of the\nDLAs show ages much younger than that of the Universe at the epoch of\nobservation. Young galaxies thus seem to populate the high redshift Universe at\nz>2, suggesting relatively low redshifts of formation (z~3) for most\nhigh-redshift galaxies. The DLA star formation properties are compared with\nthose of other high-redshift galaxies identified in deep imaging surveys with\nthe aim of obtaining a global picture of high-redshift objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 May 2007 14:41:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

It is found that all the\nvariational schemes have fail points, at where the variational schemes fail to\nprovide a lower energy (or a lower free energy at $T\\neq0$) than the\ndisplaced-oscillator ground state and therefore the variational ground state\nbecomes unstable, which results in a transition from a variational ground state\nto a displaced oscillator ground state when the fail point is reached. Such\ntransitions are always misidentied as crossover from a delocalized to localized\nphases in variational calculations, leading to an artifact of phonon-induced\nlocalization. Physics origin of the fail points and explanations for different\ntransition behaviors with different spectral functions are found by studying\nthe fail points of the variational schemes in the single mode case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 May 2007 15:20:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Sep 2007 04:47:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 30 Jun 2008 04:32:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-29"}

The PCA takes all the input data and projects\nit onto a lower dimension space, thereby reduc-ing the dimension of the input\nspace. This input reduction method often results with parameters that have\nsignificant influence on the dynamics of the data being diluted by those that\ndo not influence the dynamics of the data. The ARD selects the most relevant\ninput parameters and discards those that do not contribute significantly to the\ndynamics of the data being modelled. The ARD sometimes results with important\ninput parameters being discarded thereby compromising the dynamics of the data.\nThe PCA and ARD methods are implemented together with a Multi-Layer-Perceptron\n(MLP) network for fault identification in structures and the performance of the\ntwo methods is as-sessed. It is observed that ARD and PCA give similar\naccu-racy levels when used as input-selection schemes. There-fore, the choice\nof input-selection scheme is dependent on the nature of the data being\nprocessed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 May 2007 15:35:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

PSO is a good mix of both and the Simplex method returns local\nminima the most. A pre-processing stage should be investigated for the\nevolutionary methods in order to improve performance.
