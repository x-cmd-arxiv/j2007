(2) Strong\ncorrelations are found among some extinction properties within the UV region,\nand within the IR region.

(4) The large sightline-to-sightline\nvariation seen in our sample implies that any average Galactic extinction curve\nwill always reflect the biases of its parent sample. (5) The use of an average\ncurve to deredden a spectral energy distribution (SED) will result in\nsignificant errors, and a realistic error budget for the dereddened SED must\ninclude the observed variance of Galactic curves. While the observed large\nsightline-to-sightline variations, and the lack of correlation among the\nvarious features of the curves, make it difficult to meaningfully characterize\naverage extinction properties, they demonstrate that extinction curves respond\nsensitively to local conditions.

These oscillations are\npowered by release of the binding energy of matter falling into the strong\ngravitational field of the star or by the sudden nuclear burning of matter that\nhas accumulated in the outermost layers of the star. The frequencies of the\noscillations reflect the orbital frequencies of gas deep in the gravitational\nfield of the star and/or the spin frequency of the star. These oscillations can\ntherefore be used to explore fundamental physics, such as strong-field gravity\nand the properties of matter under extreme conditions, and important\nastrophysical questions, such as the formation and evolution of millisecond\npulsars. Observations using RossiXTE have shown that some two dozen neutron\nstars in low-mass X-ray binary systems have the spin rates and magnetic fields\nrequired to become millisecond radio-emitting pulsars when accretion ceases,\nbut that few have spin rates above about 600 Hz. The properties of these stars\nshow that the paucity of spin rates greater than 600 Hz is due in part to the\nmagnetic braking component of the accretion torque and to the limited amount of\nangular momentum that can be accreted in such systems. Further study will show\nwhether braking by gravitational radiation is also a factor.

Observational data spanning\nType Ia Supernovae, the cosmic microwave background (CMB), galaxy clustering,\nand weak gravitational lensing statistics are fit without requiring the two\nmeta-parameters to be equal.

However, new protein\nfunctions evolve when selection begins to favor other, \"promiscuous\" functions\nthat are incidental to a protein's biological role. If mutations that are\nneutral with respect to a protein's primary biological function cause\nsubstantial changes in promiscuous functions, these mutations could enable\nfuture functional evolution.\n  RESULTS: Here we investigate this possibility experimentally by examining how\ncytochrome P450 enzymes that have evolved neutrally with respect to activity on\na single substrate have changed in their abilities to catalyze reactions on\nfive other substrates. We find that the enzymes have sometimes changed as much\nas four-fold in the promiscuous activities. The changes in promiscuous\nactivities tend to increase with the number of mutations, and can be largely\nrationalized in terms of the chemical structures of the substrates. The\nactivities on chemically similar substrates tend to change in a coordinated\nfashion, potentially providing a route for systematically predicting the change\nin one function based on the measurement of several others.\n  CONCLUSIONS: Our work suggests that initially neutral genetic drift can lead\nto substantial changes in protein functions that are not currently under\nselection, in effect poising the proteins to more readily undergo functional\nevolution should selection \"ask new questions\" in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 May 2007 05:02:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-18"}

It sheds new light on the age old problem by thinking of the traditional\nalgorithms as working with images. Inspiration is drawn from an analogous\nsituation that is found in machine and human vision. Image processing\ntechniques are used to assist in the spatial indexing of the data. A fixed grid\napproach is used and bins with too many records are sub-divided hierarchically.\nSearch queries are pre-computed for bins that do not contain any data records.\nThis has the effect of dividing the search space up into non rectangular\nregions which are based on the spatial properties of the data. The bucketing\nquad tree can be considered as an image with a resolution of two by two for\neach layer. The results show that this method performs better than the quad\ntree if there are more divisions per layer. This confirms our suspicions that\nthe algorithm works better if it gets to look at the data with higher\nresolution images. An elegant class structure is developed where the\nimplementation of concrete spatial indexes for a particular data type merely\nrelies on rendering the data onto an image.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 May 2007 05:37:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

Such intermediate mass\nratio inspirals (IMRIs) are most likely to be found in globular clusters. We\nanalyze four possible IMRI formation mechanisms: (1) hardening of an NS-IMBH or\nBH-IMBH binary via three-body interactions, (2) hardening via Kozai resonance\nin a hierarchical triple system, (3) direct capture, and (4) inspiral of a\ncompact object from a tidally captured main-sequence star; we also discuss\ntidal effects when the inspiraling object is an NS.

We use recent data on noise levels in gene expression to show that it\nshould be possible to transmit much more than just one regulatory bit.\nRealizing this optimal information capacity would require that the dynamic\nrange of TF concentrations used by the cell, the input/output relation of the\nregulatory module, and the noise levels of binding and transcription satisfy\ncertain matching relations. This parameter-free prediction is in good agreement\nwith recent experiments on the Bicoid/Hunchback system in the early Drosophila\nembryo, and this system achieves ~90% of its theoretical maximum information\ntransmission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 May 2007 15:44:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-01"}

The upper\nlayers of this disk segment are magnetically-dominated, creating conditions\nappropriate for both photon bubble and Parker instabilities. We find little\nevidence for photon bubbles, even though the simulation has enough spatial\nresolution to see them and their predicted growth rates are high. On the other\nhand, there is strong evidence for Parker instabilities, and they appear to\ndominate the evolution of the magnetically supported surface layers. The disk\nphotosphere is complex, with large density inhomogeneities at both the\nscattering and effective (thermalization) photospheres of the evolving\nhorizontally-averaged structure. Both the dominant magnetic support and the\ninhomogeneities are likely to have strong effects on the spectrum and\npolarization of thermal photons emerging from the disk atmosphere. The\ninhomogeneities are also large enough to affect models of reflection spectra\nfrom the atmospheres of accretion disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 May 2007 15:53:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

Motivated by wavelength assignment for multicasts in optical\nnetworks, we introduce and study $n$-fibre colourings of labelled digraphs.\nThese are colourings of the arcs of $D$ such that at each vertex $v$, and for\neach colour $\\alpha$, $in(v,\\alpha)+out(v,\\alpha)\\leq n$ with $in(v,\\alpha)$\nthe number of arcs coloured $\\alpha$ entering $v$ and $out(v,\\alpha)$ the\nnumber of labels $l$ such that there is at least one arc of label $l$ leaving\n$v$ and coloured with $\\alpha$. The problem is to find the minimum number of\ncolours $\\lambda_n(D)$ such that the $m$-labelled digraph $D$ has an $n$-fibre\ncolouring. In the particular case when $D$ is $1$-labelled, $\\lambda_1(D)$ is\ncalled the directed star arboricity of $D$, and is denoted by $dst(D)$. We\nfirst show that $dst(D)\\leq 2\\Delta^-(D)+1$, and conjecture that if\n$\\Delta^-(D)\\geq 2$, then $dst(D)\\leq 2\\Delta^-(D)$. We also prove that for a\nsubcubic digraph $D$, then $dst(D)\\leq 3$, and that if $\\Delta^+(D),\n\\Delta^-(D)\\leq 2$, then $dst(D)\\leq 4$. Finally, we study\n$\\lambda_n(m,k)=\\max\\{\\lambda_n(D) \\tq D \\mbox{is $m$-labelled} \\et\n\\Delta^-(D)\\leq k\\}$.
