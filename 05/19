We study this \"collisional\" evolutionary\nregime using both fully self-consistent N-body integrations and approximate\nFokker-Planck models. The N-body integrations employ particle numbers up to\n0.26M and a direct-summation potential solver; close interactions involving the\nbinary are treated using a new implementation of the Mikkola-Aarseth chain\nregularization algorithm. Even at these large values of N, two-body scattering\noccurs at high enough rates in the simulations that they can not be simply\nscaled to the large-N regime of real galaxies. The Fokker-Planck model is used\nto bridge this gap; it includes, for the first time, binary-induced changes in\nthe stellar density and potential. The Fokker-Planck model is shown to\naccurately reproduce the results of the N-body integrations, and is then\nextended to the much larger N regime of real galaxies. Analytic expressions are\nderived that accurately reproduce the time dependence of the binary semi-major\naxis as predicted by the Fokker-Planck model.

Here the\nfirst (n-1) standard generators of the group act by (-q)-multiplication, while\nthe last one acts by (-t)-multiplication. The proof uses some technical results\nfrom previous papers plus computations over a suitable spectral sequence. The\nremaining cases follow from an application of Shapiro's lemma, by considering\nsome well-known inclusions: we obtain the rational cohomology of the Artin\ngroup of affine type \\tilde{A}_{n} as well as the cohomology of the classical\nbraid group {Br}_{n} with coefficients in the n-dimensional representation\npresented in \\cite{tong}. The topological counterpart is the explicit\nconstruction of finite CW-complexes endowed with a free action of the Artin\ngroups, which are known to be K(\\pi,1) spaces in some cases (including finite\ntype groups). Particularly simple formulas for the Euler-characteristic of\nthese orbit spaces are derived.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 May 2007 15:46:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
