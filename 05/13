The line is\nthought to be produced by iron fluorescence of a relatively cold X-ray\nilluminated material in the innermost parts of the accretion disc and provides\nan excellent diagnostic of accretion flows in the vicinity of black holes.\nPrevious studies have concentrated on the case of a thin, Keplerian accretion\ndisc. This disc must become thicker and sub-Keplerian with increasing accretion\nrates. These can affect the line profiles and in turn can influence the\nestimation of the accretion disc and black hole parameters from the observed\nline profiles. We here embark on, for the first time, a fully relativistic\ncomputation which offers key insights into the effects of geometrical thickness\nand the sub-Keplerian orbital velocity on the line profiles. We include all\nrelativistic effects such as frame-dragging, Doppler boost, time dilation,\ngravitational redshift and light bending. We find that the separation and the\nrelative height between the blue and red peaks of the line profile diminish as\nthe thickness of the disc increases. This code is also well-suited to produce\naccretion disc images. We calculate the redshift and flux images of the\naccretion disc and find that the observed image of the disc strongly depends on\nthe inclination angle.

The method is implemented in a\nmicrofluidic system with magnetic functionality. The fluidic structure within\nthe microsystem consists of an inlet and a single microfluidic channel with\nmultiple outlets. The magnetic functionality is provided by an array of\nintegrated soft-magnetic elements that are embedded transverse and adjacent to\nthe microchannel. The elements are magnetized using an external field, and once\nmagnetized they produce a magnetic force on blood cells as they flow through\nthe microchannel. In whole blood, white blood cells (WBCs) behave as\ndiamagnetic microparticles, while red blood cells (RBCs) exhibit diamagnetic or\nparamagnetic behavior depending on the oxygenation of their hemoglobin. We\nstudy the motion of blood cells through the microchannel using a mathematical\nmodel that takes into account the magnetic, fluidic and gravitational forces on\nthe cells. We use the model to study blood cell separation, and our analysis\nindicates that the microsystem is capable of separating WBC-rich plasma,\ndeoxygenated RBC-rich plasma and cell-depleted plasma into respective outlets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 May 2007 14:02:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
