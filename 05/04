These supernovae allow peculiar velocities\nto be measured at unprecedented precision. We have investigated in detail the\npossibility of a varying Hubble constant with redshift and found no evidence of\na monopole term for the nearby Universe. A large scale streaming motion is\nfound at an amplitude of about $340^{63}_{-71}$ km/sec, aligned in the\ndirection of $(l_0, b_0) = (312^{\\rm o}.0^{13.5}_{-7.4}, 25^{\\rm\no}.7^{8.0}_{-9.2})$, which is close to the direction of the center of Shapley\nsupercluster of galaxies. The large scale streaming motion is best fit by a\nfunction involving a strong bipolar term. The streaming velocity field extends\nfrom the lowest redshift ($\\sim 0.007$) to beyond 0.025 and likely out to even\nhigher redshifts. The velocity field at redshift below 0.01 can be equally well\ndescribed by a dipole field or by the same bipolar streaming velocity field\nthat reaches out to beyond $z \\sim 0.025$. We are also able to deduce a robust\nestimate of the random velocity component of the peculiar velocity field.\nWithin the volume of redshift below 0.01 (weighted average redshift of $\\sim$\n0.067), this thermal component is found to be about 270 km/sec. After\ncorrecting this smooth streaming motion, we are able to significantly improve\nthe Hubble expansion fits of these supernovae. The CMAGIC method gives a\ndramatic decrease of $\\chi^2$ from 90 to 63 for 69 degrees of freedom, and\nyields a residual scatter of only 0.12 magnitude; the maximum light method\ngives also a moderate improvement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 May 2007 19:44:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 May 2007 18:22:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The\nAC electrical conductivity of soil was measured using a pair of blade-like\nelectrodes while exposing the soil to periodic vibration. The blades were\npositioned longitudinally and transversally to the direction of the induced\nvibration to enable the calculation of a normalized index. The normalized index\nwas expected to provide data independent from the vibration strength and to\nreduce the effect of soil salinity and water content.

Measurement of dry\nsand showed a negative correlation between the normalized conductivity\nfluctuation and soil bulk density for both longitudinal and transversal\nsettings.

We distinguish two basic cases\nfor the reionization of a halo - internal reionization, whereby the stars\nforming in situ reionize their host galaxy, and external reionization, whereby\nthe progenitor of a galaxy is reionized by external radiation before its own\nstars are able to form in sufficient numbers.

We discuss three different cases of increasing complexity: (a) FZRP on\na rigid geometry where the network is fixed during the process, (b) FZRP on a\nrandom graph chosen from a given ensemble of networks, (c) FZRP on a dynamical\nnetwork whose topology continuously changes during the process in a way which\ndepends on the current distribution of particles. The case (a) provides a very\nsimple realization of the phenomenon of condensation which manifests as the\nappearance of a condensate of particles on the node with maximal degree. The\ncase (b) is very interesting since the averaging over typical ensembles of\ngraphs acts as a kind of homogenization of the system which makes all nodes\nidentical from the point of view of the FZRP. In the case (c), the distribution\nof particles and the dynamics of network are coupled to each other. The\nstrength of this coupling depends on the ratio of two time scales: for changes\nof the topology and of the FZRP. We will discuss a specific example of that\ntype of interaction and show that it leads to an interesting phase diagram.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 May 2007 07:48:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-25"}

A\ncompressive wave is set up in a constant sub-Jeans density distribution of\nradius r = 1 pc. As the wave travels through the simulation grid, a\nshock-bounded spherical shell is formed. The inner shock of this shell reaches\nand bounces off the center, leaving behind a central core with an initially\nalmost uniform density distribution, surrounded by an envelope consisting of\nthe material in the shock-bounded shell, with a power-law density profile that\nat late times approaches a logarithmic slope of -2 even in non-collapsing\ncases. The resulting density structure resembles a quiescent core of radius <\n0.1 pc, with a Bonnor-Ebert-like (BE-like) profile, although it has significant\ndynamical differences: it is initially non-self-gravitating and confined by the\nram pressure of the infalling material, and consequently, growing continuously\nin mass and size. With the appropriate parameters, the core mass eventually\nreaches an effective Jeans mass, at which time the core begins to collapse.\nThus, there is necessarily a time delay between the appearance of the core and\nthe onset of its collapse, but this is not due to the dissipation of its\ninternal turbulence as it is often believed.

A complete basis of homogeneous solutions for the interior and\nexterior regions, corresponding to all possible Dirichlet boundary values at\nthe interface, are calculated in a preprocessing step. This basis is used to\nconstruct the influence matrix which serves to transform the coupled boundary\nconditions into conditions on the interior problem.

The interface\ndipoles are characterized by monitoring the change in the surface work function\nupon adsorption of the SAM. We compare results obtained for SAMs in structures\nwith a different packing density of molecules, i.e. {$(\\sqrt{7}\\times\\sqrt{7})\nR19.1^{\\circ}$}, {$(\\sqrt{3}\\times\\sqrt{3}) R30^{\\circ}$}, and {p(2$\\times$2)}.\nThe work function of alkanethiolate SAMs on silver depends weakly on the\npacking density; that of fluorinatedalkanethiolates shows a stronger\ndependance. The results are analyzed in terms of two nearly independent\ncontributions to the interface dipole. These originate respectively from the\nmolecular dipoles and from a charge transfer between the metal surface and the\nmolecules. The charge transfer is determined by the silver--sulfur bond and it\nis independent of the electronegativity of the molecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 May 2007 15:39:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-09"}

Here we consider the case that the system is coupled to a\ntwo-dimensional phonon bath. In the resulting dynamic, transitions that\nconserve the system energy are forbidden, and the effects of the applied force\nand the interaction energies do not factorize (a so-called hard dynamic). In\nfull agreement with previous general theoretical results we find that the local\ninterface width changes dramatically with the applied force. However, in\ncontrast with other hard dynamics, this change is nonmonotonic in the driving\nforce. However, significant differences between theory and simulation are found\nnear two special values of the driving force, where certain transitions allowed\nby the solid-on-solid model become forbidden by the phonon-assisted dynamic.\nOur results represent a significant step toward providing a solid physical\nfoundation for kinetic Monte Carlo simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 May 2007 15:47:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-24"}
