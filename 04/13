We\nstudy these constraints in a model independent way, using a low energy\neffective theory from which the new physics is integrated out. We consider the\nmost important operators which contribute to top FCNCs and analyze the current\nconstraints on them. We find that the data rule out top FCNCs at a level\nobservable at the LHC due to most of the operators comprising left-handed first\nor second generation quark fields, while there remains a substantial window for\ntop decays mediated by operators with right-handed charm or up quarks.

On\nthe 1-arcsecond (about 725 AU) scale, the flattened distribution of molecular\ngas around HW2 appears to be due to the projected superposition, on the plane\nof the sky, of at least three protostellar objects, of which at least one is\npowering a molecular outflow at a small angle with respect to the line of\nsight. The presence of a protostellar disk around HW2 is not ruled out, but\nsuch structure is likely to be detected on a smaller spatial scale, or using\ndifferent molecular tracers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2007 16:46:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In both cases the response of the lithosphere to external\nforces can be calculated with the theory of thin elastic plates or shells. On\none-plate planets the spherical geometry of the lithospheric shell plays an\nimportant role in the flexure mechanism. So far the equations governing the\ndeformations and stresses of a spherical shell have only been derived under the\nassumption of a shell of constant thickness. However local studies of gravity\nand topography data suggest large variations in the thickness of the\nlithosphere. In this article we obtain the scalar flexure equations governing\nthe deformations of a thin spherical shell with variable thickness or variable\nYoung's modulus. The resulting equations can be solved in succession, except\nfor a system of two simultaneous equations, the solutions of which are the\ntransverse deflection and an associated stress function. In order to include\nbottom loading generated by mantle convection, we extend the method of stress\nfunctions to include loads with a toroidal tangential component. We further\nshow that toroidal tangential displacement always occurs if the shell thickness\nvaries, even in the absence of toroidal loads. We finally prove that the\ndegree-one harmonic components of the transverse deflection and of the toroidal\ntangential displacement are independent of the elastic properties of the shell\nand are associated with translational and rotational freedom.

We advocate an alternative hypothesis,\nthat the Solar System's protoplanetary disk had already formed when a very\nclose (< 1 pc) supernova injected radioactive material directly into the disk.\nWe conduct the first numerical simulations designed to answer two questions\nrelated to this hypothesis: will the disk be destroyed by such a close\nsupernova; and will any of the ejecta be mixed into the disk? Our simulations\ndemonstrate that the disk does not absorb enough momentum from the shock to\nescape the protostar to which it is bound. Only low amounts (< 1%) of mass loss\noccur, due to stripping by Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities across the top of the\ndisk, which also mix into the disk about 1% of the intercepted ejecta. These\nlow efficiencies of destruction and injectation are due to the fact that the\nhigh disk pressures prevent the ejecta from penetrating far into the disk\nbefore stalling. Injection of gas-phase ejecta is too inefficient to be\nconsistent with the abundances of radionuclides inferred from meteorites.

Secondly, we show\nthat the VC holds for a HN formal power series $P(z)$ if and only if, for any\npolynomial $f(z)$, $\\Delta^m (f(z)P(z)^m)=0$ when $m>>0$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2007 03:15:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-02"}

A quantum hologram has a higher storage\ncapacity compared to a classical hologram, and is capable of storing quantum\nfeatures of an image, such as multimode superposition and entangled quantum\nstates, something that a standard hologram is unable to achieve. Due to optical\nparallelism, the information capacity of the quantum hologram will obviously\nexceed that of a single-mode scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2007 11:33:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2007 10:43:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In this manuscript we report the\ndiscovery of a kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in 1A 1246-588. The\nkilohertz QPO was only detected when the source was in a soft high-flux state\nreminiscent of the lower banana branch in atoll sources. Only one kilohertz QPO\npeak is detected at a relatively high frequency of 1258+-2 Hz and at a single\ntrial significance of more than 7 sigma. Kilohertz QPOs with a higher frequency\nhave only been found on two occasions in 4U 0614+09. Furthermore, the frequency\nis higher than that found for the lower kilohertz QPO in any source, strongly\nsuggesting that the QPO is the upper of the kilohertz QPO pair often found in\nLMXBs. The full-width at half maximum is 25+-4 Hz, making the coherence the\nhighest found for an upper kilohertz QPO. From a distance estimate of ~6 kpc\nfrom a radius expansion burst we derive that 1A 1246-588 is at a persistent\nflux of ~0.2-0.3 per cent of the Eddington flux, hence 1A 1246-588 is one of\nthe weakest LMXBs for which a kilohertz QPO has been detected.

Using the X-ray spectral information we produce a\ncolour-colour diagram. The source behaviour in this diagram provides further\nevidence for the atoll nature of the source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2007 11:42:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

The rapid variations\nof the cross section with energy and angle indicate production of resonances.\nAn interpretation of the data within the Bonn-Gatchina partial wave analysis is\nbriefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2007 15:12:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

The light curves of\nHS1857+5144 display a sinusoidal variation with a period of Porb=383.52 min and\npeak-to-peak amplitudes of 0.7 mag and 1.1 mag in the B-band and R-band,\nrespectively.

A\nmodel atmosphere fit to the spectrum of the white dwarf obtained at minimum\nlight provides limits to its mass and temperature of Mwd=~0.6-1.0 Msun and\nTwd=~70000-100000 K, respectively.
