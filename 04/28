Three distinct phases\nare considered, namely the so-called spin-pseudospin, spin, and pseudospin\nphases.

In each case, we show that the\nelementary neutral excitations can be treated approximately as a set of\nn-independent kinds of boson excitations. The boson representation of the\nprojected electron density, the spin, pseudospin, and mixed spin-pseudospin\ndensity operators are derived. We then apply the developed formalism to the\neffective continuous model, which includes SU(4) symmetry breaking terms,\nrecently proposed by Alicea and Fisher.

Second, in selecting between a set of competing models,\ncalculation of the Bayesian evidence for each model is computationally\nexpensive.

Ongoing recurrent neuronal\nactivity, during memory recall or during sleep, has been hypothesized to\npreferentially potentiate strong synapses, preserving memories. This hypothesis\nhas not been evaluated in the context of a mathematical model representing\nbiochemical pathways important for L-LTP. I incorporated ongoing activity into\ntwo such models: a reduced model that represents some of the essential\nbiochemical processes, and a more detailed published model. The reduced model\nrepresents synaptic tagging and gene induction intuitively, and the detailed\nmodel adds activation of essential kinases by Ca. Ongoing activity was modeled\nas continual brief elevations of [Ca]. In each model, two stable states of\nsynaptic weight resulted. Positive feedback between synaptic weight and the\namplitude of ongoing Ca transients underlies this bistability. A tetanic or\ntheta-burst stimulus switches a model synapse from a low weight to a high\nweight stabilized by ongoing activity. Bistability was robust to parameter\nvariations. Simulations illustrated that prolonged decreased activity reset\nsynapses to low weights, suggesting a plausible forgetting mechanism.

The CFs have been calculated for both\nelectromagnetic and massless scalar fields in two cases, with and without\ntaking this periodicity into consideration. It turned out that only periodic\nCFs have some thermal features and particularly the Planck's factor with the\ntemperature T= h w /k . Regarding to the energy density of both electromagnetic\nand massless scalar field it is shown that the detector rotating in the\nzero-point radiation observes not only this original zero-point radiation but,\nabove that, also the radiation which would have been observed by an inertial\ndetector in the thermal bath with the Plank's spectrum at the temperature T.\nThis effect is masked by factor 2/3(4 gamma^2-1) for the electromagnetic field\nand 2/9 (4 gamma ^2-1) for the massless scalar field, where the Lorentz factor\ngamma=(1 - v^2 / c^2)^(1/2). Appearance of these masking factors is connected\nwith the fact that rotation is defined by two parameters, angular velocity w\nand the radius of rotation, in contrast with a uniformly accelerated linear\nmotion which is defined by only one parameter, acceleration a. Our calculations\ninvolve classical point of view only and to the best of our knowledge these\nresults have not been reported in quantum theory yet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Apr 2007 21:28:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The first approach is\nbased on a formal solution of the stress transport equation in which the\nproduction terms can be integrated exactly in terms of matrix exponentials.\nThis formal solution of the subgrid-scale stress transport equation is shown to\nbe useful to explore special cases, such as the response to constant velocity\ngradient, but neglecting pressure-strain correlations and diffusion effects.\nThe second approach is based on an Eulerian-Lagrangian change of variables,\ncombined with the assumption of isotropy for the conditionally averaged\nLagrangian velocity gradient tensor and with the `Recent Fluid Deformation'\n(RFD) approximation. It is shown that both approaches lead to the same basic\nclosure in which the stress tensor is expressed as the product of the matrix\nexponential of the resolved velocity gradient tensor multiplied by its\ntranspose. Short-time expansions of the matrix exponentials are shown to\nprovide an eddy-viscosity term and particular quadratic terms, and thus allow a\nreinterpretation of traditional eddy-viscosity and nonlinear stress closures.\nThe basic feasibility of the matrix-exponential closure is illustrated by\nimplementing it successfully in Large Eddy Simulation of forced isotropic\nturbulence. The matrix-exponential closure employs the drastic approximation of\nentirely omitting the pressure-strain correlation and other `nonlinear\nscrambling' terms.

We show through\nthe simulation that in a small range of reduced Rayleigh number $r$ ($770 < r <\n890$) the 2D rolls move chaotically in a direction normal to the roll axis. The\nlateral shift of the rolls may lead to global flow reversal of the convective\nmotion. The chaotic traveling rolls are observed in simulation with {\\it\nfree-slip} as well as {\\it no-slip} boundary conditions on the velocity field.\nWe show that the traveling rolls and the flow reversal are due to an interplay\nbetween the real and imaginary parts of the critical modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Apr 2007 11:53:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Dec 2008 17:31:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-05"}

The annular free flow model for $\\gamma$-ray emission\nof pulsars is suggested in this paper. It is emphasized that: (1). Two kinds of\nacceleration regions (annular and core) need to be taken into account. The\nannular acceleration region is defined by the magnetic field lines that cross\nthe null charge surface within the light cylinder. (2). If the potential drop\nin the annular region of a pulsar is high enough (normally the cases of young\npulsars), charges in both the annular and the core regions could be accelerated\nand produce primary gamma-rays. Secondary pairs are generated in both regions\nand stream outwards to power the broadband radiations. (3). The potential drop\nin the annular region grows more rapidly than that in the core region. The\nannular acceleration process is a key point to produce wide emission beams as\nobserved. (4). The advantages of both the polar cap and outer gap models are\nretained in this model. The geometric properties of the $\\gamma$-ray emission\nfrom the annular flow is analogous to that presented in a previous work by Qiao\net al., which match the observations well. (5). Since charges with different\nsigns leave the pulsar through the annular and the core regions, respectively,\nthe current closure problem can be partially solved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Apr 2007 14:35:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-03"}
