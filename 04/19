Adequate\nstellar atmosphere models are required for spectral analyses and mass-loss\ndeterminations. Present models can only account for the inhomogeneity of\nstellar winds in the approximation of small-scale structures that are optically\nthin. This treatment of ``microclumping'' has led to reducing empirical\nmass-loss rates by factors of two and more. Aims: Stellar wind clumps can be\noptically thick in spectral lines. We investigate how this ``macroclumping''\nimpacts on empirical mass-loss rates. Methods: The Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR)\nmodel atmosphere code is generalized in the ``formal integral'' to account for\nclumps that are not necessarily optically thin. Results: Optically thick clumps\nreduce the effective opacity. This has a pronounced effect on the emergent\nspectrum. Our modeling for the O-type supergiant zeta Puppis reveals that the\noptically thin H-alpha line is not affected by wind porosity, but that the PV\nresonance doublet becomes significantly weaker when macroclumping is taken into\naccount. The reported discrepancies between resonance-line and\nrecombination-line diagnostics can be resolved entirely with the macroclumping\nmodeling without downward revision of the mass-loss rate. Conclusions:\nMass-loss rates inferred from optically thin emission, such as the H-alpha line\nin O stars, are not influenced by macroclumping. The strength of optically\nthick lines, however, is reduced because of the porosity effects. Therefore,\nneglecting the porosity in stellar wind modeling can lead to underestimating\nempirical mass-loss rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2007 17:13:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2007 12:59:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-11-20"}

However, their\npremise is hinged upon an accurate mass-observable relationship, which could be\naffected by the (rather poorly understood) physics of the intracluster gas. In\nthis letter, using a semi-analytic model of the intracluster gas that\naccommodates various theoretical uncertainties, I develop a Fundamental Plane\nrelationship between the observed size, thermal energy, and mass of galaxy\nclusters. In particular, I find that M ~ (Y_{SZ}/R_{SZ,2})^{3/4}, where M is\nthe mass, Y_{SZ} is the total SZ flux or thermal energy, and R_{SZ,2} is the SZ\nhalf-light radius of the cluster. I first show that, within this model, using\nthe Fundamental Plane relationship reduces the (systematic+random) errors in\nmass estimates to 14%, from 22% for a simple mass-flux relationship. Since\nmeasurement of the cluster sizes is an inevitable part of observing the SZ\nclusters, the Fundamental Plane relationship can be used to reduce the error of\nthe cluster mass estimates by ~ 34%, improving the accuracy of the resulting\ncosmological constraints without any extra cost. I then argue why our\nFundamental Plane is distinctly different from the virial relationship that one\nmay naively expect between the cluster parameters. Finally, I argue that while\nincluding more details of the observed SZ profile cannot significantly improve\nthe accuracy of mass estimates, a better understanding of the impact of\nnon-gravitational heating/cooling processes on the outskirts of the\nintracluster medium (apart from external calibrations) might be the best way to\nreduce these errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2007 20:07:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2007 06:46:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-29"}

We examine its nature and\nsurroundings by analyzing the projected galaxy distribution, the galaxy\nvelocity distribution, the weak-lensing mass reconstruction, and the X-ray\nspectroscopy and imaging. The cluster shows a complex morphology. It is\ncomposed by at least two structures along the line-of-sight, with velocity\ndispersions of 592+-82 km s^-1 and 391+-85 km s^-1 respectively. Other\nstructures are also detected in X-ray, in the galaxy projected number density\nmap, and by weak-lensing. One of these clumps, could be gravitationally bound\nand associated to the main cluster. The derived temperature and bolometric\nX-ray luminosity reveal that [VMF 98] 097 behave like a normal cluster, in\nagreement with Lx-Tx correlation found for both local (z=0) and moderate\nredshift (z~0.4) clusters. We find that the mass determination inferred from\nweak-lensing is in average 3 to 4.8 times higher (depending on the model\nassumed) than the X-ray mass. We have two possible explanations for this\ndiscrepancy: i) the cluster is in non-equilibrium, then the deviation of the\nX-ray estimated mass from the true value can be as high as a factor of two; ii)\nthe intervening mass along the line-of-sight of the cluster is producing an\nover-estimation of the weak-lensing mass. Based on the analysis presented, we\nconclude that [VMF 98] 097 is a perturbed cluster with at least two\nsubstructures in velocity space and with other nearby structures at projected\ndistances of about 1 h^-1 Mpc.

Rather than a blessing, this feature is treated more as\nan interference-inducing nuisance in most wireless networks today (e.g., IEEE\n802.11). This paper shows that the concept of network coding can be applied at\nthe physical layer to turn the broadcast property into a capacity-boosting\nadvantage in wireless ad hoc networks. Specifically, we propose a\nphysical-layer network coding (PNC) scheme to coordinate transmissions among\nnodes. In contrast to straightforward network coding which performs coding\narithmetic on digital bit streams after they have been received, PNC makes use\nof the additive nature of simultaneously arriving electromagnetic (EM) waves\nfor equivalent coding operation. And in doing so, PNC can potentially achieve\n100% and 50% throughput increases compared with traditional transmission and\nstraightforward network coding, respectively, in multi-hop networks. More\nspecifically, the information-theoretic capacity of PNC is almost double that\nof traditional transmission in the SNR region of practical interest (higher\nthan 0dB). We believe this is a first paper that ventures into EM-wave-based\nnetwork coding at the physical layer and demonstrates its potential for\nboosting network capacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2007 08:15:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-13"}

The bound and scattering states are\nobtained in the center-of-mass frame, and then boosted from it to the Breit\nframe, where the evaluation of the relevant matrix elements of the\nelectromagnetic current operator is carried out. The latter includes, in\naddition to one-body, also two-body terms due to pion exchange, as obtained,\nconsistently with the OPEP, in pseudovector pion-nucleon coupling theory. The\nfull Lorentz structure of these currents is retained. In order to estimate the\nmagnitude of the relativistic effects we perform, for comparison, the\ncalculation with a non-relativistic phase-equivalent Hamiltonian and the\nstandard non-relativistic expressions for the one-body and two-body\npion-exchange currents. Our results for the electrodisintegration cross section\nshow that, in the calculations using one-body currents, relativistic\ncorrections become significant ({\\it i.e.}, larger than 10%) only at high\nmomentum transfer $Q$ ($Q^2 \\simeq 40$fm$^{-2}$ and beyond). However, the\ninclusion of two-body currents makes the relativistic predictions considerably\nsmaller than the corresponding non-relativistic results in the $Q^2$ region\n(18--40) fm$^{-2}$. The calculations based on the relativistic model also\nconfirm the inadequacy, already established in a non-relativistic context, of\nthe present electromagnetic current model to reproduce accurately the\nexperimental data at intermediate values of momentum transfers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2007 12:05:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We introduce a critical value such that the\nvacant set percolates for u below the critical value, and does not percolate\nfor u above the critical value. Our main results show that the critical value\nis finite when d is bigger or equal to 3, and strictly positive when d is\nbigger or equal to 7.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2007 15:45:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 May 2007 13:05:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2009 18:06:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-08"}
