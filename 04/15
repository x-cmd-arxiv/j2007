Orbital free methods attempt to\ncalculate this directly from the electron density by approximating the\nuniversal but unknown kinetic energy density functional. However simple local\napproximations are inaccurate and it has proved very difficult to devise\ngenerally accurate nonlocal approximations. We focus instead on the kinetic\npotential, the functional derivative of the kinetic energy DF, which appears in\nthe Euler equation for the electron density. We argue that the kinetic\npotential is more local and more amenable to simple physically motivated\napproximations in many relevant cases, and describe two pathways by which the\nvalue of the kinetic energy can be efficiently calculated. We propose two\nnonlocal orbital free kinetic potentials that reduce to known exact forms for\nboth slowly varying and rapidly varying perturbations and also reproduce exact\nresults for the linear response of the density of the homogeneous system to\nsmall perturbations. A simple and systematic approach for generating accurate\nand weak ab-initio local pseudopotentials which produce a smooth slowly varying\nvalence component of the electron density is proposed for use in orbital free\nDF calculations of molecules and solids. The use of these local\npseudopotentials further minimizes the possible errors from the kinetic\npotentials. Our theory yields results for the total energies and ionization\nenergies of atoms, and for the shell structure in the atomic radial density\nprofiles that are in very good agreement with calculations using the full\nKohn-Sham theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Apr 2007 16:31:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Even when the new node has just two choices, i.e., when\nk=2, the resulting network can be very different from a random graph or tree.\nFor instance, if the new node attaches to the contact which is closest to the\nroot of the tree, the distribution of depths changes from Poisson to a\ntraveling wave solution. If the new node attaches to the contact with the\nsmallest degree, the degree distribution is closer to uniform than in a random\ngraph, so that with high probability there are no nodes in the network with\ndegree greater than O(log log N). Finally, if the new node attaches to the\ncontact with the largest degree, we find that the degree distribution is a\npower law with exponent -1 up to degrees roughly equal to k, with an\nexponential cutoff beyond that; thus, in this case, we need k >> 1 to see a\npower law over a wide range of degrees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Apr 2007 17:23:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Functionally\nsimilar proteins can differ substantially in their robustness to mutations and\ncapacity to evolve new functions, but it has remained unclear whether any of\nthese differences might be due to evolutionary selection for these properties.\n  RESULTS: Here we use laboratory experiments to demonstrate that evolution\nfavors protein mutational robustness if the evolving population is sufficiently\nlarge. We neutrally evolve cytochrome P450 proteins under identical selection\npressures and mutation rates in populations of different sizes, and show that\nproteins from the larger and thus more polymorphic population tend towards\nhigher mutational robustness. Proteins from the larger population also evolve\ngreater stability, a biophysical property that is known to enhance both\nmutational robustness and evolvability. The excess mutational robustness and\nstability is well described by existing mathematical theories, and can be\nquantitatively related to the way that the proteins occupy their neutral\nnetwork.\n  CONCLUSIONS: Our work is the first experimental demonstration of the general\ntendency of evolution to favor mutational robustness and protein stability in\nhighly polymorphic populations. We suggest that this phenomenon may contribute\nto the mutational robustness and evolvability of viruses and bacteria that\nexist in large populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Apr 2007 19:42:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-16"}

The experiments by Zocher, Kaznacheev, and Dogic exhibited, that in\nthe sol phases of $V_2O_5-H_2O$, the tactoid droplets of $V_2O_5$ can coalesce.\nIn the magnetic field, this effect is associated with a gauge field action,\nviz. we consider coalescence (in the topologically more convenient term,\n\"junction\") of droplets as annihilation of topological defects, concerning with\nthe tactoid geometry. We have shown, that in the magnetic field, the tactoid\njunction is mainly caused by non-Abelian monopoles (vortons), whereas the\nAbelian defects almost do not annihilate.

Rotation is thought to be vital in the creation of\nLGRBs, and it is likely that black hole creation is also necessary.

In this\ncurrent work, a parametric study was carried out on both reaction and catalyst\nconditions. Results revealed that a thin Fe catalyst layer (about 0.5 nm)\nyielded rapid growth of SWNTs only when supported on Al2O3, and that Al2O3\nsupport enhanced the activity of Fe, Co, and Ni catalysts. The growth window\nfor the rapid SWNT growth was narrow, however.

Addition of H2 was also essential for rapid SWNT\ngrowth, but again, further addition decreased both the SWNT growth rate and\nquality.
