Entanglement is at the\nheart of quantum physics, both for its conceptual foundations and for\napplications in information processing and quantum communication. Remarkably,\nentanglement can be \"swapped\": if one prepares two independent entangled pairs\nA1-A2 and B1-B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a \"Bell-State\nMeasurement\", BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangled\nstate, although these two particles have never interacted or shared any common\npast[1,2]. Experiments using twin photons produced by spontaneous parametric\ndown-conversion (SPDC) have already demonstrated entanglement swapping[3-6],\nbut here we present its first realization using continuous wave (CW) sources,\nas originally proposed[2]. The challenge was to achieve sufficiently sharp\nsynchronization of the photons in the BSM. Using narrow-band filters, the\ncoherence time of the photons that undergo the BSM is significantly increased,\nexceeding the temporal resolution of the detectors. Hence pulsed sources can be\nreplaced by CW sources, which do not require any synchronization[6,7], allowing\nfor the first time the use of completely autonomous sources. Our experiment\nexploits recent progress in the time precision of photon detectors, in the\nefficiency of photon pair production by SPDC with waveguides in nonlinear\ncrystals[8], and in the stability of narrow-band filters. This approach is\nindependent of the form of entanglement; we employed time-bin entangled\nphotons[9] at telecom wavelengths.

High critical density lines trace regions with similar\nphysical properties across galaxy types, and this produces a linear correlation\nbetween line luminosity and star formation rate. Low critical density lines\nprobe regions whose properties vary across galaxies, leading to a star\nformation rate that varies superlinearly with line luminosity.

For the case of quantum fluctuations arising when a\nquantum system interacts with a quantum environment in an overall pure state,\nthe corresponding hierarchy is defined as the environmental trace of products\nof system matrix elements of the full density matrix.

The honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays\nproduce considerably more pronounced commensuration peaks in the critical\ndepinning force than triangular pinning arrays, and also cause additional peaks\nat noninteger matching fields where a portion of the vortices are located in\nthe large interstitial regions of the pinning lattices. For the honeycomb\npinning array, we find matching effects of equal strength at most fillings\nB/B_\\phi=n/2 for n>2, where n is an integer, in agreement with recent\nexperiments. For kagome pinning arrays, pronounced matching effects generally\noccur at B/B_\\phi=n/3 for n>3, while for triangular pinning arrays pronounced\nmatching effects are observed only at integer fillings B/B_\\phi=n. At the\nnoninteger matching field peaks in the honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays, the\ninterstitial vortices are arranged in dimer, trimer, and higher order n-mer\nstates that have an overall orientational order. We call these n-mer states\n\"vortex molecular crystals\" and \"vortex plastic crystals\" since they are\nsimilar to the states recently observed in colloidal molecular crystal systems.\nWe argue that the vortex molecular crystals have properties in common with\ncertain spin systems such as Ising and n-state Potts models.

Here we show that these stars most likely lost their\nenvelopes because of binary interactions, similar to the hot subdwarf\npopulation in our own Galaxy. We have developed an evolutionary population\nsynthesis model for the far-UV excess of elliptical galaxies based on the\nbinary model developed by Han et al (2002, 2003) for the formation of hot\nsubdwarfs in our Galaxy. Despite its simplicity, it successfully reproduces\nmost of the properties of elliptical galaxies with a UV excess: the range of\nobserved UV excesses, both in $(1550-V)$ and $(2000-V)$, and their evolution\nwith redshift. We also present colour-colour diagrams for use as diagnostic\ntools in the study of elliptical galaxies. The model has major implications for\nunderstanding the evolution of the UV excess and of elliptical galaxies in\ngeneral. In particular, it implies that the UV excess is not a sign of age, as\nhad been postulated previously, and predicts that it should not be strongly\ndependent on the metallicity of the population, but exists universally from\ndwarf ellipticals to giant ellipticals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2007 13:55:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2007 03:12:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2007 11:49:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Due to the asymmetric topology, the synchronous patterns formed\nin complex networks are irregular and nonstationary. For coupling strength\nimmediately out of the synchronizable region, the typical phenomenon is the\non-off intermittency of the system dynamics. The patterns appeared in this\nprocess are signatured by the coexistence of a giant cluster, which comprises\nmost of the nodes, and a few number of small clusters. The pattern evolution is\ncharacterized by the giant cluster irregularly absorbs or emits the small\nclusters. As the coupling strength leaves away from the synchronization\nbifurcation point, the giant cluster is gradually dissolved into a number of\nsmall clusters, and the system dynamics is characterized by the integration and\nseparation of the small clusters. Dynamical mechanisms and statistical\nproperties of the nonstationary pattern evolution are analyzed and conducted,\nand some scalings are newly revealed. Remarkably, it is found that the few\nactive nodes, which escape from the giant cluster with a high frequency, are\nindependent of the coupling strength while are sensitive to the bifurcation\ntypes. We hope our findings about nonstationary pattern could give additional\nunderstandings to the dynamics of complex systems and have implications to some\nreal problems where systems maintain their normal functions only in the\nunsynchronizable state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2007 14:19:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We obtained VRI photometry for these\n33 objects as well as for 23 known white dwarf systems without trigonometric\nparallaxes, also primarily in the southern hemisphere. For the 56 objects, we\nconverted the photometry values to fluxes and fit them to a spectral energy\ndistribution using the spectroscopy to determine which model to use (i.e. pure\nhydrogen, pure helium, or metal-rich helium), resulting in estimates of\neffective temperature and distance. Eight of the new and 12 known systems are\nestimated to be within the NStars and Catalogue of Nearby Stars (CNS) horizons\nof 25 pc, constituting a potential 18% increase in the nearby white dwarf\nsample. Trigonometric parallax determinations are underway via CTIOPI for these\n20 systems.\n  One of the DCs is cool so that it displays absorption in the near infrared.\nUsing the distance determined via trigonometric parallax, we are able to\nconstrain the model-dependent physical parameters and find that this object is\nmost likely a mixed H/He atmosphere white dwarf similar to other cool white\ndwarfs identified in recent years with significant absorption in the infrared\ndue to collision-induced absorptions by molecular hydrogen.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2007 15:08:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

In the random anisotropy magnets the structural\ndisorder is present in a form of local quenched anisotropy axes of random\norientation. When the anisotropy axes are randomly distributed along the edges\nof the n-dimensional hypercube, asymptotical dynamical critical properties\ncoincide with those of the random-site Ising model. However structural disorder\ngives rise to considerable effects for non-asymptotic critical dynamics. We\ninvestigate this phenomenon by a field-theoretical renormalization group\nanalysis in the two-loop order.
