For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin\na=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits\nwhose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respect\nto the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.\nThis behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite\nto the \"normal\" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted\npreviously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to\nthe black hole, they were named \"nearly horizon-skimming orbits\". Our analysis\ngeneralizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)\nfamily of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits\nreported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming\norbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial\nconfiguration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing\norbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial\nconfiguration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the\nearlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly\nhorizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes\nbased on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to\nequatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for\neccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclination\nchange is, in any case, very small. As such, we conclude that these orbits are\nnot likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveforms\nexpected to be measured by the space-based detector LISA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2007 08:16:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2007 07:32:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Various\nmechanisms, such as the hyperfine interaction with the surrounding nuclei, the\nDresselhaus spin-orbit coupling together with the electron--bulk-phonon\ninteraction, the $g$-factor fluctuations, the direct spin-phonon coupling due\nto the phonon-induced strain, and the coaction of the\nelectron--bulk/surface-phonon interaction together with the hyperfine\ninteraction are included. The relative contributions from these spin\ndecoherence mechanisms are compared in detail. In our calculation, the\nspin-orbit coupling is included in each mechanism and is shown to have marked\neffect in most cases. The equation-of-motion approach is applied in studying\nboth the spin relaxation time $T_1$ and the spin dephasing time $T_2$, either\nin Markovian or in non-Markovian limit. When many levels are involved at finite\ntemperature, we demonstrate how to obtain the spin relaxation time from the\nFermi Golden rule in the limit of weak spin-orbit coupling. However, at high\ntemperature and/or for large spin-orbit coupling, one has to use the\nequation-of-motion approach when many levels are involved. Moreover, spin\ndephasing can be much more efficient than spin relaxation at high temperature,\nthough the two only differs by a factor of two at low temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2007 09:15:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 May 2007 06:59:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2007 03:17:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2007 01:21:29 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2007 22:42:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-01-20"}

We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver,\nwhich relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to the\ntransmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity of\nbeamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large system\nrefers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all go\nto infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,\ni.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. The\nperformance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalar\nquantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a random\nsubspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, and\napproximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers\n(matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples show\nthat these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-size\nsystems of interest.
