Our model accurately reproduces the observed fraction of boxy systems as\na function of luminosity and halo mass, for both central galaxies and\nsatellites. After correcting for the stellar mass dependence, the properties of\nthe last major merger of early-type galaxies are independent of their halo\nmass.

The simultaneous optical state,\nmonitored by both Swift UVOT and REM, is high, and in the VRI bands it is\ncomparable to what was recorded in early January 2005, before the outburst. In\nNovember 2005, the source subsided both in X-rays and optical to a quiescent\nstate, having decreased by factors of ~4 and ~60 with respect to the\nJanuary-February 2005 outburst, respectively.

In a MIMO-based mesh network, the links outgoing from each\nnode sharing the common communication spectrum can be modeled as a Gaussian\nvector broadcast channel. Recently, researchers showed that ``dirty paper\ncoding'' (DPC) is the optimal transmission strategy for Gaussian vector\nbroadcast channels. So far, there has been little study on how this fundamental\nresult will impact the cross-layer design for MIMO-based mesh networks. To fill\nthis gap, we consider the problem of jointly optimizing DPC power allocation in\nthe link layer at each node and multihop/multipath routing in a MIMO-based mesh\nnetworks. It turns out that this optimization problem is a very challenging\nnon-convex problem. To address this difficulty, we transform the original\nproblem to an equivalent problem by exploiting the channel duality. For the\ntransformed problem, we develop an efficient solution procedure that integrates\nLagrangian dual decomposition method, conjugate gradient projection method\nbased on matrix differential calculus, cutting-plane method, and subgradient\nmethod.

They have the potential to efficiently transport angular\nmomentum by MHD turbulence or via the magnetocentrifugal acceleration of\noutflows from the disk surface, and magnetically-driven mixing has implications\nfor disk chemistry and evolution of the grain population. However, the weak\nionisation of protoplanetary discs means that magnetic fields may not be able\nto effectively couple to the matter. I present calculations of the ionisation\nequilibrium and magnetic diffusivity as a function of height from the disk\nmidplane at radii of 1 and 5 AU. Dust grains tend to suppress magnetic coupling\nby soaking up electrons and ions from the gas phase and reducing the\nconductivity of the gas by many orders of magnitude. However, once grains have\ngrown to a few microns in size their effect starts to wane and magnetic fields\ncan begin to couple to the gas even at the disk midplane. Because ions are\ngenerally decoupled from the magnetic field by neutral collisions while\nelectrons are not, the Hall effect tends to dominate the diffusion of the\nmagnetic field when it is able to partially couple to the gas.\n  For a standard population of 0.1 micron grains the active surface layers have\na combined column of about 2 g/cm^2 at 1 AU; by the time grains have aggregated\nto 3 microns the active surface density is 80 g/cm^2.

A scenario interprets the\nankle as the transition from Galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays ({\\it\nankle-transition scenario}), while the other is that the dip caused by pair\nproduction on the cosmic microwave background radiation ({\\it proton-dip\nscenario}). In this paper, we consider whether cosmogenic neutrinos can be a\nclue to judge which scenario is favored. We calculated the fluxes of cosmogenic\nneutrinos following these scenarios with plausible physical parameter sets, and\nfound several important features as follows. First of all, the neutrino flux at\n$\\sim 10^{20}$ eV becomes much higher in the ankle-transition scenario as long\nas the maximum energy of the cosmic rays at sources is sufficiently high. On\nthe other hand, the neutrino spectrum has a characteristic peak at $\\sim\n10^{16}$ eV in the proton-dip scenario on the condition that extragalactic\nprotons significantly contribute to the observed cosmic rays down to $10^{17}$\neV. Thus, we conclude cosmogenic neutrinos should give us a clue to judge which\nscenario is favored, unless these features are masked by the neutrino\nbackground coming from possible, powerful neutrino sources such as AGNs and\nGRBs. We also found an interesting feature that the neutrino flux at $\\sim\n10^{18}$ eV depends only on the cosmological evolution of the cosmic ray\nsources. That means cosmogenic neutrinos with the energy bring us information\non the cosmological evolution of the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.\nFinally, we compare the fluxes of cosmogenic neutrinos with the expected\nsensitivity curves of several neutrino detectors, and conclude the detection of\ncosmogenic neutrinos in the near future is promising.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Apr 2007 10:48:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Jan 2009 15:10:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}
