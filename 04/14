According to the so called Mermin-Wagner\ntheorem, long wavelength fluctuations destroy the long-range order for 2D\ncrystals. Similarly, 2D membranes embedded in a 3D space have a tendency to be\ncrumpled. These dangerous fluctuations can, however, be suppressed by\nanharmonic coupling between bending and stretching modes making that a\ntwo-dimensional membrane can exist but should present strong height\nfluctuations. The discovery of graphene, the first truly 2D crystal and the\nrecent experimental observation of ripples in freely hanging graphene makes\nthese issues especially important. Beside the academic interest, understanding\nthe mechanisms of stability of graphene is crucial for understanding electronic\ntransport in this material that is attracting so much interest for its unusual\nDirac spectrum and electronic properties.

The precision\nof this technique is currently limited by interferometric measurements at the\n1.5% level. At this level, the center-to-limb darkening (CLD) and the presence\nof circumstellar envelopes (CSE) seem to be the two main sources of bias. The\nobservations we performed aim at improving our knowledge of the interferometric\nvisibility profile of Cepheids. In particular, we assess the systematic\npresence of CSE around Cepheids in order determine accurate distances with the\nIBWM free from CSE biased angular diameters. We observed a Cepheid (Y Oph) for\nwhich the pulsation is well resolved and a non-pulsating yellow supergiant\n(alpha Per) using long-baseline near-infrared interferometry. We interpreted\nthese data using a simple CSE model we previously developed. We found that our\nobservations of alpha Per do not provide evidence for a CSE. The measured CLD\nis explained by an hydrostatic photospheric model. Our observations of Y Oph,\nwhen compared to smaller baseline measurements, suggest that it is surrounded\nby a CSE with similar characteristics to CSE found previously around other\nCepheids. We have determined the distance to Y Oph to be d=491+/-18 pc.\nAdditional evidence points toward the conclusion that most Cepheids are\nsurrounded by faint CSE, detected by near infrared interferometry: after\nobserving four Cepheids, all show evidence for a CSE. Our CSE non-detection\naround a non-pulsating supergiant in the instability strip, alpha Per, provides\nconfidence in the detection technique and suggests a pulsation driven mass-loss\nmechanism for the Cepheids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2007 21:39:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

Shock loading was induced by the impact of a\nplanar projectile, accelerated by high explosive or in a gas gun. Surface\nvelocimetry showed an elastic wave at the start of release from the shocked\nstate; the amplitude of the elastic wave matched the prediction to around 10%,\nindicating that the predicted flow stress in the shocked state was reasonable.\nThe measured temperatures were consistent with the simulations, indicating that\nthe fraction of plastic work converted to heat was in the range 70-100% for\nthese loading conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Apr 2007 03:28:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
