The distillation protocol is frugal in its use of ancilla qubits,\nrequiring only a single ancilla qubit when the noise is dominated by one Pauli\nerror, and two for a general noise model. The protocol works with such scarce\nlocal resources by never post-selecting on the measurement outcomes of\npurification rounds. We find that such a strategy causes fidelity to follow a\nbiased random walk, and that a target fidelity is likely to be reached more\nrapidly than for a comparable post-selecting protocol. An analysis is presented\nof how imperfect local operations limit the attainable fidelity. For example, a\nsingle Pauli error rate of 20% can be distilled down to $\\sim 10$ times the\nimperfection in local operations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2007 17:44:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2007 10:14:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2007 12:01:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-09"}

Scattered\nlight is detected up to 14'' from the star. The observations are consistent\nwith the presence of an extended flattened nebula with the same inclination as\nthe inner disk. The well-known ``spiral arms'' are clearly observed and they\ntrail the rotating disk material. Weaker arms never before reported are also\nseen. The inter-arm space becomes brighter, but the structures become more\nneutral in color at longer wavelengths, which is not consistent with models\nthat assume that they are due to the effects of a warped disk. Along the major\ndisk axis, the colors of the scattered-light relative to the star are \\Delta\n(F435W-F606W) ~ 0.0--0.2 mags and \\Delta (F435W-F814W)~0.5--1 mags.

We argue that we are observing only the\ngeometrically thick, optically thin envelope of the disk, while the optically\nthick disk responsible for the far-IR emission is undetected.

The formalism is given in terms of Lie\ngroupoids, specifying a discrete Lagrangian and a constraint submanifold on it.\nAdditionally, it is necessary to fix a vector subbundle of the Lie algebroid\nassociated to the Lie groupoid. We also discuss the existence of nonholonomic\nevolution operators in terms of the discrete nonholonomic Legendre\ntransformations and in terms of adequate decompositions of the prolongation of\nthe Lie groupoid. The characterization of the reversibility of the evolution\noperator and the discrete nonholonomic momentum equation are also considered.\nFinally, we illustrate with several classical examples the wide range of\napplication of the theory (the discrete nonholonomic constrained particle, the\nSuslov system, the Chaplygin sleigh, the Veselova system, the rolling ball on a\nrotating table and the two wheeled planar mobile robot).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2007 08:22:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

One of the typical features shown by observations of solar\nprominence oscillations is that they are damped in time and that the values of\nthe damping times are usually between one and three times the corresponding\noscillatory period. However, the mechanism responsible for the attenuation is\nstill not well-known. Aims. Thermal conduction, optically thin or thick\nradiation and heating are taken into account in the energy equation, and their\nrole on the attenuation of prominence oscillations is evaluated. Methods. The\ndispersion relation for linear non-adiabatic magnetoacoustic waves is derived\nconsidering an equilibrium made of a prominence plasma slab embedded in an\nunbounded corona. The magnetic field is orientated along the direction parallel\nto the slab axis and has the same strength in all regions. By solving the\ndispersion relation for a fixed wavenumber, a complex oscillatory frequency is\nobtained, and the period and the damping time are computed. Results. The effect\nof conduction and radiation losses is different for each magnetoacoustic mode\nand depends on the wavenumber. In the observed range of wavelengths the\ninternal slow mode is attenuated by radiation from the prominence plasma, the\nfast mode by the combination of prominence radiation and coronal conduction and\nthe external slow mode by coronal conduction. The consideration of the external\ncorona is of paramount importance in the case of the fast and external slow\nmodes, whereas it does not affect the internal slow modes at all. Conclusions.\nNon-adiabatic effects are efficient damping mechanisms for magnetoacoustic\nmodes, and the values of the obtained damping times are compatible with those\nobserved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2007 11:53:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2007 10:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In\nthe AdS/CFT dictionary, the coefficient of this coupling is proportional to the\nbaryon number density, and is fixed uniquely in the five-dimensional\nholographic dual by anomalies in the flavor currents. For the lightest mesons,\nthe coupling mixes transverse $\\rho$ and $a_1$ polarization states. At\nsufficiently large baryon number densities, it produces an instability, which\ncauses the $\\rho$ and $a_1$ mesons to condense in a state breaking both\nrotational and translational invariance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2007 15:55:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
