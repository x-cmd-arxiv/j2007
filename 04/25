Overall, both the NFPS and SDSS show a modest\nfraction of BCGs with emission lines (~15%). No trend in the fraction of\nemitting BCGs as a function of galaxy mass or cluster velocity dispersion is\nfound. However we find that, for those BCGs found in cooling flow clusters,\n71^{+9}_{-14}% have optical emission. Furthermore, if we consider only BCGs\nwithin 50kpc of the X-ray centre of a cooling flow cluster, the emission-line\nfraction rises further to 100^{+0}_{-15}%. Excluding the cooling flow clusters,\nonly ~10% of BCGs are line emitting, comparable to the control sample of\ngalaxies. We show that the physical origin of the emission line activity\nvaries: in some cases it has LINER-like line ratios, whereas in others it is a\ncomposite of star-formation and LINER-like activity.

We\nshow that for any growing cells whose gene expression is under stochastic\nfluctuations, adaptive cellular state is inevitably selected by noise, even\nwithout specific signal transduction network for it. In general, changes in\nprotein concentration in a cell are given by its synthesis minus dilution and\ndegradation, both of which are proportional to the rate of cell growth. In an\nadaptive state with a higher growth speed, both terms are large and balanced.\nUnder the presence of noise in gene expression, the adaptive state is less\naffected by stochasticity since both the synthesis and dilution terms are\nlarge, while for a non-adaptive state both the terms are smaller so that cells\nare easily kicked out of the original state by noise. Hence, escape time from a\ncellular state and the cellular growth rate are negatively correlated. This\nleads to a selection of adaptive states with higher growth rates, and model\nsimulations confirm this selection to take place in general. The results\nsuggest a general form of adaptation that has never been brought to light - a\nprocess that requires no specific machineries for sensory adaptation.

The present work is a continuation of the\nprevious work, but assumes a more realistic model of CR propagation in the\nGalaxy. The previous work assumed an unbounded three-dimensional diffusion\nregion, whereas the present one considers a flat cylindrical disc bounded in\nboth the radial and vertical directions. The study has found that the effect of\nthe vertical halo boundary $H$ on the local SNR contribution to the observed CR\nanisotropy is negligible as long as $H\\gtrsim 2kpc$. Considering the values of\nthe halo height $H\\gtrsim 2kpc$ obtained by different authors, the present work\nsuggests that the study of the effect of local sources on the CR anisotropy can\nbe carried out without having much information on $H$ and hence, using the much\nsimpler three-dimentional unbounded solution. Finally, the present work\ndiscusses about the possibility of explaining the observed anisotropy below the\nknee by a single dominant source with properly chosen source parameters, and\nclaims that the source may be an \\textit{undetected} old SNR with a\ncharacteristic age of $\\sim 1.5\\times 10^5 yr$ located at a distance of $\\sim\n0.57 kpc$ from the Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2007 10:02:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2007 06:55:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We examine the spatial distribution of turn-off stars and\ndemonstrate that all belong to NGC 1846 rather than to any field star\npopulation. In addition, the spatial distributions of the two sets of turn-off\nstars may exhibit different central concentrations and some asymmetries. By\nfitting isochrones, we show that the properties of the colour-magnitude diagram\ncan be explained if there are two stellar populations of equivalent metal\nabundance in NGC 1846, differing in age by approximately 300 Myr. The absolute\nages of the two populations are ~1.9 and ~2.2 Gyr, although there may be a\nsystematic error of up to +/-0.4 Gyr in these values. The metal abundance\ninferred from isochrone fitting is [M/H] ~ -0.40, consistent with spectroscopic\nmeasurements of [Fe/H]. We propose that the observed properties of NGC 1846 can\nbe explained if this object originated via the tidal capture of two star\nclusters formed separately in a star cluster group in a single giant molecular\ncloud.
