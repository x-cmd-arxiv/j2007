The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted\ninto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC\nCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and\nvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of\nthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically\nreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above the\nion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic\nfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional\nand collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,\nwhich obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated\nwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion and\nelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave\n(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive\nphase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the\nenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless\nwave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the\nphase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the\nelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling\nrelations are derived for these cascades.

We prove a\nresult that takes advantage of differences in rates of expansion in the terms\nof a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence to create unique lifts of finite\ndimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariant\nsubspaces of the preceding term. This allows us to take invariant cohomological\nclasses and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a given\ntype, including unique measures of a given type, that represent those classes\nand are invariant under pullback. A dynamically interesting self map may have a\nplethora of invariant measures, so the uniquess of the constructed currents is\nimportant. It means that if local growth is not too big compared to the growth\nrate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class gives\nsufficient \"marching orders\" to the system to prohibit the formation of any\nother such invariant current of the same type (say from some local dynamical\nsubsystem). Because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we give\nconditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheaf\ncontaining it. Using a smoothing argument this allows us to show that the sheaf\ncohomology of the currents under consideration can be canonically identified\nwith the deRham cohomology groups.

We argue\nthat this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function that\ninitially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporation\ndriven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between the\nobserved GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, central\nconcentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model in\nwhich the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by\n-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-known\ninsensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal\n``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significant\nvariation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-driven\ncluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.\nOur conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to depend\ninstead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal\nradii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternative\nprescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties\n(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable as\nrho_h.

We consider\nlarge-scale hydrodynamic motions where the viscosity and heat conduction can be\nneglected, and one arrives at the equations of ideal gas dynamics with an\nadditional term describing bulk energy losses due to inelastic collisions. We\nemploy Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationary\nanalytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. These\nsolutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up in\na finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. The density blowups\nsignal formation of close-packed clusters of particles. As the density blow-up\ntime $t_c$ is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law $\\sim\n(t_c-t)^{-2}$. The velocity gradient blows up as $\\sim - (t_c-t)^{-1}$ while\nthe velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp (rather than a shock\ndiscontinuity) at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at the\nsingularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gas\npressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in time\nclose to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the density\nblowup, of the same type, may coexist with an \"ordinary\" shock, at which the\nhydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite. We confirm stability of the\nexact solutions with respect to small one-dimensional perturbations by solving\nthe ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically. Furthermore, numerical solutions\nshow that the local features of the density blowup hold universally,\nindependently of details of the initial and boundary conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Apr 2007 12:54:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 May 2007 07:00:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

According to this property the\nspace-time lagrangian density evaluated on a restricted set of field\nconfigurations, called universal sector, turns out to be same around all the\npp-waves, even off-shell, with same transverse space and same profiles for the\nbackground scalars. In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial\nfields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell\npp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal\nsector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to\nthe pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results\ncan also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also\nstudy such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In\nparticular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse\nspace and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition\nrelating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive\nmodes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this\nsimplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on\nthe two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an\niterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT\nequations of motion has been discussed. All our bosonic string theory analyses\ncan be generalised to the common Neveu-Schwarz sector of superstrings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Apr 2007 12:55:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2007 12:06:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

A physical\nlaw, which relates measured variables, is optimally extracted from experimental\ndata by the conditional average estimator. It is derived directly from the\nkernel estimator and corresponds to a general nonparametric regression. The\nproposed method is demonstrated by the modeling of a return map of noisy\nchaotic data. In this example, the nonparametric regression is used to predict\na future value of chaotic time series from the present one.
