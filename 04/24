When Fourier transformed, these out of phase\noscillations induce percent-level shifts in the acoustic peak of the two-point\ncorrelation function.

The width process of a splitting tree is then a binary, homogeneous\nCrump--Mode--Jagers (CMJ) process, and is not Markovian unless the lifetime\ndistribution is exponential. Here, we allow the birth rate to be infinite, that\nis, pairs of birth times and lifespans of newborns form a Poisson point process\nalong the lifetime of their mother, with possibly infinite intensity measure. A\nsplitting tree is a random (so-called) chronological tree. Each element of a\nchronological tree is a (so-called) existence point $(v,\\tau)$ of some\nindividual $v$ (vertex) in a discrete tree, where $\\tau$ is a nonnegative real\nnumber called chronological level (time). We introduce a total order on\nexistence points, called linear order, and a mapping $\\varphi$ from the tree\ninto the real line which preserves this order.

We\ncompare three outflow models: No outflows, a \"constant wind\" (cw) model that\nemulates the popular Dekel & Silk (1986) scenario, and a ``momentum-driven\nwind\" (vzw) model. We find that only the vzw scaling reproduces the observed\nz~2 MZR's slope, amplitude, and scatter. Comparing our fully three-dimensional\nsimulations with a simple one-zone chemical evolution model, we find that the\nMZR can be understood in terms of three parameters: (1) The equilibrium\nmetallicity Z_eq=y*SFR/ACC (where y=true yield), reflecting the enrichment\nbalance between star formation rate SFR and gas accretion rate ACC; (2) the\ndilution time t_d=M_g/ACC, representing the timescale for a galaxy to return to\nZ_eq after a metallicity-perturbing interaction; and (3) the blowout mass\nM_blowout, which is the galaxy stellar mass above which winds can escape its\nhalo. When outflows with mass loading factor MLF are present, galaxies below\nM_blowout obey Z_eq = y/(1+MLF), while above M_blowout, Z_eq->y. Our cw model\nhas M_blowout ~ 10^10 M_sun, which yields a sharp upturn in the MZR above this\nscale and a flat MZR with large scatter below it, in strong disagreement with\nobservations.

We probe the effect of turbulent diffusion on the chemistry at the\ninterface between a cold neutral medium (CNM) cloudlet and the warm neutral\nmedium (WNM). Methods. We perform moving grid, multifluid, 1D, hydrodynamical\nsimulations with chemistry including thermal and chemical diffusion. The\ndiffusion coefficients are enhanced to account for turbulent diffusion. We\npost-process the steady-states of our simulations with a crude model of\nradiative transfer to compute line profiles. Results. Turbulent diffusion\nspreads out the transition region between the CNM and the WNM. We find that the\nCNM slightly expands and heats up: its CH and H$_2$ content decreases due to\nthe lower density. The change of physical conditions and diffusive transport\nincrease the H$^+$ content in the CNM which results in increased OH and H$_2$O.\nDiffusion transports some CO out of the CNM. It also brings H$_2$ into contact\nwith the warm gas with enhanced production of CH$^+$, H$_3^+$, OH and H$_2$O at\nthe interface. O lines are sensitive to the spread of the thermal profile in\nthe intermediate region between the CNM and the WNM. Enhanced molecular content\nat the interface of the cloud broadens the molecular line profiles and helps\nexciting transitions of intermediate energy. The relative molecular yield are\nfound higher for bigger clouds. Conclusions. Turbulent diffusion can be the\nsource of additional molecular production and should be included in chemical\nmodels of the interstellar medium (ISM). It also is a good candidate for the\ninterpretation of observational problems such as warm H$_2$, CH$^+$ formation\nand presence of H$_3^+$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2007 09:53:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The present state of knowledge about stellar winds, based on\npapers presented at this workshop, is described. About ten years ago the\nmechanisms of the winds were reasonably well understood, the mass loss rates\nwere known, and the predictions of stellar evolution theory with mass loss\nagreed with observations. However, recent studies especially those based on\nFUSE observations, have resulted in a significant reduction of the mass loss\nrates, that disagrees with predictions from radiation driven wind models. The\nsituation is discussed and future studies that can clarify the situation are\nsuggested.\n  I also discuss what is known about the dissolution of star clusters in\ndifferent environments. The dissolution time can be derived from the mass and\nage distributions of cluster samples. The resulting dissolution times of\nclusters in the solar neighborhood (SN) and in interacting galaxies are shorter\nthan predicted by two-body relaxation of clusters in a tidal field. Encounters\nwith giant molecular clouds can explain the fate of clusters in the SN and are\nthe most likely cause of the short lifetime of clusters in interacting\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2007 10:57:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Polchinski concerning the\nperturbative renormalization with flow equations. In the first part of this\nwork, the program of renormalization with flow equations is reviewed and then\nextended to effective field theories that have a finite UV cutoff. This is done\nfor a scalar field theory by imposing additional renormalization conditions for\nsome of the nonrenormalizable couplings. It turns out that one so obtains a\nstatement on the predictivity of the effective theory at scales far below the\nUV cutoff. In particular, nonrenormalizable theories can be treated without\nproblems in the proposed framework. In the second part, the standard covariant\nBRS quantization program for Euclidean Einstein gravity is applied. A momentum\ncutoff regularization is imposed and the resulting violation of the\nSlavnov-Taylor identities is discussed. Deriving Polchinski's renormalization\ngroup equation for Euclidean quantum gravity, the predictivity of effective\nquantum gravity at scales far below the Planck scale is investigated with flow\nequations. A fine-tuning procedure for restoring the violated Slavnov-Taylor\nidentities is proposed and it is argued that in the effective quantum gravity\ncontext, the restoration will only be accomplished with finite accuracy.\nFinally, the no-cutoff limit of Euclidean quantum gravity is analyzed from the\nviewpoint of the Polchinski method. It is speculated whether a limit with\nnonvanishing gravitational constant might exist where the latter would\nultimatively be determined by the cosmological constant and the masses of the\nelementary particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2007 14:49:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
