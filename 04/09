Therefore, many more redshifts than blueshifts should be\nobserved for galaxies and supernovae, etc in the sky. This conclusion agrees\nwith current observations. The estimated value of the redshift constant beta of\nthe dark matter field fluid is in the range of 10^(-3) ~ 10^(-5)/Mpc. A large\nredshift value from a distant celestial object may not necessarily indicate\nthat it has a large receding speed. Based on the redshift effect of dark matter\nfield fluid, it is concluded that at least in time average all photons have the\nsame geometry (size and shape) in all inertial reference frames and do not have\nlength contraction effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2007 12:18:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A known approach of splitting the saddle point problem into\nseparate equations for the primary unknown and for the Lagrange multiplier is\nused. We revisit the traditional Ladygenskaya--Babu\\v{s}ka--Brezzi (LBB) or\ninf--sup condition as well as the standard coercivity condition, and analyze\nhow they are affected by the degeneracy of the corresponding bilinear forms. We\nsuggest and discuss generalized conditions that cover the degenerate case.

The\ngeneralized coercivity condition is necessary and sufficient for wellposedness\nof the problem with respect to the primary unknown under some other\nassumptions. We connect the generalized coercivity condition to the\npositiveness of the minimum gap of relevant subspaces, and propose several\nequivalent expressions for the minimum gap.

In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie.

The best known example of such an addition theorem is\nthe Laplace expansion of the Coulomb potential which possesses a characteristic\ntwo-range form. Guseinov [Chem. Phys. {\\bf 309}, 209 - 213 (2005)] derived\none-range addition theorems for the Coulomb potential via the limit $\\beta \\to\n0$ in previously derived one-range addition theorems for the Yukawa potential\n$\\exp \\bigl(-\\beta | \\bm{r}-\\bm{r}'| \\bigr) /| \\bm{r}-\\bm{r}'|$. At first\nsight, this looks like a remarkable achievement, but from a mathematical point\nof view, Guseinov's work is at best questionable and in some cases\nfundamentally flawed. One-range addition theorems are expansions in terms of\nfunctions that are complete and orthonormal in a given Hilbert space, but\nGuseinov replaced the complete and orthonormal functions by nonorthogonal\nSlater-type functions and rearranged the resulting expansions. This is a\ndangerous operation whose validity must be checked. It is shown that the\none-center limit $\\bm{r}' = \\bm{0}$ of Guseinov's rearranged Yukawa addition\ntheorems as well as of several other addition theorems does not exist.\nMoreover, the Coulomb potential does not belong to any of the Hilbert spaces\nimplicitly used by Guseinov. Accordingly, one-range addition theorems for the\nCoulomb potential diverge in the mean. Instead, these one-range addition\ntheorems have to interpreted as expansions of generalized functions in the\nsense of Schwartz that converge weakly in suitable functionals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2007 09:44:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Jun 2007 12:59:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 31 Dec 2007 11:47:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-12-31"}

The spectra of\nthese sources were fitted using two spectral models (an absorbed power-law and\na disk blackbody) to ascertain the dependence of estimated parameters on the\nspectral model used. It was found that the cumulative luminosity function\ndepends on the choice of the spectral model, especially for luminosities $>\n10^{40}$ ergs/s. In accordance with previous results, a large number ($\\sim\n80$) of the sources have luminosities $> 10^{39}$ ergs/s (Ultra-Luminous X-ray\nsources) with indistinguishable average spectral parameters (inner disk\ntemperature $\\sim 1$ keV and/or photon index $\\Gamma \\sim 2$) with those of the\nlower luminosities ones. After considering foreground stars and known\nbackground AGN,we identify four sources whose minimum luminosity exceed\n$10^{40}$ ergs/s, and call them Extremely Luminous X-ray sources (ELX). The\nspectra of these sources are in general better represented by the disk black\nbody model than the power-law one. These ELX can be grouped into two distinct\nspectral classes. Two of them have an inner disk temperature of $< 0.5$ keV and\nhence are called ``supersoft'' ELX, while the other two have temperatures\n$\\gtrsim 1.3$ keV and are called ``hard'' ELX. The estimated inner disk\ntemperatures of the supersoft ELX are compatible with the hypothesis that they\nharbor intermediate size black holes, which are accreting at $\\sim 0.5$ times\ntheir Eddington Luminosity. The radiative mechanism for hard ELX, seems to be\nInverse Comptonization, which in contrast to standard black holes systems, is\nprobably saturated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2007 14:03:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

Results for stars in the LH9 and\nLH10 associations of N11 are consistent with a sequential star formation\nscenario, in which activity in LH9 triggered the formation of LH10. Our sample\ncontains four stars of spectral type O2, of which the hottest is found to be\n~49-54 kK (cf. ~45-46 kK for O3 stars). The masses of helium-enriched dwarfs\nand giants are systematically lower than those implied by non-rotating\nevolutionary tracks.

This result is consistent with findings\nfor SMC stars by Mokiem et al. For bright giants and supergiants no such\nmass-discrepancy is found, implying that these stars follow tracks of modestly\n(or non-)rotating objects. Stellar mass-loss properties were found to be\nintermediate to those found in massive stars in the Galaxy and the SMC, and\ncomparisons with theoretical predictions at LMC metallicity yielded good\nagreement over the luminosity range of our targets, i.e. 5.0 < log L/L(sun) <\n6.1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2007 15:48:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
