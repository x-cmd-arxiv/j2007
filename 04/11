Afterward, the\nspace of solutions condenses over a finite number of the largest states and\nconsequently the total entropy of solutions becomes smaller than the annealed\none.

For a fixed ratio of the axial rotation\nrate to the surface equatorial rotation rate, increasingly rapid rotation\ngenerally deepens convective envelopes, shrinks convective cores, and can lead\nto the presence of a convective core (envelope) in a 1 M_sun (2 M_sun) model, a\nfeature that is absent in a nonrotating star of the same mass.

We study the resulting differentially\nrotating profile, focusing on the impact this has for type I X-ray bursts. The\npredominant viscosity is likely provided by the Tayler-Spruit dynamo. The\nradial and azimuthal magnetic field components have strengths of ~10^5 G and\n~10^10 G, respectively. This leads to nearly uniform rotation at the depths of\ninterest for X-ray bursts. A remaining small shear transmits the accreted\nangular momentum inward to the NS interior. Though this shear gives little\nviscous heating, it can trigger turbulent mixing. Detailed simulations will be\nrequired to fully understand the consequences of mixing, but our models\nillustrate some general features. Mixing has the greatest impact when the\nbuoyancy at the compositional discontinuity between accreted matter and ashes\nis overcome. This occurs at high accretion rates, at low spin frequencies, or\nmay depend on the ashes from the previous burst. We then find two new regimes\nof burning. The first is ignition in a layer containing a mixture of heavier\nelements from the ashes. If ignition occurs at the base of the mixed layer,\nrecurrence times as short as ~5-30 minutes are possible. This may explain the\nshort recurrence time of some bursts, but incomplete burning is still needed to\nexplain these bursts' energetics. When mixing is sufficiently strong, a second\nregime is found where accreted helium mixes deep enough to burn stably,\nquenching X-ray bursts. We speculate that the observed change in X-ray burst\nproperties near one-tenth the Eddington accretion rate is from this mechanism.\nThe carbon-rich material produced by stable helium burning would be important\nfor triggering and fueling superbursts.

Previous\nsubmm imaging resolved this region into a cluster of 5 dust cores, one of which\nis associated with the UCHII region G23.96+0.15, and another with an H2O maser.\nIn our new 2.7 mm continuum image, only the UCHII region is detected, with\ntotal flux and morphology in good agreement with the free-free emission in VLA\ncm-wave maps. For the other four objects, the nondetections at 2.7 mm and in\nthe MSX mid-IR bands are consistent with cool dust emission with a temperature\nof 13-40K and luminosity of 1000-40000 Lsun. By combining single-dish and\ninterferometric data, we have identified over two dozen virialized C18O cores\nin this region that contain ~40% of the total molecular gas mass present.

Assuming that dark matter is composed primarily of weakly\ninteracting massive particles (WIMPs), a star orbiting close enough to the SMBH\ncan capture WIMPs at an extremely high rate. The stellar luminosity due to\nannihilation of captured WIMPs in the stellar core may be comparable to or even\nexceed the luminosity of the star due to thermonuclear burning.

While our sample is\ndefinitively not representative of the total open cluster sample in the Galaxy,\nit does cover a wide range of cluster parameters and is uniform enough to allow\nfor simple statistical considerations. BV wide-field CCD photometry was\nobtained for open clusters for which photometric, structural, and dynamical\nevolution parameters were determined. The limiting and core radii were\ndetermined by analyzing radial density profiles. The ages, reddenings, and\ndistances were obtained from the solar metallicity isochrone fitting. The mass\nfunction was used to study the dynamical state of the systems, mass segregation\neffect and to estimate the total mass and number of cluster members. This study\nreports on the first determination of basic parameters for 11 out of 42\nobserved open clusters. The angular sizes for the majority of the observed\nclusters appear to be several times larger than the catalogue data indicate.\nThe core and limiting cluster radii are correlated and the latter parameter is\n3.2 times larger on average. The limiting radius increases with the cluster's\nmass, and both the limiting and core radii decrease in the course of dynamical\nevolution. For dynamically not advanced clusters, the mass function slope is\nsimilar to the universal IMF slope. For more evolved systems, the effect of\nevaporation of low-mass members is clearly visible. The initial mass\nsegregation is present in all the observed young clusters, whereas the\ndynamical mass segregation appears in clusters older than about log(age)=8.\nLow-mass stars are deficient in the cores of clusters older than log(age)=8.5\nand not younger than one relaxation time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2007 07:52:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Assuming\nthat their blue plume populations are made of BSS, we estimate the BSS\nfrequency for 8 Local Group non star-forming dwarf galaxies, using a\ncompilation of ground and space based photometry.\n  Our results can be summarized as follows: (i) The BSS frequency in dwarf\ngalaxies, at any given Mv, is always higher than that in globular clusters of\nsimilar luminosities; (ii) the BSS frequency for the lowest luminosity dwarf\ngalaxies is in excellent agreement with that observed in the Milky Way halo;\nand most interestingly (iii) derive a statistically significant\nanti-correlation between the BSS frequency and the galaxy Mv.\n  The low density, almost collision-less, environments of our dwarf galaxy\nsample allow us to infer (i) their very low dynamical evolution; (ii) a\nnegligible production of collisional BSS; and consequently (iii) that their\nblue plumes are mainly made of primordial binaries.
