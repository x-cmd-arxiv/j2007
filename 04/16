Under this circumstance, the MBH-Mgal relation\nis a passive attractor that eventually converges to a tight linear relation\nbecause of two basic statistical effects: a central limit-like tendency for\ngalaxy mergers which is much stronger for major mergers than minor mergers, and\na convergence toward a linear relation that is due mainly to minor mergers. A\ncurious consequence of this thought experiment is that, if galaxy bulges are\nformed by major mergers, then merging statistics naturally show that MBH would\ncorrelate more strongly with bulge dominated galaxies, because of stronger\ncentral-seeking tendencies, than with disk dominated galaxies. Even if some\nother physics is ultimately responsible for causing a linear MBH-Mbulge\nrelationship, this thought experiment shows that, counter to intuition, random\nmerging of galaxies that harbor random BH masses tends to strengthen rather\nthan weaken a pre-existing, linear, correlation.

This allows sufficient separation of scales to\nobserve a Navier-Stokes (NS) inertial range followed by a 2nd LANS inertial\nrange. The analysis of the third-order structure function scaling supports the\npredicted l^3 scaling; it corresponds to a k^(-1) scaling of the energy\nspectrum. The energy spectrum itself shows a different scaling which goes as\nk^1. This latter spectrum is consistent with the absence of stretching in the\nsub-filter scales due to the Taylor frozen-in hypothesis employed as a closure\nin the derivation of LANS. These two scalings are conjectured to coexist in\ndifferent spatial portions of the flow. The l^3 (E(k) k^(-1)) scaling is\nsubdominant to k^1 in the energy spectrum, but the l^3 scaling is responsible\nfor the direct energy cascade, as no cascade can result from motions with no\ninternal degrees of freedom. We verify the prediction for the size of the LANS\nattractor resulting from this scaling.

The fully\nconverged grid-independent LANS may not be the best approximation to a direct\nnumerical simulation of the NS equations since the minimum error is a balance\nbetween truncation errors and the approximation error due to using LANS instead\nof the primitive equations. Furthermore, the small-scale behavior of LANS\ncontributes to a reduction of flux at constant energy, leading to a shallower\nenergy spectrum for large alpha.

Solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation within the rime\nAnsatz which are maximally different from the standard one we call \"strict\nrime\". A strict rime non-unitary solution is parameterized by a projective\nvector. We show that this solution transforms to the Cremmer-Gervais R-matrix\nby a change of basis with a matrix containing symmetric functions in the\ncomponents of the parameterizing vector. A strict unitary solution (the rime\nAnsatz is well adapted for taking a unitary limit) is shown to be equivalent to\na quantization of a classical \"boundary\" r-matrix of Gerstenhaber and\nGiaquinto.

Many new geometric objects, which have no counterpart in\nthe classical AP-geometry, emerge in this more general context. We refer to\nsuch a geometry as generalized AP-geometry (GAP-geometry). In analogy to\nAP-geometry, we define a $d$-connection in $\\pi^{-1}(TM)$ having remarkable\nproperties, which we call the canonical $d$-connection, in terms of the unique\ntorsion-free Riemannian $d$-connection. In addition to these two\n$d$-connections, two more $d$-connections are defined, the dual and the\nsymmetric $d$-connections. Our space, therefore, admits twelve curvature\ntensors (corresponding to the four defined $d$-connections), three of which\nvanish identically. Simple formulae for the nine non-vanishing curvatures\ntensors are obtained, in terms of the torsion tensors of the canonical\n$d$-connection.
