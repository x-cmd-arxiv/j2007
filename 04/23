Focusing on this quarrel allows us\nto explore the algebraic identity of the polynomial practices of the\nmanipulations of forms in use before the advent of structural approaches to\nlinear algebra. The latter approaches identified these practices with methods\nfor the classification of similar matrices. We show that the prac- tices --\nJordan's canonical reduction and Kronecker's invariant computation -- reflect\nidentities inseparable from the social context of the time. Moreover, these\npractices reveal not only tacit knowledge, local ways of thinking, but also --\nin light of a long history tracing back to the work of Lagrange, Laplace, Cau-\nchy, and Hermite -- two internal philosophies regarding the significance of\ngenerality which are inseparable from two disciplinary ideals opposing algebra\nand arithmetic.

However, the derived parameters are often extreme, both in\nterms of the underlying spacetime and the reflection geometry, and these models\nrequire that the disc is far from hydrostatic equilibrium. An alternative model\nuses similarly partially ionised, velocity smeared material but seen in\nabsorption, though again the derived velocities are extreme, requiring magnetic\ndriving (in the jet?) rather than a simple line driven disc wind. We find that\nwhile both models give comparably good fits to XMM--Newton data, we favour the\nabsorption model as, unlike reflection, all the derived spectral indices are\nsoft.

Moreover a very simple bound for such a\nsufficient order is given in term of the rank and of two very simple invariants\n: the regularity order which count the number of times you need to apply \\\n$b^{-1}.a \\simeq \\partial_z.z$ in order to reach a simple pole (a,b)-module.\nThe second invariant is the ''width'' which corresponds, in the simple pole\ncase, to the maximal integral difference between to eigenvalues of $b^{-1}.a$\n  (the logarithm of the monodromy). In the computation of examples this theorem\nis quite helpfull because it tells you at which power of $b$ in the expansions\nyou may stop without loosing any information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Apr 2007 13:00:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2007 14:35:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-09-05"}

It is shown that, if the zero point energies for\nthe cosmic microwave background and for all the rest of the universe that is\nnot cosmic microwave background are introduced into this model as two entities,\ntheir separate values appear within this theory in the form of a numerical\ndifference. It is this difference that gives the numerical value for the zero\npoint value of Einstein's dark energy density. Consequently, although the two\nzero point energies may be large, their difference can give the known small\ndark energy value from cosmology for dark energy density. Issues relating to\ninterpretation, calculation and measurement associated with this result and an\ninterpretation of dark energy as a measure of polarisation of the vacuum are\ndiscussed.

Remarkably, the model possesses an exact solution\nwhen tuned to a special manifold in its parameter space known as the Toulouse\nlimit. We use the Toulouse limit to exactly calculate the adiabatically pumped\nspin current in the Kondo regime. In the absence of both potential scattering\nand a voltage bias, the instantaneous charge current is strictly zero for a\ngeneric Kondo model. However, a nonzero spin current can be pumped through the\nsystem in the presence of a finite magnetic field, provided the spin couples\nasymmetrically to the two leads. Tunneling through a Kondo impurity thus offers\na natural mechanism for generating a pure spin current. We show, in particular,\nthat one can devise pumping cycles along which the average spin pumped per\ncycle is closely equal to $\\hbar$. By analogy with Brouwer's formula for\nnoninteracting systems with two driven parameters, the pumped spin current is\nexpressed as a geometrical property of a scattering matrix. However, the\nrelevant %Alex: I replaced topological with geometrical in the sentence above\nscattering matrix that enters the formulation pertains to the Majorana fermions\nthat appear at the Toulouse limit rather than the physical electrons that carry\nthe current.
