In this\narticle, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing that\nthese relaxed decision problems belong to P. This is based on the reduction of\nthe preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematical\npositivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positive\nformulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structural\nconstants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. These\nturn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of the\nKazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the\ncanonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum\ngroups. The known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the Riemann\nhypothesis over finite fields and the related results.

X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like subcluster\nwith a prominent bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions of\nthe total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the collisionless\ngalaxies (and inconsistent with the X-ray brightness peaks). Previous studies,\nbased on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on the\nself-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma/m, using\nsimplified analytic techniques. In this work, we take advantage of new,\nhigher-quality observational datasets by running N-body simulations of\n1E0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, and\ncomparing the results with observations. Furthermore, the recent data allow for\na new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on the non-observation\nof an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. This\nnew method places an upper limit (68% confidence) of sigma/m < 1.25 cm^2/g. If\nwe make the assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equal\nmass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most stringent\nconstraint of sigma/m < 0.7 cm^2/g, which comes from the consistency of the\nsubcluster's observed mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster's, and with the\nuniversal cluster value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of dark\nmatter particles being scattered away due to collisions.

Aims: This motivates planet searches around\nstars which are significantly more massive or less massive than the Sun, and in\nparticular our radial velocity search for planets around very-low mass stars.\nMethods: As part of that program, we obtained measurements of GJ 674, an M2.5\ndwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a dispersion much in excess of their internal\nerrors. An intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersion\nis due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days.\nResults: These data are well described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where each\nplanet has a ~11 Mearth minimum mass. A careful analysis of the (low level)\nmagnetic activity of GJ 674 however demonstrates that the 35-day period\ncoincides with the stellar rotation period. This signal therefore originates in\na spot inhomogeneity modulated by stellar rotation. The 4.69-day signal on the\nother hand is caused by a bona-fide planet, GJ 674b.

The dynamical evolution of a 0.9 Msun + 0.6 Msun CO white\ndwarf merger is followed by a three-dimensional SPH simulation. We use an\nelaborate prescription in which artificial viscosity is essentially absent,\nunless a shock is detected, and a much larger number of SPH particles than\nearlier calculations. Based on this simulation, we suggest that the central\nregion of the merger remnant can, once it has reached quasi-static equilibrium,\nbe approximated as a differentially rotating CO star, which consists of a\nslowly rotating cold core and a rapidly rotating hot envelope surrounded by a\ncentrifugally supported disc. We construct a model of the CO remnant that\nmimics the results of the SPH simulation using a one-dimensional hydrodynamic\nstellar evolution code and then follow its secular evolution. The stellar\nevolution models indicate that the growth of the cold core is controlled by\nneutrino cooling at the interface between the core and the hot envelope, and\nthat carbon ignition in the envelope can be avoided despite high effective\naccretion rates. This result suggests that the assumption of forced accretion\nof cold matter that was adopted in previous studies of the evolution of double\nCO white dwarf merger remnants may not be appropriate. Our results imply that\nat least some products of double CO white dwarfs merger may be considered good\ncandidates for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. In this case, the\ncharacteristic time delay between the initial dynamical merger and the eventual\nexplosion would be ~10^5 yr.

We believe this\nmodel is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend on\nthe details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution of\na system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processes\nthrough two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of population\nstructure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: the\neffective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of local\ndynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of a\ncontinuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populations\nwith hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratio\nbecomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatial\nstructure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel and\ncounterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustains\ncooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner's\ndilemma and also of the \"rock-paper-scissor\" game we find indications of rich\nstructure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other models\nwith explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity and\nthe emergence of global oscillations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2007 11:02:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2007 15:49:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2008 11:29:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

This provides sufficient conditions for a process that\nsatisfies the definition of an SRBM, except for small random perturbations in\nthe defining conditions, to be close in distribution to an SRBM. A crucial\ningredient in the proof of this result is an oscillation inequality for\nsolutions of a perturbed Skorokhod problem.

We also use the invariance\nprinciple, in conjunction with known uniqueness results for SRBMs, to give some\nsufficient conditions for validating approximations involving (i) SRBMs in\nconvex polyhedrons with a constant reflection vector field on each face of the\npolyhedron, and (ii) SRBMs in bounded domains with piecewise smooth boundaries\nand possibly nonconstant reflection vector fields on the boundary surfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2007 14:30:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}
