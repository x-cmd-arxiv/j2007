Surprisingly,\nhowever, we discovered dramatic variability of the lines over the duration of\nthe present observation. For instance, the flux of the Ne X line at 12.14 \\AA\\\nwas about $5 \\times 10^{-3}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the early part of\nthe observation but became subsequently undetectable, with a 99% upper limit of\n$0.06 \\times 10^{-3}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ on the flux of the line. This\nimplies that the line weakened by nearly two orders of magnitude on a timescale\nof hours. The overall X-ray flux of the source did also vary during the\nobservation but only by 20--30%. For Cyg X-1, the absorption lines are\ngenerally attributed to the absorption of X-rays by ionized stellar wind in the\nbinary system. Therefore, they may provide valuable diagnostics on the physical\ncondition of the wind. We discuss the implications of the results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2007 17:45:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

A neural circuit can be thought of as a\ndirected multigraph whose each vertex is a neuron and each edge is a synapse.\nIt has been assumed in this paper that the behavior of such circuits is\nmanifested through the collective behavior of neurons belonging to that\ncircuit. Behavioral information of each neuron is contained in the coefficients\nof the fast Fourier transform (FFT) over the output spike train. Those\ncoefficients form a vector in a multidimensional vector space. Behavioral\ndynamics of a neuronal network in response to strong aversive stimuli has been\nstudied in a vector space in which a suitable pseudometric has been defined.\nThe neurodynamical model of network behavior has been formulated in terms of\nexisting memory, synaptic plasticity and feelings. The model has an analogy in\nclassical electrostatics, by which the notion of force and potential energy has\nbeen introduced. Since the model takes input from each neuron in a network and\nproduces a behavior as the output, it would be extremely difficult or may even\nbe impossible to implement.

As a result, the strength of HI absorption\nnear galaxies is not reduced by galactic winds, but even slightly increases. We\nalso find that a lack of HI absorption for lines of sight (LOS) close to\ngalaxies, as found by Adelberger et al., can be created by hot gas around the\ngalaxies induced by accretion shock heating. In contrast to HI, metal\nabsorption systems are sensitive to the presence of winds. The models without\nfeedback can produce the strong CIV and OVI absorption lines in LOS within 50\nkpc from galaxies, while strong SN feedback is capable of creating strong CIV\nand OVI lines out to about twice that distance. We also analyze the mean\ntransmissivity of HI, CIV, and OVI within 1 h$^{-1}$ Mpc from star-forming\ngalaxies. The probability distribution of the transmissivity of HI is\nindependent of the strength of SN feedback, but strong feedback produces LOS\nwith lower transmissivity of metal lines.

We also model the emission from the boundary between the LIC and\nthe hot Local Bubble (LB) plasma, assuming that the cloud is evaporating\nbecause of thermal conduction. We create a grid of models covering a plausible\nrange of LIC and LB properties, and use the modeled radiation field as input to\nradiative transfer/thermal equilibrium calculations using the Cloudy code. Data\nfrom in situ observations of He^O, pickup ions and anomalous cosmic rays in the\nheliosphere, and absorption line measurements towards epsilon CMa were used to\nconstrain the input parameters. A restricted range of assumed LIC HI column\ndensities and LB plasma temperatures produce models that match all the\nobservational constraints. The relative weakness of the constraints on N(HI)\nand T_h contrast with the narrow limits predicted for the H^O and electron\ndensity in the LIC at the Sun, n(H^0) = 0.19 - 0.20 cm^-3, and n(e) = 0.07 +/-\n0.01 cm^-3.

Such a dynamical evolution process is included\nhere in calculations for the J/psi number distribution as a function of\ntransverse momentum and rapidity in central Au-Au collisions at both RHIC and\nLHC energies. The ccbar pairs are produced in the initial collision and in the\npartonic system during the prethermal and thermal stages through the partonic\nchannels ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] and ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J]x, and then they\ndissociate in the latter two stages.

There are\nmodest yields of ccbar in the prethermal stage at RHIC energy and through the\nreactions ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] at LHC energy for partons with large average\nmomentum in the prethermal stage at both collider energies and in the thermal\nstage at LHC energy.

The low radio flux\nemitted by this object, however, is inconsistent with a hard state\ninterpretation. The accretion rate of NGC 3783 (~7% of the Eddington rate) is\nsimilar to that of other AGN with `soft' state PSDs and higher than that at\nwhich the GBH Cyg X-1, with which AGN are often compared, changes between\n`hard' and `soft' states (~2% of the Eddington rate).

Thus NGC 3783 is not\nunusual. These results leave Arakelian 564 as the only AGN which shows a second\nbreak at low frequencies, although in that case the very high accretion rate\nimplies a `very high', rather than `hard' state PSD. The break frequency found\nin NGC 3783 is consistent with the expectation based on comparisons with other\nAGN and GBHs, given its black hole mass and accretion rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2007 13:23:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

The bolometric luminosities and the M_BH-L_K relation are\nused to provide an estimate of the masses and Eddington ratios of the black\nholes residing in these AGN.\n  Results: All of our sources are detected in the IRAC and MIPS (at 24 micron)\nbands. The SED modeling described above is in good agreement with the observed\nnear- and mid-infrared data. The derived bolometric luminosities are in the\nrange ~10^45-10^47 erg s^-1, and the median 2--10 keV bolometric correction is\n~25, consistent with the widely adopted value derived by Elvis et al. (1994).\nFor the objects with elliptical-like profiles in the K_s band, we derive high\nstellar masses (0.8-6.2)X10^11 Mo, black hole masses in the range\n(0.2-2.5)X10^9 Mo, and Eddington ratios L/L_Edd<0.1, suggesting a low-accretion\nphase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2007 14:50:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2007 10:48:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We use a ``natural'' refinement equation whose solution (a\nrefinable function) is the characteristic function of the unit disc. This\nequation reflects the fact that the characteristic function of the unit disc is\nthe sum of $p$ characteristic functions of disjoint discs of radius $p^{-1}$.\nThe case $p=2$ is studied in detail. Our MRA is a 2-adic analog of the real\nHaar MRA. But in contrast to the real setting, the refinable function\ngenerating our Haar MRA is periodic with period 1, which never holds for real\nrefinable functions. This fact implies that there exist infinity many different\n2-adic orthonormal wavelet bases in ${\\cL}^2(\\bQ_2)$ generated by the same Haar\nMRA. All of these bases are constructed. Since $p$-adic pseudo-differential\noperators are closely related to wavelet-type bases, our bases can be\nintensively used for applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2007 14:55:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
