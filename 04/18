The periods and colours we derive for Sycorax are in\nagreement with our previous determination in 1999 using NTT.

However, the sparseness of our data, prevents a\nmore precise characterization of the light-curves, and we can not determine\nwether they are one-peaked or two-peaked. Hence, these periods and amplitudes\nhave to be considered preliminary estimates. As for Setebos, Stephano and\nTrinculo the present data do not allow to derive any unambiguous periodicity,\ndespite Setebos displays a significant variability with amplitude about as\nlarge as that of Prospero.

The present GRB samples with redshift\ndetermination are largely incomplete and therefore a careful analysis of\nselection effects is mandatory before any conclusion can be drawn from the\nobserved GRB redshift distribution. We study and compare three well defined\nsamples of long GRBs detected by Swift, HETE2 and BeppoSAX. We find that Swift\nGRBs are slighly fainter and harder than BeppoSAX and HETE2 GRBs, as expected\ndue to the higher energy range in which Swift GRBs are detected and localized,\ncompared to BeppoSAX and HETE2. Gas and dust obscuration plays a role in\nshaping the GRB samples and the present samples of GRBs with redshift. We argue\nthat the majority of the bright Swift GRBs without redshift might actually be\nz<~2 events therefore the present Swift GRB sample with redshift is biased\nagainst low-z GRBs. On the other hand, the detection of bright UV rest-frame\nafterglows from high-z GRBs, and even from those with large X-ray obscuration,\nimplies a dust amount lower than in nearby GRBs,and/or a different dust\ncomposition. If this is the case, the Swift sample of GRBs with redshifts is\nprobably a fair sample of the real high-z GRB population. The absence of high-z\nGRBs in the BeppoSAX and HETE2 samples of GRBs with redshifts is probably due\nto the fact at the time of BeppoSAX and HETE2 follow-up faint afterglows of\nhigh redshift GRBs will have weaken below the spectroscopic capabilities of\neven 10m class telescopes.

The best match with HI rotational velocities is obtained with\nPolyex widths, which are measured at the optical radius (encompassing a fixed\nfraction of the total light of the galaxy) from a model fit to the rotation\ncurve. In contrast with Polyex widths, optical rotational velocities measured\nat 2.15 disk scale lengths r_d deviate from HI widths by an amount that\ncorrelates with the central surface brightness of the disk. This bias occurs\nbecause the rotation curves of galaxies are in general still rising at 2.15\nr_d, and the fraction of total mass contained within this radius decreases with\nincreasing disk surface brightness.

How the electroweak\ngauge symmetry is hidden is one of the most urgent and challenging questions\nfacing particle physics. The provisional answer incorporated in the \"standard\nmodel\" of particle physics was formulated in the 1960s by Higgs, by Brout &\nEnglert, and by Guralnik, Hagen & Kibble: The agent of electroweak symmetry\nbreaking is an elementary scalar field whose self-interactions select a vacuum\nstate in which the full electroweak symmetry is hidden, leaving a residual\nphase symmetry of electromagnetism. By analogy with the Meissner effect of the\nsuperconducting phase transition, the Higgs mechanism, as it is commonly known,\nconfers masses on the weak force carriers W and Z.

The lack of any bright SN down to\nvery strict limits and the vanishing spectral lags are typical of short GRBs,\nstrikingly at odds with the long (102s) duration of this event. Here we present\nspectral and temporal analysis of the Swift observations. We show that the\nburst presents standard optical, UV and X-ray afterglows. An achromatic break\nis observed simultaneously in optical and X-rays, at a time consistent with the\nbreak in the R-band light curve measured by the VLT. The achromatic behaviour\nand the consistent post-break decay slopes make GRB 060614 one of the best\nexamples of a jet break for a Swift burst. The optical, UV and X-rays afterglow\nlight curves have also an earlier break at ~30 ks. In the optical, there is\nstrong spectral evolution around this break, suggesting the passage of a break\nfrequency through the optical/UV band. The very blue spectrum at early times\nand the trend in the light curves (rising at low frequencies, and decaying at\nhigher energies) suggest this may be the injection frequency. The early X-ray\nlight curve is well interpreted as the X-ray counterpart of the burst extended\nemission. Spectral analysis of BAT/XRT data in the 80s overlap time show that\nthe Ep of the burst has decreased to as low as 8keV at the beginning of the XRT\nobservation. The Ep continues to decrease through the XRT energy band and exits\nit at about 500s after the trigger. The average Ep of the burst is likely < 24\nkeV but larger than 8 keV. The initial peak observed by BAT is however\ndistinctly harder than the rest with Ep ~300 keV as measured by Konus Wind.\nConsidering the time-averaged spectral properties, GRB 060614 is consistent\nwith the Eiso-Ep_rest, Egamma-Ep_rest, and Liso-Ep correlations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2007 20:14:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-11"}

The progenitor suffered an LBV-like\noutburst just 2 yr earlier, and we propose that the dust formation is a\nconsequence of the SN blast wave overtaking that LBV-like shell. The key\nevidence for dust formation is (a) the appearance of a red/near-IR continuum\nsource fit by 1600 K graphite grains, and (b) fading of the redshifted sides of\nHe I emission lines, yielding progressively more asymmetric blueshifted lines\nas dust obscures receding material. This provides the strongest case yet for\ndust formation in any SN Ib/c. Both developments occurred between 51 and 75 d\nafter peak, while other SNe observed to form dust did so after a few hundred\ndays. Geometric considerations indicate that dust formed in the dense swept-up\nshell between the forward and reverse shocks, and not in the freely expanding\nSN ejecta. Rapid cooling leading to dust formation may have been aided by\nextremely high shell densities, as indicated by He I line ratios. The brief\nepoch of dust formation is accompanied by He II 4686 emission and enhanced\nX-ray emission.

Here we argue that these difficulties arise owing to the significant\nmodulation of the solar activity cycle, and that this modulation arises owing\nto either stochastic or deterministic processes. We analyse the implications\nfor predictability in both of these situations by considering two separate\nsolar dynamo models. The first model represents a stochastically-perturbed flux\ntransport dynamo. Here even very weak stochastic perturbations can give rise to\nsignificant modulation in the activity cycle. This modulation leads to a loss\nof predictability. In the second model, we neglect stochastic effects and\nassume that generation of magnetic field in the Sun can be described by a fully\ndeterministic nonlinear mean-field model -- this is a best case scenario for\nprediction. We designate the output from this deterministic model (with\nparameters chosen to produce chaotically modulated cycles) as a target\ntimeseries that subsequent deterministic mean-field models are required to\npredict. Long-term prediction is impossible even if a model that is correct in\nall details is utilised in the prediction. Furthermore, we show that even\nshort-term prediction is impossible if there is a small discrepancy in the\ninput parameters from the fiducial model. This is the case even if the\npredicting model has been tuned to reproduce the output of previous cycles.\nGiven the inherent uncertainties in determining the transport coefficients and\nnonlinear responses for mean-field models, we argue that this makes predicting\nthe solar cycle using the output from such models impossible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2007 13:22:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

This effect of electron-electron interactions upon\n|ts(E_F)|^2 is studied using a one dimensional model of spinless fermions and\nthe Hartree-Fock approximation. The non locality of |ts(E_F)|^2 is due to the\ncoupling between the Hartree and Fock corrections inside the nano-system and\nthe scatterers outside the nano-system via long range Friedel oscillations.\nUsing this phenomenon, one can vary |ts(E_F)|^2 by an Aharonov-Bohm flux\nthreading a ring which is attached to one lead at a distance Lc from the\nnano-system. For small distances Lc, the variation of the quantum conductance\ninduced by this non local effect can exceed 0.1 (e^2/h).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2007 15:42:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-09"}
