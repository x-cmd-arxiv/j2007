A strong soft excess below 1 keV is observed in the time-averaged\nHETG spectrum, which can be parameterized with a steep power law or a thermal\nmodel.

The gravitational field of the system is\ndominated by the black hole in its sphere of influence. It is further modified\nby the cluster mean field (a spherical term) and a gaseous disc/torus (an\naxially symmetric term) causing a secular evolution of stellar orbits via Kozai\noscillations. Intermittent phases of large eccentricity increase the chance\nthat stars become damaged inside the tidal radius of the central hole. Such\nevents can produce debris and lead to recurring episodes of enhanced accretion\nactivity. We introduce an effective loss cone and associate it with tidal\ndisruptions during the high-eccentricity phases of the Kozai cycle. By\nnumerical integration of the trajectories forming the boundary of the loss cone\nwe determine its shape and volume. We also include the effect of relativistic\nadvance of pericentre.

In the end we expect the tidal disruption events\nto be approximately ten times more frequent in comparison with the model in\nwhich the three effects -- the cluster mean field, the relativistic pericentre\nadvance, and the Kozai mechanism -- are all ignored.

We describe the former process\nwith the coupled-channels framework, while the latter with the WKB\napproximation by taking into account the coordinate dependent inertia mass. The\neffect of the one-body barrier is important at incident energies below the\npotential energy at the touching configuration.

The manuscript was submitted to Chemical Engineering Science. To\nclarify the situation, we copy the main comment from an anonymous referee here:\n\"To my understanding, the authors analyze i = 1 ... 63 time series and\ncalculate their mean and standard deviation. These time series correspond to\nindividual, single ignition processes. Is this correct? If yes, these\nprocesses, as Fig. 3 shows very clearly, are not stationary, and the pressure\ndifference (i.e., the signal) quickly decays to zero. In this case both the\nmean and the standard deviation are poorly defined, for example because both\ndepend in a trivial fashion on the observation period T. I am not aware of any\nstudy (including those cited by the authors) which allows for any conclusion\nfrom such non-stationary signals. The results of Menezes and Barabasi are\nstrictly only valid for stationary time series, and they cannot be applied at\nall in this case.\" We agree with this insightful comment that our data are not\nstationary and the method adopted in our manuscript does not apply.
