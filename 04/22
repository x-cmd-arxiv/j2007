At low photon fluxes this\nbehavior reflects the time and energy entanglement between the down-converted\nphotons. However, two-photon interactions such as two-photon absorption (TPA)\nand sum-frequency generation (SFG) can exhibit such a behavior even at high\npower levels, as long as the final state (i.e. the atomic level in TPA, or the\ngenerated light in SFG) is narrowband enough. This behavior does not depend on\nthe squeezing properties of the light, is insensitive to linear losses, and has\npotential applications. In this paper we describe analytically this behavior\nfor travelling-wave down-conversion with continuous or pulsed pumping, both for\nhigh- and low-power regimes. For this we derive a quantum-mechanical expression\nfor the down-converted amplitude generated by an arbitrary pump, and formulate\noperators that represent various two-photon interactions induced by broadband\nlight. This model is in excellent agreement with experimental results of TPA\nand SFG with high power down-converted light and with entangled photons [Dayan\net al., Phys. Rev.

Radiation from the protostar\npushes the inner wall of the disk outward. The material agglomerates and forms\nplanets in radial sequence. The outer planets are formed slowly by classical\ndynamical mechanisms acting in the snow zone. Planets have dense cores because\nof agglomeration.\n  Not one of the exoplanets discovered thus far is a planet. They are\ncryptoplanets formed from matter ejected by protostars. When protostars have\nexcessive infall at high latitudes, they partially balance angular momentum\nthrough outflow at the equator as they spin up. The ejected matter is trapped\nin the magnetic torus formed between the star and the disk, like a tokamak.

The fraction of BALQSOs is\n40.4^{+3.4}_{-3.3}% in the 2MASS 99% database K_s band completeness sample, and\n38.5^{+1.7}_{-1.7}% in the larger 2MASS sample extending below the completeness\nlimit. These fractions are significantly higher than the 26% reported in the\noptical bands for the same parent sample. We also present the fraction of\nBALQSOs as functions of apparent magnitudes, absolute magnitudes, and redshift\nin the 2MASS and SDSS bands. The 2MASS fractions are consistently higher than\nthe SDSS fractions in every comparison, and the BALQSO fractions steadily\nincrease with wavelength from the SDSS u to the 2MASS K_s bands. Furthermore,\nthe i - K_s color distributions of BALQSOs and non-BALQSOs indicate that\nBALQSOs are redder than non-BALQSOs, with a K-S test probability of 2e-12.\nThese results are consistent with the spectral difference between BALQSOs and\nnon-BALQSOs including both the absorption troughs and dust extinction in\nBALQSOs, which leads to significant selection biases against BALQSOs in the\noptical bands. Using a simple simulation incorporating the luminosity function\nof quasars and the amount of obscuration for BALQSOs, we simultaneously fit the\nBALQSO fractions in the SDSS and 2MASS bands. We obtain a true BALQSO fraction\nof 43\\pm2% for luminous quasars (M_{K_s} \\lesssim -30.1 mag).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Apr 2007 13:31:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2007 15:42:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-18"}

It suggests that, far\nfrom being group-dependent, segregation mechanisms are instead\nsituation-dependent. More precisely, the degree of integration of a minority in\nterms of the frequency of intermarriage is seen to crucially depend upon the\nthe proportion p of the minority. Thus, a population may have a segregative\nbehavior with respect to a high-p (p>20%) minority A and at the same time a\ntolerant attitude toward a low-p (p<2%) minority B. This remains true even when\nA and B represent the same minority; for instance Black-White intermarriage is\nmuch more frequent in Montana than it is in South Carolina.

The reduced vector field has a remarkable hydrodynamic interpretation:\nit is a velocity field for a stationary flow of an ideal fluid. Right- or\nleft-invariant symmetry fields of the reduced field define vortex manifolds for\nsuch flows.\n  Consider now a mechanical system, whose configuration space is a Lie group\nand whose Lagrangian is invariant to left translations on that group, and\nassume that the mass geometry of the system may change under the action of\ninternal control forces. Such system can also be reduced to the Lie group. With\nno controls, this mechanical system describes a geodesic flow of the\nleft-invariant metric, given by the Lagrangian, and thus its reduced flow is a\nstationary ideal fluid flow on the Lie group. The standard control problem for\nsuch system is to find the conditions, under which the system can be brought\nfrom any initial position in the configuration space to another preassigned\nposition by changing its mass geometry.

M67 is well studied but the lack of a wide and deep Stromgren\nphotometric study makes our results worthwhile.
