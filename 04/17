While the quoted paper\ndeals with Wolf-Rayet stars which evolved through a red supergiant stage, we\ninvestigate here the initially more massive Wolf-Rayet stars which are thought\nto evolve through a Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) stage. We perform hydrodynamic\nsimulations of the evolution of the circumstellar medium around a 60 Msol star,\nfrom the main sequence through the LBV and Wolf-Rayet stages, up to core\ncollapse. We then compute the column density of the circumstellar matter as a\nfunction of radial velocity, time and angle. This allows a comparison with the\nnumber and blue-shifts, of absorption components in the spectra of LBVs,\nWolf-Rayet stars, Type Ib/c supernovae and gamma-ray burst afterglows. Our\nsimulation for the post-LBV stage shows the formation of various absorption\ncomponents, which are, however, rather short lived; they dissipate on time\nscales shorter than 50,000yr. As the LBV stage is thought to occur at the\nbeginning of core helium burning, the remaining Wolf-Rayet life time is\nexpected to be one order of magnitude larger. When interpreting the absorption\ncomponents in the afterglow spectrum of GRB-021004 as circumstellar, it can be\nconcluded that the progenitor of this source did most likely not evolve through\nan LBV stage.

We examine two subsamples, one containing the systems with emission\nline ratios most like star-forming systems, and one with the sources that have\ncharacteristic AGN ratios. This division also separates the mechanism\nresponsible for the radio emission (star-formation vs. AGN). For both cases we\nfind a strong, almost identical, correlation between [OIII] and radio\nluminosity, with the AGN sample extending toward lower, and the star-formation\nsample toward higher luminosities. A clearer separation between the two\nsubsamples is seen as function of the central velocity dispersion of the host\ngalaxy. For systems with similar redshifts and velocity dispersions, the\nstar-formation subsample is brighter than the AGN in the radio by an order of\nmagnitude.

We\nextend our analysis here to a sample of 42 nearby (V < 7000 km/s) Seyfert\ngalaxies hosted by early-type galaxies. We used the available HST images to\nstudy their brightness profiles. Having excluded complex and highly nucleated\ngalaxies, in the remaining 16 objects the brightness profiles can be\nsuccessfully modeled with a Nuker law with a steep nuclear cusp characteristic\nof ``power-law'' galaxies (with logarithmic slope 0.51 - 1.07).

The key problem, that we\ntry to solve in this paper is the probabilistic interpretation of the BFKL\nPomeron Calculus in terms of the colourless dipoles and their interactions. We\ndemonstrate that the BFKL Pomeron Calculus has two equivalent descriptions :\n(i) one is the generating functional which gives a clear probabilistic\ninterpretation of the processes of high energy scattering and also provides a\nHamiltonian-like description of the system of interacting dipoles; (ii) the\nsecond is the Langevin equation with a specific noise term which is rather\ncomplicated. We found that at high energies this Langevin equation can be\nreduced to the Langevin equation for directed percolation in the momentum space\nif the impact parameter is large, namely, $b>> 1/k$, where $k$ is the\ntransverse momentum of a dipole. Unfortunately, this simplified form of\nLangevin equation is not applicable for summation of Pomeron loops, where one\nintegrates over all possible values of impact parameter. We show that the BFKL\nPomeron calculus with two vertices (splitting $P\\to P+P$ and merging $P+P\\to P$\nof Pomerons) can be interpreted as a system of colourless dipoles with two\nprocesses: the decay of one dipole into two and the merging of two dipoles into\none dipole. However, a number of assumptions we have to make on the way to\nsimplify the noise term in the Langevin equation and/or to apply the\nprobabilistic interpretation, therefore, we can consider both of these\napproaches in the present form only as the QCD motivated models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2007 10:08:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 May 2007 14:08:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Materials and methods: We have used\nmicroplate spectrophotometry to measure the growth kinetics of hundreds of\nindividual cell clones from the Molt3 cell line. The growth rate of each clonal\npopulation has been estimated by fitting experimental data with the logistic\nequation. Results: The growth rates were observed to vary among different\nclones. Up to six clones with a growth rate above or below the mean growth rate\nof the parent population were further cloned and the growth rates of their\noffsprings were measured. The distribution of the growth rates of the subclones\ndid not significantly differ from that of the parent population thus suggesting\nthat growth variability has an epigenetic origin. To explain the observed\ndistributions of clonal growth rates we have developed a probabilistic model\nassuming that the fluctuations in the number of mitochondria through successive\ncell cycles are the leading cause of growth variability. For fitting purposes,\nwe have estimated experimentally by flow cytometry the maximum average number\nof mitochondria in Molt3 cells. The model fits nicely the observed\ndistributions of growth rates, however, cells in which the mitochondria were\nrendered non functional (rho-0 cells) showed only a 30% reduction in the clonal\ngrowth variability with respect to normal cells. Conclusions: A tumor cell\npopulation is a dynamic ensemble of clones with highly variable growth rate. At\nleast part of this variability is due to fluctuations in the number of\nmitochondria.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2007 10:30:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The main results are the following. 1) The\ncirrus noise level as a function of brightness has been previously\noverestimated. It is found to be proportional to <I> instead of <I>^1.5, where\n<I> is the local average brightness at 100 micron. This scaling is in\naccordance with the fact that the brightness fluctuation level observed at a\ngiven angular scale on the sky is the sum of fluctuations of increasing\namplitude with distance on the line of sight. 2) The spectral index of dust\nemission at scales between 5 arcmin and 12.5 degrees is <gamma>=-2.9 on average\nbut shows significant variations over the sky. Bright regions have\nsystematically steeper power spectra than diffuse regions. 3) The skewness and\nkurtosis of brightness fluctuations is high, indicative of strong\nnon-Gaussianity. 4) Based on our characterization of the 100 micron power\nspectrum we provide a prescription of the cirrus confusion noise as a function\nof wavelength and scale. 5) Finally we present a method based on a modification\nof Gaussian random fields to produce simulations of dust maps which reproduce\nthe power spectrum and non-Gaussian properties of interstellar dust emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2007 15:16:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The behaviour of the\nautomaton is mainly determined by the support of the random variable that\nselects one of the sixteen possible Boolean rules, independently for each cell.\nA cell is said to stabilize if it will not change its state anymore after some\ntime. We classify the random boolean automata according to the positivity of\ntheir probability of stabilization. Here is an example of a consequence of our\nresults: if the support contains at least 5 rules, then asymptotically as $N$\ntends to infinity the probability of stabilization is positive, whereas there\nexist random boolean cellular automata with 4 rules in their support for which\nthis probability tends to 0.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2007 15:37:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2007 14:15:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2008 10:42:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-07"}
