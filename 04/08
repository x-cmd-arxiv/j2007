With increasing environmental dielectric constant\n($\\epsilon_{\\rm env}$), both $E_{11}$ and $E_{22}$ exhibited a redshift by\nseveral tens meV and a tendency to saturate at a $\\epsilon_{\\rm env} \\sim 5$\nwithout an indication of significant ($n$,$m$) dependence. The redshifts can be\nexplained by dielectric screening of the repulsive electron-electron\ninteraction. The $\\epsilon_{\\rm env}$ dependence of $E_{11}$ and $E_{22}$ can\nbe expressed by a simple empirical equation with a power law in $\\epsilon_{\\rm\nenv}$, $E_{\\rm ii} = E_{\\rm ii}^{\\infty} + A\\epsilon_{\\rm env}^{-\\alpha}$.

Given a weighted directed acyclic graph whose edge weights\ncan change in an arbitrary (adversarial) way, a decision maker has to choose in\neach round of a game a path between two distinguished vertices such that the\nloss of the chosen path (defined as the sum of the weights of its composing\nedges) be as small as possible. In a setting generalizing the multi-armed\nbandit problem, after choosing a path, the decision maker learns only the\nweights of those edges that belong to the chosen path. For this problem, an\nalgorithm is given whose average cumulative loss in n rounds exceeds that of\nthe best path, matched off-line to the entire sequence of the edge weights, by\na quantity that is proportional to 1/\\sqrt{n} and depends only polynomially on\nthe number of edges of the graph. The algorithm can be implemented with linear\ncomplexity in the number of rounds n and in the number of edges. An extension\nto the so-called label efficient setting is also given, in which the decision\nmaker is informed about the weights of the edges corresponding to the chosen\npath at a total of m << n time instances. Another extension is shown where the\ndecision maker competes against a time-varying path, a generalization of the\nproblem of tracking the best expert. A version of the multi-armed bandit\nsetting for shortest path is also discussed where the decision maker learns\nonly the total weight of the chosen path but not the weights of the individual\nedges on the path. Applications to routing in packet switched networks along\nwith simulation results are also presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Apr 2007 10:15:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
