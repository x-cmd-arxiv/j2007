As a result of this coupling, neutrinos in the\nearly universe instead of streaming freely could form a self-coupled fluid,\nwith potentially observable signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background and\nthe large scale structure of the universe. We re-examine the constraints on\nthis scenario from the presently available cosmological data and investigate\nthe sensitivity expected from the Planck satellite. In the first case, we find\nthat the sensitivity strongly depends on which piece of data is used. The SDSS\nMain sample data, combined with WMAP and other data, disfavors the scenario of\nthree coupled neutrinos at about the 3.5$\\sigma$ confidence level, but also\nfavors a high number of freely streaming neutrinos, with the best fit at 5.2.\nIf the matter power spectrum is instead taken from the SDSS Large Red Galaxy\nsample, best fit point has 2.5 freely streaming neutrinos, but the scenario\nwith three coupled neutrinos becomes allowed at $2\\sigma$. In contrast, Planck\nalone will exclude even a single self-coupled neutrino at the $4.2\\sigma$\nconfidence level, and will determine the total radiation at CMB epoch to\n$\\Delta N_\\nu^{eff} = ^{+0.5}_{-0.3}$ ($1\\sigma$ errors). We investigate the\nrobustness of this result with respect to the details of Planck's detector.\nThis sensitivity to neutrino free-streaming implies that Planck will be capable\nof probing a large region of the Mass-Varying Neutrino parameter space. Planck\nmay also be sensitive to a scale of neutrino mass generation as high as 1 TeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2007 18:58:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Sensing capacity is defined as the maximum number of signal dimensions\nreliably identified per sensor observation. In this context sparsity of the\nphenomena is a key feature that determines sensing capacity. Precluding the SNR\nof the environment the effect of sparsity on the number of measurements\nrequired for accurate reconstruction of a sparse phenomena has been widely\ndealt with under compressed sensing. Nevertheless the development there was\nmotivated from an algorithmic perspective. In this paper our aim is to derive\nthese bounds in an information theoretic set-up and thus provide algorithm\nindependent conditions for reliable reconstruction of sparse signals. In this\ndirection we first generalize the Fano's inequality and provide lower bounds to\nthe probability of error in reconstruction subject to an arbitrary distortion\ncriteria. Using these lower bounds to the probability of error, we derive upper\nbounds to sensing capacity and show that for fixed SNR regime sensing capacity\ngoes down to zero as sparsity goes down to zero. This means that\ndisproportionately more sensors are required to monitor very sparse events. Our\nnext main contribution is that we show the effect of sensing diversity on\nsensing capacity, an effect that has not been considered before. Sensing\ndiversity is related to the effective \\emph{coverage} of a sensor with respect\nto the field.

Particles diffuse through the medium of the open\ncluster during the activity time of the acceleration scenario defined by the\nage of the WR star. They interact with the matter and radiation, at first\ninside the open cluster and, later in the dense surrounding clouds. We\ncalculate the broad band spectrum in different processes for three example open\nclusters (Berk 87, Cyg OB2, Westerlund 2) for which the best observational\nconstraints on the spectra are at present available. It is assumed that the\nhigh energy phenomena, observed from the X-ray up to the GeV-TeV gamma-ray\nenergies, are related to each other. We conclude that the most likely\ndescription of the radiation processes in these objects is achieved in the\nhybrid (leptonic-hadronic) model in which leptons are responsible for the\nobserved X-ray and GeV gamma-ray emission and hadrons are responsible for the\nTeV gamma-ray emission, which is produced directly inside and in dense clouds\nsurrounding the open cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Apr 2007 11:34:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2007 13:34:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-21"}

It has been found that hole doping with Li decreases the\nsuperconducting transition temperature Tc, but at a slower rate than electron\ndoping with C or Al. Tc of MgB2 crystals with simultaneously substituted Li for\nMg and C for B decreases more than in the case where C is substituted alone.\nThis means that holes introduced by Li cannot counterbalance the effect of\ndecrease of Tc caused by introduction of electrons coming from C. The possible\nreason of it can be that holes coming from Li occupy the pi band while\nelectrons coming from C fill the sigma band. The temperature dependences of the\nupper critical field Hc2 for Al and Li substituted crystals with the same Tc\nshow a similar dHc2/dT slope at Tc and a similar Hc2(T) behavior, despite of\nmuch different substitution level. This indicates that the mechanism\ncontrolling Hc2 and Tc is similar in both hole and electron doped crystals.\nElectrical transport measurements show an increase of resistivity both in Li\nsubstituted crystals and in Li and C co-substituted crystals. This indicates\nenhanced scattering due to defects introduced by substitutions including\ndistortion of the lattice. The observed behavior can be explained as a result\nof two effects, influencing both Tc and Hc2. The first one is doping related to\nthe changes in the carrier concentration, which may lead to the decrease or to\nthe increase of Tc. The second one is related to the introduction of new\nscattering centers leading to the modification of the interband and/or\nintraband scattering and therefore, to changes in the superconducting gaps and\nto the reduction of Tc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Apr 2007 12:30:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-16"}

Using detailed\nhydrodynamic simulations of gas clouds in minihalos subject to destructive\nprocesses associated with the encompassing intergalactic shocks carrying\nmetal-enriched gas, we find, as an example, that, for realistic shocks of\nvelocities of 10-100km/s, more than (90%,65%) of the high density gas with\nrho>500 rhob inside a minihalo virialized at z=10 of mass (10^7,10^6)Msun\nremains at a metallicity lower than 3% of that of the intergalactic medium by\nredshift z=6.

As an application we study the\nrecently introduced domain-wall/cosmology correspondence in this approach. We\ngive an example in 9d and 10d where the domain-wall and corresponding cosmology\ncan be viewed as different real slices of the same complex solution. We argue\nhow in this case the pseudo-supersymmetry of the cosmological solutions can be\nunderstood as the invariance under supersymmetry of a variant supergravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Apr 2007 14:47:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

In this paper we present the\n92-cm data and a comparison is made with the already published 21-cm results.\nWe analysed 191 pulsars at 92 cm using fluctuation spectra. The sample of\npulsars is as unbiased as possible towards any particular pulsar\ncharacteristics.

It is estimated\nthat at least half of the total population of pulsars have drifting subpulses\nwhen observations with a high enough signal-to-noise ratio would be available.\nIt could well be that the drifting subpulse mechanism is an intrinsic property\nof the emission mechanism itself, although for some pulsars it is difficult or\nimpossible to detect. Drifting subpulses are in general found at both\nfrequencies, although the chance of detecting drifting subpulses is possibly\nslightly higher at 92 cm. It appears that the youngest pulsars have the most\ndisordered subpulses and the subpulses become more and more organized into\ndrifting subpulses as the pulsar ages. The correlations with the modulation\nindices are argued to be consistent with the picture in which the radio\nemission can be divided in a drifting subpulse signal plus a quasi-steady\nsignal which becomes, on average, stronger at high observing frequencies.
