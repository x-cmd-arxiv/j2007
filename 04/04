The observations resolved the\nhot molecular core into six submm continuum sources with the finest spatial\nresolution of 0.36''x0.25'' (~1800AU) achieved so far. Four of them located\nwithin 7800(AU)^2 comprise a proto-Trapezium system with estimated protostellar\ndensities of 1.4x0^5 protostars/pc^3.

The derived hot core\ntemperatures are of the order 300K.

The\nSiO(8-7) emission outlines likely two molecular outflows emanating from this\nhot core region. Emission from most other molecules peaks centrally on the hot\ncore and is not dominated by any individual submm peak. Potential reasons for\nthat are discussed.

It has\ngenerally been assumed in prior studies that the many-to-one throughput\ncapacity is upper-bounded by the link capacity L. Throughput capacity L is not\nachievable under 802.11. This paper introduces the notion of \"canonical\nnetworks\", which is a class of regularly-structured networks whose capacities\ncan be analyzed more easily than unstructured networks. We show that the\nthroughput capacity of canonical networks under 802.11 has an analytical upper\nbound of 3L/4 when the source nodes are two or more hops away from the sink;\nand simulated throughputs of 0.690L (0.740L) when the source nodes are many\nhops away. We conjecture that 3L/4 is also the upper bound for general\nnetworks. When all links have equal length, 2L/3 can be shown to be the upper\nbound for general networks. Our simulations show that 802.11 networks with\nrandom topologies operated with AODV routing can only achieve throughputs far\nbelow the upper bounds. Fortunately, by properly selecting routes near the\ngateway (or by properly positioning the relay nodes leading to the gateway) to\nfashion after the structure of canonical networks, the throughput can be\nimproved significantly by more than 150%. Indeed, in a dense network, it is\nworthwhile to deactivate some of the relay nodes near the sink judiciously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2007 09:17:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-13"}

With an internal symmetry group $G$ having $D$ generators\nnot only the pure Lorentz symmetry SO(1,3), but the larger accidental symmetry\n$SO(D,3D)$ of the SLIV constraint in itself appears to be spontaneously broken\nas well. As a result, while the pure Lorentz violation still generates only one\ngenuine Goldstone vector boson, the accompanying pseudo-Goldstone vector bosons\nrelated to the $SO(D,3D)$ breaking also come into play in the final arrangement\nof the entire Goldstone vector field multiplet. Remarkably, they remain\nstrictly massless, being protected by gauge invariance of the Yang-Mills theory\ninvolved. We show that, although this theory contains a plethora of Lorentz and\n$CPT$ violating couplings, they do not lead to physical SLIV effects which turn\nout to be strictly cancelled in all the lowest order processes considered.\nHowever, the physical Lorentz violation could appear if the internal gauge\ninvariance were slightly broken at very small distances influenced by gravity.\nFor the SLIV scale comparable with the Planck one the Lorentz violation could\nbecome directly observable at low energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2007 11:58:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 May 2007 14:42:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 24 May 2007 22:08:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2007 01:34:42 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 15 Sep 2007 05:40:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We develop a general\nscheme for constructing composite-fermion (CF) wave functions from conformal\nfield theory. Quasiparticles at $\\nu=1/m$ are created by inserting anyonic\nvertex operators, $P_{\\frac{1}{m}}(z)$, that replace a subset of the electron\noperators in the correlator. The one-quasiparticle wave function is identical\nto the corresponding CF wave function, and the two-quasiparticle wave function\nhas correct fractional charge and statistics and is numerically almost\nidentical to the corresponding CF wave function. We further show how to exactly\nrepresent the CF wavefunctions in the Jain series $\\nu = s/(2sp+1)$ as the CFT\ncorrelators of a new type of fermionic vertex operators, $V_{p,n}(z)$,\nconstructed from $n$ free compactified bosons; these operators provide the CFT\nrepresentation of composite fermions carrying $2p$ flux quanta in the $n^{\\rm\nth}$ CF Landau level.

It is here presented a new model of Evolutionary Neural Gas\n(ENG) with any topological constraints, trained by probabilistic laws depending\non the local distortion errors and the network dimension. The network is\nconsidered as a population of nodes that coexist in an ecosystem sharing local\nand global resources.
