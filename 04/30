The pairs diffuse on the extragalactic magnetic\nfield (EMF) and cascade emission has been suggested as a means for measuring\nits intensity. Limits on the IR background and EMF are reconsidered taking into\naccount cascade emissions. The cascade equations are solved numerically.\nAssuming a power-law intrinsic spectrum, the observed 100 MeV - 100 TeV\nspectrum is found as a function of the intrinsic spectral index and the\nintensity of the EMF. Cascades emit mainly at or below 100 GeV. The observed\nTeV spectrum appears softer than for pure absorption when cascade emission is\ntaken into account. The upper limit on the IR photon background is found to be\nrobust. Inversely, the intrinsic spectra needed to fit the TeV data are\nuncomfortably hard when cascade emission makes a significant contribution to\nthe observed spectrum.

From an observational point of view\nthis may give us a misleading picture. The faint stars may be the most common\nstars in the system but the morphological information obtained by observations\nof an object may be dominated by the color properties of the bright stars. Due\nto dynamical effects, such as energy equipartition, different masses of stars\nmay populate different regions in the object. Since stars are evolving in mass\nthe stellar evolution may also influence the dynamics of the system. Hence, if\none is interested in simulating what the morphology will look like through a\ntelescope, one needs to simulate in addition evolving stars and weight them by\ntheir luminosity. Therefore we need to combine simulations of the dynamical\nevolution and a stellar population synthesis at the same time. For the\ndynamical evolution part we use a parallel version of a direct N-body code,\nNBODY6++. This code also includes stellar evolution. We link the parameters\nfrom this stellar evolution routine to the BaSeL 2.0 stellar library. For\nisolated clusters we found results assimilable to standard stellar population\nsynthesis codes such as the PEGASE code. For clusters in a tidal field we found\nthat the integrated colors become relatively bluer due to energy equipartition\neffects.

Each of these\nmodels was set up to solve the combined Poisson-Boltzmann equation in a\nself-consistent way and optimized to reproduce the observed flaring. Results.\nBesides a massive extended halo of M ~ 1.8 10^{12} Msun, we find a\nself-gravitating dark matter disk with M=2 to 3 10^{11} Msun, including a dark\nmatter ring at 13 < R < 18.5 kpc with M = 2.2 to 2.8 10^{10} Msun.

Considering an expansion of the solution in\npowers of 1/N in a proper thermodynamic limit $N\\to +\\infty$, and neglecting\nsome collective effects, we derive a kinetic equation satisfied by the smooth\nvorticity field which is valid at order $O(1/N)$. This equation was obtained\npreviously [P.H. Chavanis, Phys. Rev. E, 64, 026309 (2001)] from a more\nabstract projection operator formalism. If we consider axisymmetric flows and\nmake a markovian approximation, we obtain a simpler kinetic equation which can\nbe studied in great detail. We discuss the properties of these kinetic\nequations in regard to the $H$-theorem and the convergence (or not) towards the\nstatistical equilibrium state. We also study the growth of correlations by\nexplicitly calculating the time evolution of the two-body correlation function\nin the linear regime. In a second part of the paper, we consider the relaxation\nof a test vortex in a bath of field vortices and obtain the Fokker-Planck\nequation by directly calculating the second (diffusion) and first (drift)\nmoments of the increment of position of the test vortex. A specificity of our\napproach is to obtain general equations, with a clear physical meaning, that\nare valid for flows that are not necessarily axisymmetric and that take into\naccount non-Markovian effects. A limitations of our approach, however, is that\nit ignores collective effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2007 14:45:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Jun 2008 08:53:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
