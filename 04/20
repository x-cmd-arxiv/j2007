The author method has two working versions: (1) the\nfirst variant the warm (hot) atmospheric air is lifted by the inflatable tube\nin a high altitude and atmospheric steam is condenced into freswater: (2) in\nthe second version, the warm air is pumped 20-30 meters under the sea-surface.\nIn the first version, wind and solar heating of air are used for causing air\nflow. In version (2) wind and propeller are used for causing air movment.\n  The first method does not need energy, the second needs a small amount.\nMoreover, in variant (1) the freshwater has a high pressure (>30 or more atm.)\nand can be used for production of energy such as electricity and in that way\nthe freshwater cost is lower. For increasing the productivity the seawater is\ninjected into air and solar air heater may be used. The solar air heater\nproduces a huge amount of electricity as a very powerful electricity generation\nplant. The offered electricity installation in 100 - 200 times cheaper than any\ncommon electric plant of equivalent output.\n  Key words: Extraction freshwater, method of getting freshwater, receiving\nenergy from atmosphere, powerful renewal electric plant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2007 17:18:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this paper we give a polynomial solution to that problem,\nmainly by showing that cycling is surjective, and using a result by Maffre\nwhich shows that pre-images under cycling can be computed fast.

The degree to which the relativistic corrections are\nimportant depends on the EMRB's orbital parameters.

The relativistic corrections\ntend to significantly change the waveform amplitude and phase relative to a\nNewtonian description, although some of this dephasing could be mimicked by\nparameter errors. The dephasing over several bursts could be of particular\nimportance not only to gravitational wave detection, but also to parameter\nestimation, since it is highly correlated to the spin of the massive black\nhole.

Our\napproach considers all possible scenarios for the set of species that will be\nextant at some future time, and weights them according to their likelihood\nunder an independent (but not identical) distribution on species extinctions.\nAlthough the number of extinction scenarios can typically be very large, we\nshow that there is a simple algorithm that will quickly compute this index. The\nmethod is implemented and applied to the prosimian primates as a test case, and\nthe associated species ranking is compared to a related measure (the `Shapley\nindex'). We describe indices for rooted and unrooted trees, and a modification\nthat also includes the focal taxon's probability of extinction, making it\ndirectly comparable to some new conservation metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 2007 02:37:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The\nmethod is designed to eliminate the problems inherent in the rate-equation\nformalism to surface chemistry. Here we report the first use of this method in\na chemical model of cold interstellar cloud cores that includes both gas-phase\nand surface chemistry. The surface chemical network consists of a small number\nof diffusive reactions that can produce molecular oxygen, water, carbon\ndioxide, formaldehyde, methanol and assorted radicals. METHOD: The simulation\nis started by running a gas-phase model including accretion onto grains but no\nsurface chemistry or evaporation. The starting surface consists of either flat\nor rough olivine. We introduce the surface chemistry of the three species H, O\nand CO in an iterative manner using our stochastic technique. Under the\nconditions of the simulation, only atomic hydrogen can evaporate to a\nsignificant extent. Although it has little effect on other gas-phase species,\nthe evaporation of atomic hydrogen changes its gas-phase abundance, which in\nturn changes the flux of atomic hydrogen onto grains. The effect on the surface\nchemistry is treated until convergence occurs. We neglect all non-thermal\ndesorptive processes. RESULTS: We determine the mantle abundances of assorted\nmolecules as a function of time through 2x10^5 yr.

To date,\nthis is the only detection of the source to be reported by any X/gamma-ray\nmission. Aims: To characterize the behaviour and hence the nature of the source\nthrough temporal and spectral IBIS analysis. Methods: Detailed spectral and\ntemporal analysis has been performed using standard INTEGRAL software OSA\nv.5.1. Results: To date, IGR J11321-5311 has been detected only once. It was\nactive for about 3.5 hours, a short and bright flare lasting about 1.5 hours is\nevident in the IBIS light curve. It reached a peak flux of about 80 mCrab or\n2.2x10E-9 erg cmE-2 sE-1 (20--300 keV),corresponding to a peak luminosity of\n1.1x10E37 erg sE-1 (assuming a distance of 6.5 kpc). During the outburst, the\nsource was detected with a significance of 18 sigma (20--300 keV) and 8 sigma\n(100--300 keV). The spectrum of the total outburst activity (17--300 keV) is\nbest fitted by the sum of a power law (Gamma=0.55+/-0.18) plus a black body\n(kT=1.0{+0.2}_{-0.3} keV), with no evidence for a break up to 300 keV. A\nspectral analysis at Science Window level revealed an evident hardening of the\nspectrum through the outburst. The IBIS data were searched for pulsations with\nno positive result. Conclusions: The X-ray spectral shape and the flaring\nbehaviour favour the hypothesis that IGR J11321-5311 is an Anomalous X-ray\nPulsar, though a different nature can not be firmly rejected at the present\nstage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 2007 15:54:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
