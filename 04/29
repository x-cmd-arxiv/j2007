The threshold energy for emission increases linear with the\nfree electron density. We conclude that the work function is a direct measure\nof the Hartree-Fock exchange energy. Remarkably, the emissions that have been\nobserved do not obey the Einstein-Millikan threshold relation for the photo\nelectric effect. By discrimination between requirements for energy and momentum\nwe deduce that electron emissions are trigged by photon momentum. We claim that\nthe photo electric effect is the result of a phase transition in an electron\ngas that connects a surface bound, condensed state to a free continuum state.\nThe assignment of a phase transition to the effect under consideration is\njustified by analyzing the behaviour of the Fermi-Dirac energy distribution\nupon raising the Fermi level.

Many authors have therefore considered gene duplication as a driving\nforce in shaping the topology of molecular networks. In particular it has been\nnoted that growth via duplication would act as an implicit way of preferential\nattachment, and thereby provide the observed broad degree distributions of\nmolecular networks.\n  Results: We extend current models of gene duplication and rewiring by\nincluding directions and the fact that molecular networks are not a result of\nunidirectional growth. We introduce upstream sites and downstream shapes to\nquantify potential links during duplication and rewiring. We find that this in\nitself generates the observed scaling of transcription factors for genome sites\nin procaryotes. The dynamical model can generate a scale-free degree\ndistribution, p(k)&prop; 1/k^&gamma;, with exponent &gamma;=1 in the\nnon-growing case, and with &gamma;>1 when the network is growing.\n  Conclusions: We find that duplication of genes followed by substantial\nrecombination of upstream regions could generate main features of genetic\nregulatory networks. Our steady state degree distribution is however to broad\nto be consistent with data, thereby suggesting that selective pruning acts as a\nmain additional constraint on duplicated genes.

Starting from the covariant gauge for the electromagnetic\nfield it is shown that the matching conditions to which the presence of the\nplasma sheet can be reduced are different from the commonly used ones. The\ndifference in the treatments does not show up in the Casimir force between two\nparallel sheets, but it is present in the Casimir-Polder force between a charge\nor a neutral atom and a sheet. At once, since the plasma sheet is a\nregularization of the conductor boundary conditions, this sheds light on the\ndifference in physics found earlier in the realization of conductor boundary\nconditions as 'thin' or 'thick' boundary conditions in\nPhys.Rev.D70(2004)085010.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Apr 2007 15:13:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
