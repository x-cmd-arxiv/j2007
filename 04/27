We then construct a parameterized family of\nnon-analytic functions with this same property. With the possible exception of\na finite number of zeros off the critical line, every function in the family\nsatisfies a Riemann Hypothesis. Moreover, when the parameter is not too large,\nthey have about the same number of zeros as the zeta-function, their zeros are\nall simple, and they \"repel\". The structure of these functions makes the reason\nfor the simplicity and repulsion of their zeros apparent and suggests a\nmechanism that might be responsible for the corresponding properties of the\nzeta-function's zeros. Computer evidence suggests that the zeros of functions\nin the family are remarkably close to those of the zeta-function (even for\nsmall values of the parameter), and we show that they indeed converge to them\nas the parameter increases. Furthermore, between zeros of the zeta-function,\nthe moduli of functions in the family tend to twice the modulus of the\nzeta-function. Both assertions assume the Riemann Hypothesis.

This is done by comparing the Bethe ansatz\npredictions for the four-loop anomalous dimension of finite-spin twist-two\noperators to BFKL constraints from high-energy scattering amplitudes in N=4\ngauge theory. We find disagreement, which means that the ansatz breaks down for\nlength-two operators at four-loop order. Our method supplies precision tools\nfor multiple all-loop tests of the veracity of any yet-to-be constructed set of\nexact spectral equations. Finally we present a conjecture for the exact\nfour-loop anomalous dimension of the family of twist-two operators, which\nincludes the Konishi field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Apr 2007 17:11:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2007 19:07:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We obtain dust-corrected SFRs by fitting the GALEX (UV) and SDSS\n(optical) photometry to a library of population synthesis models that include\ndust attenuation. For star-forming galaxies, our UV-based SFRs compare\nremarkably well with those derived from SDSS H alpha. Deviations from perfect\nagreement between these two methods are due to differences in the dust\nattenuation estimates. In contrast to H alpha, UV provides reliable SFRs for\ngalaxies with weak or no H alpha emission, and where H alpha is contaminated\nwith an emission from an AGN. We use full-SED SFRs to calibrate a simple\nprescription that uses GALEX UV magnitudes to produce good SFRs for normal\nstar-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as a function of stellar\nmass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGN, (2) those hosting an AGN, and\nfor (3) galaxies without H alpha emission. We find that the three have distinct\nstar formation histories, with AGN lying intermediate between the star-forming\nand the quiescent galaxies. Normal star forming galaxies (without an AGN) lie\non a relatively narrow linear sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strong\nAGN appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. Weak AGN,\nwhile also massive, have lower SFR, sometimes extending to the realm of\nquiescent galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxies\nthat smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent (red sequence)\ngalaxies via strong and weak AGN.

We continue the study started in the first paper of\nthis series by considering the stability properties of longitudinal flows along\nmagnetic flux tubes. A linear stability analysis was carried out to determine\ncriteria for the onset of instability in the framework of the approximation of\nthin magnetic flux tubes. In the non-dissipative case, we find Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability for flow velocities exceeding a critical speed that depends on the\nAlfv{\\'e}n speed and on the ratio of the internal and external densities.\nInclusion of a friction term proportional to the relative transverse velocity\nleads to a friction-driven instability connected with backward (or negative\nenergy) waves.

We give simple\nexpressions, explicitly dependent on the particle density, for the evolution of\npower in each mode as a function of red-shift. For typical starting red-shifts\nthe effect of finite particle number is to {\\it slow down} slightly the growth\nof power compared to that in the fluid limit (e.g. by about ten percent at half\nthe Nyquist frequency), and to induce also dispersion in the growth as a\nfunction of direction at a comparable level. In the limit that the initial\nred-shift tends to infinity, at fixed particle density, the evolution in fact\ndiverges from that in the fluid limit (described by the Zeldovich\napproximation). Contrary to widely held belief, this means that a simulation\nstarted at a red-shift much higher than the red-shift of shell crossing\nactually gives a worse, rather than a better, result. We also study how these\neffects are modified when there is a small-scale regularization of the\ngravitational force. We show that such a smoothing may reduce the anisotropy of\nthe discreteness effects, but it then {\\it increases} their average effect.\nThis behaviour illustrates the fact that the discreteness effects described\nhere are distinct from those usually considered in this context, due to\ntwo-body collisions.
