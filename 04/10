As such, the achievable dynamic range with our\nalgorithm surpasses the current practical limit of N-body codes by orders of\nmagnitude. This is particularly significant in studies of reionization, where\nthe dynamic range is the principal limiting factor. We test our halo-finding\nand HII bubble-finding algorithms independently against N-body simulations with\nradiative transfer and obtain excellent agreement. We compute the size\ndistributions of ionized and neutral regions in our maps. We find even larger\nionized bubbles than do purely analytic models at the same volume-weighted mean\nhydrogen neutral fraction. We also generate maps and power spectra of 21-cm\nbrightness temperature fluctuations, which for the first time include\ncorrections due to gas bulk velocities.

The\ncalculated total intensities of Ly-$\\alpha$ and the O VI doublet depend to a\nlesser degree on the density stratification and are comparable to the observed\nones for most of the considered density models. The widths of the observed\nprofiles of Ly-$\\alpha$ and Mg X are well reproduced by most of the considered\nelectron density stratifications, while for the O VI doublet only few\nstratifications give satisfying results.

The three fields situated toward the east, in\nthe Wing region, show very active current star formation. However, only in the\neastern field closest to the center do we find an enhancement of recent star\nformation with respect to a constant SFR(t). The fields corresponding to the\nwestern side of the SMC present a much less populated young MS, and the CF\nanalysis indicates that the SFR(t) greatly diminished around 2 Gyr ago in these\nparts.

Initially both planets migrate towards the Sun, and\nSaturn's migration tends to be faster. As a consequence, they eventually end up\nlocked in a mean motion resonance.

We\nassume that a fraction of jet energy, which is generated by an AGN, is\ntransferred to the surrounding gas as thermal energy. Combining a theoretical\nmodel of mass accretion onto black holes with a multiphase description of\nstar-forming gas, we self-consistently follow evolution of both galaxies and\ntheir central black holes. The novelty in our model is that we consider two\ndistinct accretion modes: standard radiatively efficient thin accretion disks\nand radiatively inefficient accretion flows which we will generically refer to\nas RIAFs; motivated by theoretical models for jet production in accretion\ndisks, we assume that only the RIAF is responsible for the AGN feedback. We\nfind that, after an initial episode of bursting star formation, the accretion\nrate onto the central black hole drops so that the accretion disk switches to a\nRIAF structure. At this point, the feedback from the AGN becomes efficient and\nslightly suppresses star formation in the galactic disk and almost completely\nhalts star formation in the bulge. As a result, the nucleus becomes a\nstochastically fuelled low-luminosity AGN (Seyfert galaxy) with recurrent\nshort-lived episodes of activity after the star bursts. Our model predicts\nseveral properties of the low-luminosity AGN including the bolometric\nluminosity, jet powers, the effect on kpc-scale of the radio jet and the AGN\nlifetime, which are in broad agreement with observations of Seyfert galaxies\nand their radio activity.

Furthermore,\nquantum gravity effects are expected to induce proton instability, indicating\nthat the higher energy cutoff scale must be above 10^{16}GeV. Quasi-realistic\nheterotic string models provide the arena to explore how perturbative quantum\ngravity affects the particle physics phenomenology.
